[Music]

00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,810
you

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:31,860
good morning all right welcome to github

00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:34,020
satellite we are so happy to be here

00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,780
with you today in beautiful Berlin and

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,970
we have quite a show for you today

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,129
welcome to the 800 people who are able

00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,519
to be in the room with us today and the

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:48,330
thousands more who are watching online

00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:51,000
this is a really exciting time for us to

00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:54,329
be at github more people are joining

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,579
github every day than ever before and so

00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,399
the audience here today represents the

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,460
more than 36 million developers who

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,680
called github home now today we have a

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,520
lot of great blockchain and I'm just

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,759
kidding there's no blockchain

00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:11,039
announcements we have a lot of great

00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:14,789
announcements to show you in 3 different

00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:16,410
areas security enterprise and community

00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:17,850
we're going to show you the work that

00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,000
we've been doing to make software

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,800
development more secure from end to end

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,070
to help better support and serve large

00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,869
organisations and enterprises and to

00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:30,390
serve open-source maintainer and

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:33,720
contributors but before we get into all

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,430
of that let's take a step back and talk

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,350
about what's really at the heart of

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,369
github which is the open source

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:45,000
community every day developers around

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:48,810
the world make millions of contributions

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,399
to open-source projects on github and we

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,799
thought it would be interesting and fun

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,020
to take our data set of that

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,960
contribution stream and actually

00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,869
visualize it on a globe and that's what

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,909
this is every little ray of light that

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,040
you see coming out of the earth and

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,810
going into space

00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,399
represents one contribution to an

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,370
open-source project from someone

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,310
somewhere on earth and I just I think

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,620
it's so cool this is real data it's over

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,140
a hundred million contributions over 30

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,730
days being visualized here and one of

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,890
the things that immediately stands out

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,130
for you when you look at this is how

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:28,980
global our community is right more than

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:32,070
80% of the contributions that occur to

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,410
open-source come from outside the US so

00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,270
in a way if your company

00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:40,260
your team is using open-source code

00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:43,140
you've already embraced promote work now

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,150
the chances are you have already started

00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,040
to use open source code because nearly

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:50,070
every software project on earth today

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,630
has open source dependencies so whether

00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,090
you're working at a large company or a

00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:57,600
start-up whether you're a scientist or

00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,970
student you rely every day on open

00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,550
source code and you rely on the people

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,830
who create it right every line of code

00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:07,260
that you write builds on the work of

00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,750
thousands of others and you can think

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,520
about it this way when you import an

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,750
open source library into your code

00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,690
you're not just adding code to your

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,750
project you are effectively adding a

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,910
team of developers to your extended team

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,100
you're actually almost giving them

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,740
commit access to your code that you then

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,970
put in production then you also get to

00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,850
benefit from the work they're doing

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:31,920
every day to improve their packages so

00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,020
this is the reality of building on

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,670
open-source and if anyone wants to make

00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,890
an editor extension that does this I

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,110
think that would be really cool but but

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,540
still in our heads we have this

00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,190
stereotype of the solitary developer

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,290
right when we think about the act of

00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:49,470
writing code we often think about a

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,780
developer alone in a dark room writes

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,150
just them in the computer writing code

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,950
and you sort of slip pizza under the

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,020
door and it gets converted into code and

00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,700
uploaded to the cloud that's still a

00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,510
mental image that we have when we think

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,739
about developers but in reality software

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,750
development is deeply collaborative

00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,970
right we're all a part of an

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,420
interconnected community of developers

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:15,470
and this morning I'm gonna tell you a

00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:18,540
story about how thousands of open-source

00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:21,500
contributors work together to help

00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:25,200
create a major scientific breakthrough

00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,810
this is the first ever picture of a

00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,520
black hole it was published just last

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,650
month in more than four and a half

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,690
billion people around the world have

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:37,190
seen this image it's very famous and it

00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:39,510
is a huge landmark achievement right

00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,610
scientists have theorized about black

00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,800
holes for decades but this is the first

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,840
time we've ever actually seen one and

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,030
this one is at the center of a galaxy

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,160
called m87

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,500
which is really far away it's 55 million

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,380
light-years away from us here in Berlin

00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,990
today in the scientists who created this

00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,780
picture used a global network of

00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,670
telescopes to generate a huge amount of

00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,860
data which they then composed into this

00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:07,980
image they spent years processing that

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,530
data to get this image and this is the

00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,690
moment of truth right this is dr. Cady

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,580
Bauman one of the lead developers and

00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:17,190
scientists on the project and one of my

00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,530
personal heroes and this has become an

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,870
iconic photo of this landmark human

00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:24,270
achievement I personally I love this

00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:27,000
photo because as developers we can all

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,160
identify with this feeling right it's

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,110
like it's that moment when your code

00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,630
finally just works you know when all

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,330
your tests pass when all your hard work

00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,340
kind of comes together it's a you look

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,020
at it and you feel that same feeling

00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,820
yourself and and it also makes you

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,120
wonder to to look at this picture right

00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:47,310
like what did it take to get to this

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,410
point what was involved what was the

00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,420
math and the science and the algorithms

00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,190
that were involved in getting here and

00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,450
then like what's going on on that

00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,050
chalkboard in the background there's a

00:05:54,450 --> 00:06:00,630
triangle there I have so many questions

00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,280
when I look at this and so here to

00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:04,530
answer those questions please welcome

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,900
via satellite from Boston Massachusetts

00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:12,800
dr. Katie Baumann Katie

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,800
[Applause]

00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,280
Caty we are honored and thrilled to have

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,110
you join us today you're in Boston right

00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,740
now and it's nearly 4:00 in the morning

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:31,460
there yeah I really wish I could have

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:33,380
been there in person well you're a busy

00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,700
person Katie so thanks for taking the

00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,220
time to join us in the middle of the

00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,440
night can you tell us a little bit about

00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:43,100
what it took to produce this image of a

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,930
black hole yeah of course so taking the

00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,000
first image of a black hole was a huge

00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,410
endeavor and took many people years of

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,330
hard work in order to build the

00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,940
computational telescope that made it

00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,590
possible to see the unseeable because

00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,480
the black hole we looked at is so far

00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,050
away from us it's 55 million light years

00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,000
away

00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,280
it appears incredibly small in the sky

00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,140
so it's about the same size to us as a

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,540
grain of sand would appear in Los

00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,760
Angeles when standing in New York and

00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,980
because it is so small we needed to

00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,200
build an earth-sized telescope in order

00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,610
to resolve the ring of light but since

00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,500
we couldn't build a single dish

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,210
telescope the size of the earth our

00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,310
collaboration instead spent over a

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:21,800
decade connecting telescopes from around

00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:24,410
the world using the precise timing of

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,970
atomic clocks and making an image from

00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,400
this telescope required that we not only

00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:30,410
develop new instrumentation but also

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,540
design algorithms to process and

00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:35,270
interpret the collected data to form the

00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:37,760
image and this required the expertise of

00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,620
a global team of over 200 collaborators

00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,480
who worked on developing cutting-edge

00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,510
instrumentation data processing

00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,460
theoretical simulations and analysis so

00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,440
my primary role in the project has been

00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,510
using techniques from both astronomy in

00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,490
computer science in order to combine

00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:54,500
information from the telescope's around

00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,680
the world to construct and verify that

00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,940
black hole image KT that's awesome

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,370
thanks for it's so wonderful to hear

00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,380
that from you directly now I have to say

00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,750
this picture of you has become so famous

00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:07,610
and I think part of the reason is the

00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,590
obvious sense of delight and that kind

00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,210
of feeling of Eureka you know that you

00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,730
have in that moment and that every

00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:17,450
developer knows a little bit what do you

00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:20,210
remember about that moment yeah

00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:22,640
definitely so this was really an amazing

00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,710
day it was a hot day in June the data

00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:27,320
had just finally been released to us for

00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,700
imaging and our collaboration decided

00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,810
actually to split ourselves into four

00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,370
teams

00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,260
by splitting ourselves into teams and

00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,779
having each team independently make an

00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:38,240
image we avoided a shared human bias in

00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:40,250
our results so anyway when the data was

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,770
released to us some of the members of

00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,720
the team I was on team one ran into a

00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,300
small room and we got ready to make an

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,100
image so we all had imaging scripts that

00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,200
we had each developed on our computers

00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,330
and we decided to press go on the stay

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,130
at the same time on all of them and so

00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,990
it was really amazing seeing the picture

00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:59,270
just start to appear on our screens and

00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:01,250
this picture was taken as that was

00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:04,610
happening and I was just flipping

00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:06,140
between awed disbelief excitement and

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,240
also just praying it wasn't some sort of

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:11,150
cruel joke and it wasn't really fake

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,640
data but most of all I think we were

00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:15,890
just so proud of what our collaboration

00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,650
had been able to achieve together and it

00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,029
was really an amazing day so Katie just

00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,260
described the scene a little more

00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:23,420
what is this room that you're in were

00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:27,440
you in Boston Massachusetts where this

00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:29,870
photo was taken yeah this picture was

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,330
taken in Cambridge Massachusetts in the

00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:34,580
office of the EHT director Shep Dolman

00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:36,080
and this is a building where a number of

00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:38,450
us actually spend a lot of time working

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,370
together but the funny thing about this

00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:43,520
photo is actually it's impossible to see

00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:45,080
Andrew my collaborator so unlike the m87

00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,210
black hole image which was truly a

00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,130
collaborative effort Andrew can claim

00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:51,470
sole credit for snapping this picture of

00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,810
me as he sat next at next to me making a

00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,910
picture of his own and similarly

00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,830
similarly on the other side of the table

00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:59,930
where a number of other team members and

00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:02,780
many others in rooms around the world

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:04,070
we're doing the exact same thing a lot

00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,540
of your other team members like you

00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,130
mentioned Andrew have become kind of

00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,690
famous and celebrated in their own right

00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:11,120
for their work on this project as well

00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:13,100
and in fact we have another surprise for

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,720
the audience here today Katie do you

00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,339
want to do the honors yeah sure so

00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,690
actually six of my colleagues from the

00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:24,410
team are there in Berlin at the

00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:27,190
conference with you all come on out give

00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:27,190
me a big round of applause

00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:46,280
it is so awesome to have the core team

00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,140
that worked on the software behind this

00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,360
black hole image here today I can't tell

00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,910
how much we're all nerding out over

00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,350
having you on stage why don't we go down

00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,460
the line and have you each introduce

00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,540
yourselves and just say a couple words

00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,640
about what you worked on

00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:02,120
so I'm Andrew I work on imaging so

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,430
designing sort of software to experiment

00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,320
with test and validate new methods for

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:10,520
converting the EH T's challenging data

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:13,250
into images that we can interpret I'm

00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:15,230
Kathy I'm that primary developer of one

00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,780
of imaging software packages and also

00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,730
developing new imaging techniques that

00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,500
created a first ever picture of black

00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:25,310
hole from the calibrated telescope

00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:27,350
dataset hi I'm Sarah work on data

00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,450
calibration primarily on modeling the

00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:33,080
behavior and sensitivity of all the

00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:35,720
different telescopes in our network hi

00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,330
I'm CK I occupy the cloud computing

00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,190
infrastructure for HT and I scale our

00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:44,270
algorithm and develop simulation

00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:46,430
software I'm Roman and a core developer

00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,050
of a parameter estimation framework and

00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:51,890
I do theoretical modeling to figure out

00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:53,600
why the image looks the way it does I'm

00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:55,490
Lindy I'm the primary developer of one

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,170
of our data pipelines so this is a

00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:59,750
process that takes the large and complex

00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:01,610
datasets from experiment and reduces it

00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,320
down to a much smaller and much simpler

00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,330
set of data that can be used to form the

00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,010
image I kind of want to applaud right

00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:16,710
now so let's do it

00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:18,870
[Applause]

00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,670
now Sarah you mentioned that you worked

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,890
on data calibration can you tell us what

00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,810
what that is so what we recorded the

00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:26,940
telescope's is actually mostly noise so

00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:29,160
the calibration process basically is the

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,470
process of combining all the data and

00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,750
taking out the very weak signal in the

00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:35,700
recordings and strengthening the signal

00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,440
modeling the instrument and atmosphere

00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,270
to be able to average down from

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,490
petabytes of data to all the very nice

00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:44,339
megabytes of strong signal data that

00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:46,410
then get passed down to analysis that's

00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:47,970
great and then Andrew you mentioned that

00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,410
you worked on imaging which I guess is

00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,779
kind of like a next step in the process

00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,190
can you tell us about how that works yes

00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,899
we don't actually have the resources yet

00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,640
to build a single earth sized telescope

00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,670
so as Katie mentioned the HD is a

00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,470
virtual telescope we need to devise new

00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:03,450
software and strategies for converting

00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:05,420
our data into images and inferring what

00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:09,089
it's a single telescope would see

00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:11,190
awesome and then CK Katie mentioned and

00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:12,839
and I think you mentioned also a little

00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,399
bit about the open source components

00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,930
that you used in the project can you

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,600
tell us about your stack with languages

00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:21,540
and packages did you use yes we use many

00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,959
open source libraries and once the data

00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:27,360
hit calibration and imaging status era

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:31,050
and Judis just described we are mainly

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,630
on a Python stack so your lump I type I

00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:35,790
SQL pie and my polyp are always very

00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:39,000
important to us okay that's awesome

00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:40,800
now this team is actually gonna be here

00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,459
all day and they're going to give a talk

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,260
at 5:20 today on this stage going into a

00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,610
lot more detail about the project and

00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,320
all the details of everything they did

00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,600
thank you all very much for being here

00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:55,950
and Katie thank you again for dialing in

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,320
from Boston thanks for having us this

00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:00,120
team is just the tip of the iceberg more

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,980
than 200 people worked on the event

00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,750
horizon telescope team and as I

00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,550
mentioned last week to Congress we're

00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,230
deeply grateful to all the open-source

00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:10,140
contributors who made our work possible

00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:11,640
as well thank you let's give these folks

00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,940
a big round of applause thank you all

00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,940
very much

00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:23,590
Thanks it's just so cool to have that

00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,310
team here I've been like handling them

00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:29,140
constantly

00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:31,330
so now as both Katie and CK mentioned

00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,550
the team actually used a lot of Python

00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:35,530
code and they made use of a lot of

00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,840
open-source Python libraries and the

00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:39,670
work that they did and their code is all

00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,440
public so we can actually go to the repo

00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,720
and look at it and we can also look at

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,510
their dependency graph and here it is

00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,010
you can see they've got quite a few

00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,710
different dependencies in the graph and

00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:52,690
in fact all together in the complete set

00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:54,460
of transitive dependencies that made up

00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:56,620
these Python scripts there's over a

00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,080
hundred different open-source Python

00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,880
packages and some of these are probably

00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,350
used pretty heavily some used a little

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,830
less oh but it's a really interesting

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:07,750
list to kind of look through and as we

00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:12,040
were scanning through this out of

00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:13,990
curiosity we started to wonder how many

00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:17,620
people did it take to build all of this

00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:20,650
right how many individuals contributed

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:23,890
to the full dependency graph that the

00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:26,260
event horizon team used and so we ran

00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:31,560
the query and the number turns out to be

00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:34,240
more than 21,000 people it's incredible

00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,020
21,000 people around the world were

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,580
involved in building these scripts and

00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:42,640
we have another surprise for you as it

00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:45,820
happens some of those 21,000 people are

00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,350
here in the audience today and so if you

00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:51,340
worked on any of these projects please

00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:53,550
stand up turn around face the rest of

00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,550
the audience

00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:06,269
we are so lucky to have with us today

00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:10,089
maintain errs and core contributors to

00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:13,779
numpy matplotlib sigh hi Astro pie

00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:16,299
panda's Python dynasty scythe on Kiwi

00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:20,350
solver and many other packages these

00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:22,929
people represents the 21,000 who were

00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:24,549
part of this extended team that made

00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:26,649
this work possible we're so proud to

00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:28,209
have you all here thank you each for

00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:30,519
your contributions to human progress

00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:30,890
let's give them a big hand again thanks

00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:37,780
everybody

00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:42,520
[Applause]

00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:45,100
thank you all okay so the image that

00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,600
needed a planet-sized telescope

00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,420
also really did truly require a

00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,370
planet-sized team to build it and by the

00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,980
way at least one of the people who's

00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:56,080
here when we called them up and invited

00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,600
them to come did not know that their

00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,460
work had contributed to the black hole

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,630
image and was very moved by that and I

00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,730
thought that was really cool

00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:08,350
it's sort of the magic of open source

00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:10,150
now as Katie said this is when you look

00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,920
at the team that's working directly on a

00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:14,319
codebase in a way you're looking at the

00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:16,660
tip of the iceberg right this isn't just

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,339
the story of this one software project

00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:21,040
this is the story of all software

00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:22,900
projects today that use open source so

00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,490
the tip of the iceberg goes direct

00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,689
contributors are the ones who are

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,910
building your code but below the

00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:29,950
waterline are the developers who are

00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:31,750
contributing to your dependencies and

00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,550
we've been using the phrase community

00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,380
contributors to refer to these people

00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:38,380
they're like the people who are here in

00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,940
the audience today and one of the things

00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,250
you might be thinking is well okay this

00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,080
event horizon team they wrote their code

00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,570
in Python they used a lot of high-level

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,700
astronomy libraries maybe they're an

00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,620
outlier right maybe this twenty one

00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,110
thousand number is a typically high and

00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:56,350
we were curious about that too so we

00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:58,780
decided to sample a thousand of the most

00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:01,690
popular repos on github including repos

00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:04,030
like WordPress and rails and tensorflow

00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,830
and others and we ran the query and we

00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,720
averaged it all together and we

00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:11,650
discovered that on average these

00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:15,990
thousand projects had more than 74,000

00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:15,990
contributors it's amazing

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,640
this is the actual size of our teams

00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:26,850
right think about it for a second this

00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:30,270
is more software engineers than work at

00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:32,070
Google or Apple or Microsoft it's

00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:35,250
actually more people than there are in

00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:37,650
the entire employee base of 90% of the

00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:39,120
fortune 500 and for a couple of you out

00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,580
there this is more people than the

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,400
population of Burning Man so it's a

00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,960
pretty big group and it's a testament to

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,200
how software development works today

00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,540
right it takes a community to write code

00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,460
so to make this interconnected community

00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,410
and the reality of this more concrete

00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,570
for each of us in our everyday work

00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:00,000
we're introducing two new features to

00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:02,820
github today community contributors and

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,160
dependent repositories so today if you

00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,690
go to a repo like this is numpy you can

00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:10,320
see that we actually call out how many

00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:12,030
contributors that repo has today well

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,470
we're adding a hovercard so when you

00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:15,150
bring your mouse up you can see the

00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:17,820
total number of community contributors

00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:20,400
you can see who they are browse them and

00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:23,640
get to know your extended team it's

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,620
pretty cool then we're adding a new

00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,270
signal for you to understand a repost

00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,860
popularity so right now when you look at

00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,380
a repo you can see how many Forks it has

00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:34,350
how many stars it has many people are

00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:36,870
watching it today now when we're adding

00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:39,450
used by so you can see how many other

00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:42,000
projects on github make use of the

00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:44,549
dependencies of the packages that are in

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,440
that repo we hope this is a useful

00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:49,559
signal of a repost popularity that can

00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,030
help you make better choices and for you

00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,530
as a maintainer it's pretty cool you can

00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:55,710
see how many people are using your stuff

00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:57,990
you can even click on it and see exactly

00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:01,290
who those users are and what's repos

00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:03,150
you've joined in the last week or so we

00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:05,040
screen shot at numpy a week ago and it

00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:07,290
went up by about a thousand users in the

00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,940
week so that was pretty cool so I'm

00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,260
personally really excited about these

00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,169
two little features they're rolling out

00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:14,490
today community contributors is Python

00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:15,960
first and they'll roll out to the other

00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,970
language communities after that and

00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,410
dependent repositories is available for

00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:22,679
all the languages supported by the

00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:25,260
github dependency graph okay so at

00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,000
github our mission is to build the

00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:29,190
global platform for developer

00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,040
collaboration and to make more stories

00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,130
like the one you

00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:35,140
this morning possible everyday and we're

00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:36,820
really here to serve you we're here to

00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,640
serve the developers and the companies

00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:41,650
who count on github every day and we've

00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,840
been spending a lot of time the last six

00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:46,300
months in conversations with developers

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,120
maintainer x' and our customers and

00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:52,420
using your input to shape our roadmap

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,770
and so today the new features that we're

00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,300
going to show you are based on the

00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:58,270
things that you've told us that you want

00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,560
and we're gonna start with security so

00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,270
to tell you more about that please

00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:09,700
welcome github head of product

00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:10,950
shanku new yogi shanku thank you good

00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,800
morning everyone

00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:19,810
wow that was those inspiring wasn't it

00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:21,850
yeah it is amazing to think of what the

00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:23,800
interconnected community can do for

00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:25,860
software development right like think

00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:29,170
about strangers from across the world

00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:31,030
coming together collaborating and

00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:33,220
building amazing things and even

00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:36,760
creating human progress right that's so

00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:39,130
powerful with that power there's also a

00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,080
need for responsibility we've got to

00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:44,740
build software that is secure and

00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:46,600
trustworthy because the strength of this

00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,550
community is built on trust right we

00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,040
have to trust each other and the

00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:53,920
software that we're building is for a

00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,390
purpose it's for our users right and our

00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:59,080
users need to be able to trust that

00:21:55,390 --> 00:22:01,780
software and trust us so the challenge

00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,940
of open source security and Trust isn't

00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:07,540
some abstract thing it's something that

00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:09,820
we all need to take apart in and for

00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:12,780
sure there are challenges let me tell

00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:16,360
you a story this is the story of

00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:20,200
something called event stream event

00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:22,990
stream is a node module it's used in

00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:26,230
tens of thousands of projects including

00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:28,240
in a lot of enterprises and event stream

00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:30,430
is maintained by one developer and an

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,130
amazing developer who builds a lot of

00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:35,380
other popular software projects and one

00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:37,810
day he got approached by another

00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:40,120
developer who offered to make event

00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:41,860
stream better and of course he accepted

00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,660
that offer right it's what you do in

00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,980
this open source community when people

00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,919
want to

00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:49,890
help you you trust them but this person

00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:53,790
was a malicious actor and what they did

00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:57,860
was they put a vulnerability into event

00:22:53,790 --> 00:23:00,630
stream and they got it published and

00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:03,000
they did it actually very cleverly they

00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:05,580
put it in a dependency and made it very

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,179
hard to detect and it took almost a

00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,880
month

00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:11,790
for that issue to be found and in that

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,120
time the package got downloaded millions

00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:16,860
of times this could have been a disaster

00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,150
except that they decided to do a very

00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,330
specific attack they didn't attack

00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:23,429
everyone they attacked one app that was

00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:25,590
using event stream it was a Bitcoin

00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:28,200
wallet app called copay and sure enough

00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:30,720
copay picked up that package they ended

00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,730
up having to deal with their users and

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,040
send them warnings but it could have

00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:36,960
been a lot worse all right and these

00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,840
kinds of challenges are gonna happen and

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,940
and not just because there are malicious

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,280
actors out there but because of us

00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,169
because we're humans right humans make

00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,910
mistakes and when those lead to

00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:50,610
vulnerability issues we need to deal

00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:54,929
with them so we can all use better tools

00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:56,760
to help us do that now github we believe

00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:58,140
that the power of that interconnected

00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,540
community that helps you build software

00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:03,150
also helps you build more secure

00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:05,040
software if you think about all the

00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,870
people involved in this right and

00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,600
keeping stuff secure you've got

00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:10,950
researchers who are finding issues

00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,650
maintain errs who are having to go fix

00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:15,450
them developers who are having to stay

00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:17,880
on top of their dependencies and make

00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:19,679
pick up those changes and then security

00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,020
teams or we're kind of keeping an eye on

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,330
it all we need to help everyone

00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:27,480
collaborate better so we can be more

00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:29,549
secure and I want to share today some of

00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,070
the tools that github is providing to

00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:33,270
help do that

00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:36,809
so let's start with developers and

00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:38,640
administrators now in November 2017 we

00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:41,460
release something called security

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,940
vulnerability alerts for github with

00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:46,790
this github now actually scans all of

00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,200
your dependencies and continuously

00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:51,480
compares them against vulnerability data

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,480
and sends you an alert whenever you've

00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:57,570
got a vulnerable dependency because

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,870
we're github we can do this on a planet

00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:01,020
stay

00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:04,590
so in just the last 12 months we have

00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:08,220
actually sent almost 27 million

00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:10,110
vulnerability alerts to developers now

00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,000
you're probably wondering how many of

00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:14,390
them actually got addressed we'll talk

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,390
about that later

00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:19,799
but if you don't have owner ability

00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:22,230
alerts signed up today you can go to

00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:23,750
github and sign up but I'm also excited

00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:26,429
to announce today that we're now

00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:28,320
generally making available github

00:25:26,429 --> 00:25:32,909
vulnerability alerts for github

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,980
Enterprise Server so with this even if

00:25:32,909 --> 00:25:37,409
you're doing local development insert on

00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,600
your server you can connect to github

00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:43,679
and you can get the same alerts to help

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:45,510
keep your code secure I'm also excited

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,140
to announce today that we're partnering

00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:51,570
with white source and white source is an

00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:53,700
industry leader in vulnerability data

00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:56,429
they collect vulnerability data from

00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:58,350
lots of different places and thanks to

00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:00,510
white source we are now making that

00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:03,600
vulnerability data available through

00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:07,529
alerts in github so we're very excited

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,840
about that partnership now alerts are

00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:12,450
great but what if you want to keep on

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:15,600
top of all of your dependencies right

00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:18,059
github dependency insights helps you do

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,539
that think of github dependency insights

00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:23,270
as a full overview of all of your

00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:26,100
dependencies so you can go and

00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:28,470
understand each dependency you can go

00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:32,070
look at what's changed there who's

00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:33,929
working on it you can get this overview

00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:36,409
of all of the security state of your

00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:39,450
dependencies we're also including

00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:41,070
license information so that you can

00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:44,090
actually understand your license

00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:46,679
compliance state of all your code so

00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:48,899
dependency insights is kind of an

00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:51,779
essential tool for developers and

00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:54,240
security teams and compliance teams to

00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:56,039
work together to understand the security

00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,870
and compliance state of your software

00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:04,950
and it's available today now let's go

00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:08,370
ahead and look at how bugs get found and

00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:10,620
fixed now at github we've got a

00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:11,309
dedicated team that works on security

00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,830
issues

00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:16,129
amazing team but if you've got an open

00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:18,929
source project write for a maintainer

00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:21,090
this is a hard problem right because if

00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:24,090
a security issue comes in from somewhere

00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:28,730
all of a sudden this interconnected

00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:32,070
community becomes a very dark place

00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:34,710
right you've got to go race against time

00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:36,690
to go investigate the issue figure out

00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:39,450
what happened you've got to go figure

00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:41,279
out a patch get that patch built and

00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:44,399
tested get it out there issue an

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,960
advisory and all the time you're hoping

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:49,740
that you don't show up on Hacker News

00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:52,860
right right it's not not fun is it fun

00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:55,679
no so what you need is better tools to

00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:59,149
do that and today we're announcing a

00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:02,009
tool set of tools to help you so first

00:27:59,149 --> 00:28:04,379
how does a security researcher find you

00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:06,690
well in the industry there's a

00:28:04,379 --> 00:28:08,820
convention for this every big project

00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:11,460
has it it's called the security policy

00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,860
it helps researchers understand how to

00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:16,379
disclose bugs responsibly to you now you

00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:20,159
can have a security policy too because

00:28:16,379 --> 00:28:22,080
we're building that into github so with

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,789
github security policy you can now

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,830
author a security policy for your

00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:27,480
project or you can author it for your

00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:30,389
entire org and it will automatically

00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,039
cascade down to every repo and now

00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:36,419
researchers know how to work with you

00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:38,490
that's an important first step now once

00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:40,980
you've got that what happens when an

00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:42,690
issue comes in right like what you'd

00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:46,529
like to do is you'd like to go to a nice

00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:48,119
place with the people you trust in a

00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:51,119
private environment and be able to

00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:53,399
investigate that issue and you can now

00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:56,340
do that with something called maintainer

00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:59,090
security advisories let's take a look at

00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:01,740
how it works so a new issue comes in and

00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:04,019
what I can do is go ahead and create

00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,999
something called a draft Advisory this

00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:09,659
is something new and github that we're

00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:11,999
announcing today so once you've done

00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:13,799
that what what you now create is this

00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:16,080
kind of entire private workspace where

00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:17,759
you can work on the problem so you can

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,740
invite in the people you trust

00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:22,320
maybe that security researcher that file

00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,690
the issue you can go discuss you can go

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,740
investigate in a

00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:29,539
the private space when you're ready you

00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,480
can create something called a temporary

00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:35,240
private Fork this is a completely

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,129
private fork of your code that is

00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,409
available only to the people that you

00:29:37,129 --> 00:29:42,590
invite and now you can work with them on

00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:46,100
a security issue you can build and test

00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:48,139
the patch you'll get a unique get URL so

00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:50,779
you can use it with your get tools and

00:29:48,139 --> 00:29:53,120
when you're ready you can go ahead and

00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:56,570
merge that pull request back into your

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:59,690
code we also provide a set of tools to

00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:02,389
help you author that advisory and submit

00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:04,299
it to get up and when you do that we'll

00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:08,659
take care of the rest for you we will

00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:11,539
publish that advisory and voila there's

00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:13,399
a published advisory ready to go so what

00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:17,029
we're doing with this set of tools is

00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:19,549
really helping build security best

00:30:17,029 --> 00:30:23,809
practices in open source and that's good

00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:28,580
for everyone right so with these tools

00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:31,669
and working together with our great

00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:33,320
security vendors such as hacker 1 we

00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:35,750
want to build these kinds of security

00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:40,970
best practices directly in the github

00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:42,950
now organizations like the CNC F have a

00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:45,769
bunch of custom security tools today and

00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:47,539
they're going to be switching to using a

00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:49,820
lot of our github tools and we're going

00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:51,860
to be working with them but you can have

00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:54,259
these tools too because our maintainer

00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:57,169
security tools are going to be available

00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:59,350
to every single open-source project for

00:30:57,169 --> 00:30:59,350
free

00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:14,880
so now let's get to the hard part doing

00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:19,650
those patches yeah now it turns out the

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:21,480
industry data shows that more than 70%

00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:25,740
of vulnerabilities actually remain

00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:27,930
unpatched for three months a lot of them

00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:30,540
go over a year and you've probably seen

00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:33,600
some news stories about this right you

00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:36,480
can do better right so we went looking

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,070
at how people have tried to solve this

00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,530
problem how people are dealing with it

00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:42,840
what we actually found was a number of

00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:46,140
partners in our ecosystem have tried to

00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:50,220
already go solve this problem and one of

00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:53,640
them is dependable so dependable is a

00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:55,320
product that takes a great approach to

00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,690
trying addressing this problem of

00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,380
patching vulnerabilities so to tell us

00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,850
more about it

00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:02,870
I'd like to invite the co-founder of

00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:06,780
dependable gray Baker to the stage great

00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:12,060
[Applause]

00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:14,250
hi great hi Shan key so tell us about

00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,510
how dependable came about what were what

00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:18,840
was the problem you were trying to solve

00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:21,090
well in 2004 I was working at a startup

00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,760
and one of my Jobs was managing our

00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:26,460
dependencies we were payments company so

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,660
we really cared about stability but we

00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,570
also didn't want to end there from

00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:32,430
outdated or insecure dependencies we

00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:34,370
wanted all the great features that

00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:36,990
maintainer czar pushing all the time and

00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:38,610
what we decided was that the best

00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:40,710
approach was to update our dependencies

00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:42,330
little and often so we always knew

00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:45,600
exactly what we were deploying they were

00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:47,760
always just small changes the problem

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,430
was that that required me to create

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:53,100
dozens of pull requests to update our

00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:54,540
dependencies every single week and they

00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,040
were beautiful pull requests I was

00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,780
pulling in the change Lord in any

00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,820
release notes that were there but it was

00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:01,830
tedious manual work creating them and

00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:04,530
that's what we built depend a lot to

00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:07,740
solve so you build a bot to automate

00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:10,800
yourself right yeah so so tell us what

00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:13,890
happened next well we used to get up by

00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:16,440
API to build this bot and it's basically

00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:21,410
like having me on your team of the hume

00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:22,650
dependencies for you so everyday

00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:24,210
dependable

00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,800
checks whether or not you're using the

00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,810
latest version of everything that you

00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:30,330
depend on and if you're not then it

00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:32,730
opens individual pull requests to update

00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:36,210
you I think we've got an example pull

00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:38,340
request to show so in that pull request

00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:40,530
you can see it's just doing a very small

00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:42,390
update it's a patch and it's pulled in

00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:43,950
the change log the release notes and in

00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:45,720
this case because it's fixing a

00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:48,300
vulnerability details of the

00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,620
vulnerability that's being fixed the

00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,710
idea is to make that pull request

00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:55,140
there's easy to merge as possible so if

00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:58,440
I make a change everyone who's using my

00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:00,390
code now gets a pull request with the

00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,040
change and all the information they need

00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:05,130
to be able to accept that pull request

00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:07,410
yeah exactly so if you were maintainer

00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:09,210
and you push a new version then pretty

00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:10,800
soon dependable will create pull

00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:13,440
requests for everybody that's using it

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,020
to update to that version and we've had

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:19,020
over 500,000 of these pull requests

00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,020
merged just in the last year including

00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,790
by some

00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:23,740
fantastic customers who have really

00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:25,419
helped us along the way with grateful

00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:27,669
for all the feedback from folks of

00:34:25,419 --> 00:34:31,630
webpack mastodons and many others

00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:33,040
wonderful now there is one pull request

00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:34,270
that i think you and i are very excited

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,520
about yeah

00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:37,690
there is shall we show them I think we

00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:42,120
should all right

00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:44,560
I am super thrilled to announce that

00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,429
dependable is now a part of the github

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:53,020
family

00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:53,590
welcome to github great and that's not

00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:58,210
all

00:34:53,590 --> 00:35:00,790
is it it's not we couldn't be more

00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:02,350
excited to be joining github and we've

00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:04,090
got a feature to announce for everybody

00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:07,930
today which is that we've built

00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:09,820
automated security fixes so now whenever

00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:12,760
you receive a security alert from github

00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:16,810
you'll also get a pull request to fix

00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:19,620
that insecure vulnerability awesome how

00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:19,620
does one sign up

00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:28,910
automated security fixes are available

00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:31,339
today you can opt-in from the repo

00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:33,470
settings page on any repo they support

00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:35,210
all of the languages that security alert

00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:37,809
supports and we'll be rolling them out

00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:42,400
to everybody over the next two months

00:35:37,809 --> 00:35:42,400
wonderful thank you gray Thank You janky

00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:50,380
so this interconnected community we have

00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:53,779
we believe that using that power

00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:56,599
together with great tools helps us write

00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:58,309
more secure code be able to use other

00:35:56,599 --> 00:36:00,769
people's code with more confidence and

00:35:58,309 --> 00:36:02,990
ultimately build applications our users

00:36:00,769 --> 00:36:03,890
trust and today we're giving you a set

00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:05,539
of tools to do that

00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:08,619
and we want to we'll continue to work

00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:08,619
with you thank you

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,670
now we want to share how our

00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:21,280
interconnected community actually

00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:24,040
extends into enterprises and large

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,900
organizations and helps them be part of

00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,119
the community too and to tell you about

00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,619
that I'm super excited to have Dana

00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,570
Lawson vice president of engineering

00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:38,199
join us Dana

00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:38,199
[Applause]

00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:45,990
danke Shon ku I've been waiting to say

00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:47,850
that for a long time how do y'all what a

00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:49,560
privilege it is to be here today in

00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:51,690
beautiful Berlin and I don't know about

00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,400
you but this face is just absolutely

00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:56,010
mind-blowing I've never been at a

00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,440
conference like this so as you've heard

00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:00,660
from NAT shanku and gray that the world

00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,660
of open-source is truly an

00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:05,940
interconnected community not only does

00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:08,460
it take a global team to create your

00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,680
favourite open-source technologies the

00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:13,200
same is true for enterprise products and

00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:17,940
companies that we've come to know love

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:20,370
and trust did you know that enterprise

00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:23,220
companies are the largest contributors

00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:25,890
and consumers of open-source and we are

00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:28,590
so proud to play a part in the products

00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:30,810
that these software companies make with

00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:33,420
over 2 million organizations trusting

00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:36,150
github as well as over half of the

00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,770
Fortune 50 companies use github

00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:41,190
Enterprise for their internal

00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:43,830
development I love that these companies

00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:45,090
are sharing their code and ideas but the

00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:46,950
downside for these large-scale

00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:48,210
organizations that it's just still too

00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:50,910
difficult to understand how they're

00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:52,950
using open-source how secure they are in

00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:54,560
addition to what packages and products

00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:57,330
they're bringing into their ecosystems

00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,170
but more importantly how their broader

00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:03,300
teams are innovating and collaborating

00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:05,490
here at github we listened and I am so

00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:08,430
pleased to announce available today

00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:10,410
these four new enterprise features that

00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:12,660
will help not only me as an engineering

00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:14,990
leader but countless other companies as

00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:19,680
they continue to innovate and they our

00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:22,410
enterprise accounts internal repos new

00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,950
roles and permissions and organization

00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,950
insights

00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:33,579
so let's dive in last October we

00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:36,099
introduced a limited beta for enterprise

00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:38,109
account feature with enterprise accounts

00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:40,809
you can group all the organization's in

00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:43,569
a single account making it easier for

00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:47,200
you to manage the needs of every org and

00:38:43,569 --> 00:38:49,329
team in your company but just with

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,769
enterprise accounts we also wanted to

00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:52,839
make it easier for companies to share

00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:55,749
their code across the organization in a

00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:58,450
safe open and secure way before you only

00:38:55,749 --> 00:39:01,269
had two choices private and public repos

00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:04,089
and today we're introducing internal

00:39:01,269 --> 00:39:06,190
repos I'm sure you're like what our

00:39:04,089 --> 00:39:09,069
internal repos they don't make no sense

00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:11,950
we already a private repos I know right

00:39:09,069 --> 00:39:13,720
but internal repos are way for an

00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:15,430
helping Enterprise company state

00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,619
interconnected because software

00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:20,920
development is truly a team sport

00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:24,489
it takes designers tech support cells

00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:26,170
even bosses like me and others in an

00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:27,430
organization to build these products we

00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:29,200
love because it's not just about

00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:31,989
developing code it's about everything

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,329
that we do to make it wonderful so now

00:39:31,989 --> 00:39:36,130
with enterprise and eternal repose you

00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:38,229
can broadly share your projects where

00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:39,130
every user in an enterprise account can

00:39:38,229 --> 00:39:41,589
participate

00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:43,660
no more trudging through going hey can I

00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:45,759
get access to that can I get access to

00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:49,359
that now you have access to that so

00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:52,749
you're welcome so we created enterprise

00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:54,400
accounts yeah it's a big deal yeah so we

00:39:52,749 --> 00:39:56,559
created enterprise accounts to easily

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,719
manner your org and internal repos to

00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:00,009
inter source your projects but we also

00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:01,299
wanted to help maintain errs because

00:40:00,009 --> 00:40:03,700
it's not all about enterprise it's

00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:05,349
really about y'all and enterprises like

00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:07,719
have the ability to give the right

00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:09,249
access at the right time because like I

00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:11,589
said it's not just about writing code

00:40:09,249 --> 00:40:13,749
it's about everything else that happens

00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:15,489
and it's just equally as important our

00:40:13,749 --> 00:40:17,049
goal is to enable everyone to contribute

00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:19,059
no matter if you're new to open source

00:40:17,049 --> 00:40:22,420
or you're an enterprise company with

00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:24,279
nuance needs so we've worked to overhaul

00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,259
our permission model to introduce new

00:40:24,279 --> 00:40:29,469
roles for your team the triage and

00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:31,089
maintain role the triage role allows

00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:33,160
users the ability to manage issues

00:40:31,089 --> 00:40:35,170
without having to Rabb write access to

00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,309
your code so I know you maintainer ZAR

00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,869
gonna feel pretty good about that when

00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:40,359
those noobs get in your repo

00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:43,749
and you're like I don't know you but I

00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:44,369
love you but you can't write so you're

00:40:43,749 --> 00:40:47,439
welcome

00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:49,359
the maintained role which has most of

00:40:47,439 --> 00:40:51,160
the rights of admins but removes the

00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:53,619
ability to do dangerous thing like

00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:55,719
delete repos because believe me you

00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:57,999
don't want to do that not that I have

00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:59,319
but maybe I okay I have but whatever you

00:40:57,999 --> 00:41:01,599
don't wanna be that person don't be me

00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:05,049
that's that's why I don't you know

00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,789
anyway now that we have all these tools

00:41:05,049 --> 00:41:09,549
to better enable your enterprise teams

00:41:06,789 --> 00:41:11,769
to ship smarter faster and more secure

00:41:09,549 --> 00:41:12,999
we also wanted to give them the ability

00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:15,309
to understand how they're using their

00:41:12,999 --> 00:41:17,229
development work explos with

00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:18,759
organization insights you can now

00:41:17,229 --> 00:41:20,949
understand where your teams are spending

00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:22,779
time in these workflows what languages

00:41:20,949 --> 00:41:24,549
you're using and what's changing over

00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:26,650
time in your company's ecosystem and

00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:28,569
this is just the beginning with org

00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,130
insights our goal is to be the

00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:35,170
instrument panel for your development

00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:37,539
lifecycle now listen I am sure you're as

00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:40,479
excited as I am about these features and

00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:42,910
we are bringing to developers maintainer

00:41:40,479 --> 00:41:44,439
z' and enterprise companies alike and I

00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:47,140
am also sure you never thought

00:41:44,439 --> 00:41:50,049
enterprise could be so cool because

00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:52,779
believe me it is I mean look at this but

00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:55,449
most importantly more most importantly

00:41:52,779 --> 00:41:56,829
valuable because it really does take a

00:41:55,449 --> 00:41:58,779
global team to build these growable

00:41:56,829 --> 00:42:00,489
products and we really want to enable

00:41:58,779 --> 00:42:02,229
everybody no matter where you come from

00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:04,869
no matter where you work no matter what

00:42:02,229 --> 00:42:06,910
you do but don't just take my word for

00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:09,039
it here it is - other story how

00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:11,229
Enterprise company Shopify has embraced

00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:13,869
open-source and enabled their culture

00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:16,300
with the mantra open by default our

00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:22,349
Sebastian and Christian

00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:22,349
[Applause]

00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:29,530
Thank You Dana and thank you for having

00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:31,330
us this is really exciting so my name is

00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:33,010
Christian I'm a staff developer on the

00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:34,510
payments team in Montreal and I'm

00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:37,060
Sebastian senior production engineer

00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:38,710
also Montreal so we're part of shop

00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,930
fight and for those who don't know

00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:43,810
Shopify we're ecommerce platform that

00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:46,030
allow for small medium and big merchants

00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:48,700
to sell their products across a plethora

00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:50,350
of channels and our core mission is

00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:52,800
really to make commerce better for

00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:56,110
everyone which also involves open source

00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:59,260
we're at around 4,000 employees now we

00:42:56,110 --> 00:43:02,560
have 800 thousand merchants across 175

00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:04,840
countries and we have several offices

00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:08,320
around different cities including in

00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:10,330
Berlin now trough I started in 2006 and

00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:13,450
if you really want to be that 100-year

00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:16,500
company we need to invest in our stack

00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:19,450
and a big part of our stack is rails

00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:21,940
rails being powered by Ruby we actually

00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:24,700
compete contribute to its ecosystem in

00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:27,370
fact Toby our CEO used to be a core

00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:31,960
contributor now we also have a dedicated

00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:34,330
rails core team with contributors and as

00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:37,330
much as possible we live on the cutting

00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:38,590
edge releases of rails that allows us to

00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:42,040
benefit from the latest performance

00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:44,650
enhancements features and bug fixes many

00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:46,170
of which we contributed to it also

00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:50,200
allows us to reduce the maintenance cost

00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:52,680
but most importantly Foster's success

00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:56,860
for all the community

00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:58,720
thanks well I mean as much as rails

00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:01,300
development at the core of our business

00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,160
Shopify platform is actually a full

00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:05,290
ecosystem of different technologies I

00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:07,300
mean as the company grew our needs

00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:09,520
became more specific and we needed

00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:12,100
projects that would properly tailor to

00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,660
our specific needs and after all writing

00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:16,540
code is part of the fun of solving

00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:19,060
problems excluding Forks Shopify has

00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:22,630
over 200 open-source repos that are

00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:24,370
available out there and perhaps most

00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:27,220
important interesting story of an open

00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:29,170
source is boot snap so boot Snap is a

00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:31,150
library that plugs into Ruby and

00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:32,220
optimizes and caches expensive

00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:33,900
computations

00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,660
with a focus on reducing the boot time

00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:38,849
for rails for the Shopify core platform

00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:41,340
it was able to slash the boot time in

00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:44,550
for dropping from 25 seconds to Round

00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:46,380
six I mean open source two years ago the

00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:48,450
project has received over a hundred pull

00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:51,599
requests and now it's activated by

00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:53,640
defaults in rails 5.2 powering all the

00:44:51,599 --> 00:45:00,000
million or so rails website out there

00:44:53,640 --> 00:45:02,010
I mean Shopify believes an open doesn't

00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,200
start at the publication of a project

00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:06,960
but that it's much bigger than open

00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:09,480
source internally we have a deep culture

00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,190
of the transparency the vast majority of

00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,530
us a communications are happening in

00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:16,320
public channels and in the vaults are

00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:19,020
internal wiki we're able to facilitate

00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,410
the search I call all of our shared

00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,990
knowledge

00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:24,330
I mean internal work is not about

00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:28,619
signing NDA's it's about people working

00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:31,920
together but what about the code I mean

00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:34,470
yes we use github and with very few

00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:37,290
exceptions all developers designers

00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:39,300
content creators have access to all the

00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:42,119
repositories issues in project groups

00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:43,460
teams are encouraged to create repos and

00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:46,380
share between each other

00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:48,690
github essentially allows us to bring

00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:53,070
that open-source mentality inside

00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:54,930
Shopify with zero effort in projects are

00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:57,450
generally started by individual team and

00:45:54,930 --> 00:46:00,780
over time internal communities will

00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:02,609
start forming and around technologies

00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,359
and sharing their struggles and their

00:46:02,609 --> 00:46:06,270
solutions

00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:07,770
I mean organically projects become Co

00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:09,960
maintained and they spread throughout

00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:12,359
the company eventually becoming the

00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,970
standard and recommended by default on

00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:17,609
our valve projects if and when those

00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:19,740
projects be are made public those same

00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:22,770
communities carry on and become the

00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:24,869
stewards that are public facing github

00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:29,070
helped us carry off the open philosophy

00:46:24,869 --> 00:46:30,930
throughout that development cycle but

00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:33,150
allowing the communities to flourish

00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:35,670
that much tends to multiply the number

00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:38,550
of repositories throughout its years

00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:42,089
Shopify has created over thousands of

00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:44,820
repository and having so many repos

00:46:42,089 --> 00:46:46,680
comes with some complexity

00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:49,410
the role of my team developer

00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:52,800
acceleration is to reduce that friction

00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:55,920
to automate and to standardize I mean

00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:58,380
our customers are the developers we want

00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,270
to empower them and the better we enable

00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:03,510
them the better they go on and serve

00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:05,760
their own customers so we integrate into

00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:08,340
github is API and we provide tooling for

00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,890
local development review testing

00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:12,870
production and even after production

00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:15,660
carries on and again the maintenance and

00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:17,550
that feedback loop that comes back well

00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:19,620
whether development is happening within

00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:23,310
a team across team or out of the public

00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:26,160
the platform remains the same that's a

00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:28,290
lot of investment but connecting our

00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,760
teams with the rest of the world we

00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:31,080
allow the crowdsourcing of that

00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:37,560
maintenance and the rest of the

00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:39,570
development so we've been doing open

00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:42,300
source for many years and I wish we had

00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:46,620
developer acceleration a decade ago so

00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:49,470
about around 2008 2012 we released two

00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:51,060
open-source libraries under a sister

00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:54,060
getup organization called active

00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:57,630
merchants and the goal of those

00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:59,220
libraries were a means of quickly

00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:02,190
expanding the payments accepted by our

00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:04,140
merchants in new markets and at the time

00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:06,870
it was the easiest way we knew of for

00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:09,780
expansion so let me explain a bit the

00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:10,950
woodwork is partners would write their

00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,840
own implementation of those libraries

00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:15,930
those libraries would have just simple

00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,560
abstractions they'd open up a PR we'd

00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:19,050
review it

00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:21,450
then merge it back and that would save

00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:23,100
us from writing all the code then we'd

00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:25,140
simply bump the version of

00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,910
activemerchant inside of our platform

00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:30,180
and merchants would instantly have

00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:31,920
access to many more payment aid ways so

00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:34,110
in that sense we ended up in a very

00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,750
interesting client provider relationship

00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:38,520
we not only provided the platform but we

00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:40,800
provided an SDK to work with the

00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:43,260
platform and this beneficial two-way

00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,060
street of collaboration about growth not

00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:47,900
only for shop fire but for payment

00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:51,090
gateways to be included on shop fire and

00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:53,190
then being that it's open source it

00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:55,560
doesn't stop there right we also have a

00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:56,740
co maintainer Spradley who uses the

00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:01,600
libraries in production as well

00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:03,310
and this is only one example of ours so

00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,900
investing an open-source means different

00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:06,180
things obviously different things for

00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:09,310
different companies of different stages

00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:11,619
but if done correctly applying the open

00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:14,380
principles to various communities be it

00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:17,230
internal or external blurs the lines and

00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:19,869
makes them interconnected having an open

00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:28,770
mindset is beneficial to everyone thank

00:49:19,869 --> 00:49:31,330
you all right Thank You Sebastian

00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:33,970
Christian Thank You Dana

00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:36,040
shanku and grey we're so excited to have

00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:37,900
the Shopify team here and hear from them

00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:40,180
that it really is possible you really

00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:42,640
can build the team on this open by

00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:45,760
default type of practice so we're really

00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,720
excited in that now we're coming to the

00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,580
last section

00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:52,000
and I'm super excited to talk to you

00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:54,850
about what's next this year we've had

00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,310
hundreds of conversations with maintain

00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:59,170
errs and open source contributors and I

00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:00,550
actually have a practice that I'm really

00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:02,800
loving right now which is I personally

00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:04,869
spend a couple of hours every Friday

00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,850
having video calls with maintainer zuv

00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:09,010
big open source projects and small open

00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:11,320
source projects some of you I've talked

00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:13,450
to on fridays before it's become one of

00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:15,490
the favorite parts of my week for me and

00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:16,690
it's also been in combination with

00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:19,240
everything else we're doing a really

00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:20,230
great way for us to learn from you about

00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:22,359
the challenges and the opportunities

00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:24,040
that you have in the open source world

00:50:22,359 --> 00:50:26,680
and how github can serve you better and

00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:28,750
so we have some pretty exciting news to

00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:32,880
unveil today and to tell you more please

00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:32,880
welcome Devin's oogle Devon

00:50:34,709 --> 00:50:37,709
see

00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:45,830
thanks NAT hi I'm Devin and I'm the

00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:49,070
product manager of the open source

00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:51,170
economy team here at github our work is

00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:53,150
focused on maintainer x' and building

00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:57,200
tools for the open source community to

00:50:53,150 --> 00:51:00,800
thrive as NAT showed earlier we're all

00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:03,530
connected the world runs on open source

00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:06,140
none of it would be possible without the

00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:09,320
global team of maintainer x' developers

00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:11,570
designers researchers writers and more

00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:14,870
who devote their time to pushing

00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:17,750
technology forward like the scientists

00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:20,540
on stage earlier today each of us builds

00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:24,230
on the work of others and each of the

00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:26,330
developers we depend on has a story let

00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:27,950
me introduce you to a few open-source

00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:31,370
maintainer x' who's built software that

00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:34,250
you've likely used yourself meat

00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:36,770
mariotta she's a Python core developer

00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:38,660
from Vancouver and she has a ritual of

00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:42,890
taking an ice cream selfie after each

00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:43,310
conference talk she gives and here's

00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:46,310
fattie

00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:49,820
he's from Ankara Turkey and he's the

00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:52,100
creator of MgO thottie works from home

00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:53,780
so when he needs a break he gets to play

00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:57,800
with his adorable son Alper

00:51:53,780 --> 00:52:00,470
and meet Henry who's based in New York

00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:04,010
City and left his job last year to work

00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:06,140
on open source full-time Henry is the

00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:09,340
maintainer of Babel which is an NPM

00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:12,290
package that we use here at github

00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:15,530
it's these developers that make the

00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:17,840
github community what it is the strength

00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:20,060
of this connected community depends on

00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:24,080
the continued success of developers just

00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:26,780
like mariotta sahti and Henry and at

00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:29,630
github this is the core of what we're

00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:33,470
about we're here to support the humans

00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:35,690
behind human progress in that spirit

00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:39,920
were thrilled to announce a brand new

00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:41,630
feature of github I'm so excited to

00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,060
share that today we're launching the

00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:46,220
beta of github sponsors a new way to

00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:48,700
financially support the developers you

00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:48,700
depend on

00:52:59,729 --> 00:53:06,159
I'm really excited to this is the first

00:53:03,879 --> 00:53:07,599
step the the purpose of this beta is to

00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:10,059
get your feedback and we're really

00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:12,489
excited to hear from you so I bet you're

00:53:10,059 --> 00:53:16,779
just as excited as I am so let's see how

00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:18,939
it works to start let's sponsor mariotta

00:53:16,779 --> 00:53:20,919
we'll head to her github profile and

00:53:18,939 --> 00:53:24,519
you'll see there's a new sponsor button

00:53:20,919 --> 00:53:26,559
right on her profile I'm a huge space

00:53:24,519 --> 00:53:28,599
nerd so I think it's awesome that her

00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:31,599
contributions to Python played a role in

00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:33,489
creating the black hole image when I see

00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:36,459
that button I'm super excited that I can

00:53:33,489 --> 00:53:39,039
now show her my support clicking it

00:53:36,459 --> 00:53:40,629
takes me to her sponsorship page here

00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:44,429
she gets to decide how to represent

00:53:40,629 --> 00:53:46,479
herself and how you can best support her

00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:48,759
now let's see this from maryadas

00:53:46,479 --> 00:53:50,799
perspective when she goes to my profile

00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:52,929
or when she sees my profile hovercard

00:53:50,799 --> 00:53:55,539
she will see a new call-out that says

00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:59,199
your sponsor so she knows I'm invested

00:53:55,539 --> 00:54:01,059
in her work we've also built this into

00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:03,119
existing github workflows so that it's

00:54:01,059 --> 00:54:05,469
seamless to support developers I'm

00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,239
really excited about this because it'll

00:54:05,469 --> 00:54:09,339
surface developers that you can sponsor

00:54:07,239 --> 00:54:11,829
directly from the conversations where

00:54:09,339 --> 00:54:14,049
you collaborate with them for instance

00:54:11,829 --> 00:54:16,229
perhaps Patti has been really helpful as

00:54:14,049 --> 00:54:18,969
I make my contributions to Van Gogh

00:54:16,229 --> 00:54:20,589
imagine I've merged my first PR into the

00:54:18,969 --> 00:54:23,289
project and I want to thank him for all

00:54:20,589 --> 00:54:25,089
his help I can jump straight into the

00:54:23,289 --> 00:54:28,959
sponsorship page from the hover card on

00:54:25,089 --> 00:54:31,989
the PR but maybe you want to support a

00:54:28,959 --> 00:54:33,759
project not a person to do that

00:54:31,989 --> 00:54:36,369
we've also added support for a new file

00:54:33,759 --> 00:54:37,899
called funding gamal that makes it easy

00:54:36,369 --> 00:54:41,139
to support the project however the

00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:43,269
maintainer is see fit when funding amel

00:54:41,139 --> 00:54:45,819
is added to a projects master Bank

00:54:43,269 --> 00:54:48,369
branch a new sponsor button will appear

00:54:45,819 --> 00:54:50,319
at the top of the repo clicking the

00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:54,489
button opens a natively rendered view of

00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:56,199
the funding links listed in that file it

00:54:54,489 --> 00:54:57,939
can showcase the sponsor the 'get of

00:54:56,199 --> 00:55:00,309
sponsors profiles of the developers who

00:54:57,939 --> 00:55:01,899
contribute to the project or it can also

00:55:00,309 --> 00:55:04,599
link to other popular funding models

00:55:01,899 --> 00:55:10,179
including open collective community

00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:11,050
bridge tide lifts and more open source

00:55:10,179 --> 00:55:14,050
is

00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:15,940
the heart of github the developers who

00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:18,310
build our shared digital infrastructure

00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:20,860
are what make this community so strong

00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:23,410
as a thank you for these valuable

00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:25,840
contributions github sponsors charges

00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:29,220
zero platform fees when you support the

00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:29,220
work of other developers

00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:42,380
we will also cover payment processing

00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:45,470
costs for the first 12 months of the

00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:47,660
program to celebrate the launch 100% of

00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:52,370
your sponsorship goes directly to the

00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:54,560
developer github sponsors also supports

00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:57,680
payouts in all around the world in every

00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:58,850
country where github does business over

00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,530
the course of the summer we're excited

00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:01,180
to be working with strength to scale up

00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:04,360
this beta

00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:06,350
we're all part of a global software team

00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:08,810
expanding opportunities to participate

00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:11,000
on that team is at the core of our

00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:15,130
mission so we are proud to make this

00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,130
tool available to developers worldwide

00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:20,300
finally many contributions that are

00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:22,970
crucial to a well-functioning project

00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:25,460
don't show up in code review github

00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:27,080
sponsors is built for funding all types

00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:31,430

00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:32,840
software anyone who contributes to open

00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:36,140
source whether through code

00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:39,860
documentation leadership mentorship

00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:41,240
design technical writing I could spend

00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:43,220
the rest of this keynote listing things

00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:44,750
that go into an open source project all

00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:49,760
of those people are eligible for

00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:51,640
sponsorship github sponsors is one more

00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,960
way to contribute to open source

00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:57,290
financially supporting the people who

00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:59,750
build and maintain it starting today any

00:56:57,290 --> 00:57:02,360
github user can sponsor an open source

00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:03,800
developer in the beta if you're

00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:06,290
interested in getting sponsored for your

00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:10,190
own work you can apply at github comm

00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:13,220
slash sponsors we're launching small and

00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:15,080
simple but our mission is fast to expand

00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:18,260
opportunities to participate in and

00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:19,670
build on open-source we're here to serve

00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:21,110
the developer community and we're

00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:22,670
eagerly listening for your input for

00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:25,190
what you'd like to see and get up

00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:28,130
sponsors we're really excited to hear

00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:32,899
from you Thanks and back to you net

00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:32,899
[Applause]

00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:40,410
Thank You Devin we are so excited about

00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,930
the launch of github sponsors and this

00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:45,120
new mechanism for supporting independent

00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:46,680
developers directly on github and we're

00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:48,600
equally excited to hear your feedback

00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:50,670
and learn how we can improve this

00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,270
program so please let us know what you

00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:53,370
think now

00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:55,920
Devin mentioned that one of the great

00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:57,810
features of github sponsors is that we

00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,700
cover all of your payment processing

00:57:57,810 --> 00:58:01,590
fees for the first year and that there

00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:03,930
are no platform fees so that a hundred

00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:06,240
percent of your contribution goes

00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:09,030
directly to the developer that you

00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:10,620
sponsor and a hundred percent is amazing

00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:12,360
but we were thinking about it and we

00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:14,970
realized that what's better than a

00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:17,370
hundred percent is two hundred percent

00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:19,470
so with today's announcement we've also

00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:21,590
created the github sponsors matching

00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:23,760
fund where we will double your

00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:26,030
contribution to developers for the first

00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,030
year

00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:39,750
this enables us to really jumpstart the

00:58:37,319 --> 00:58:41,700
github sponsors program and boost the

00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:43,559
contributions that you make while still

00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:45,720
giving you the empowerment and the

00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:47,640
freedom to choose who in the open-source

00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:50,160
community you want to support so we're

00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:52,200
really excited about this okay we

00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:54,630
covered a lot of ground today so let's

00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,819
just step back and do a brief recap

00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:58,680
shanku talk to you about some of the new

00:58:56,819 --> 00:59:00,839
security features that we've released

00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:03,510
including maintainer security advisories

00:59:00,839 --> 00:59:05,460
security policies and together with gray

00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:07,349
the acquisition of depend bot which

00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:09,150
we're really excited about we've been

00:59:07,349 --> 00:59:10,790
saying internally the depend bot is a

00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:13,109
little bit like a Roomba for your code

00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:15,540
and it comes out and cleans it up for

00:59:13,109 --> 00:59:17,220
you and then Dana showed you some new

00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:20,160
capabilities for enterprises from

00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:22,440
enterprise accounts to internal repos to

00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:24,059
new roles the triage and maintained role

00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:25,470
which will be really useful for open

00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:27,690
source communities as well and

00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:29,520
permissions and the organizational

00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:31,559
insights and then we heard from Kristian

00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:33,839
and Sebastian at Shopify about the best

00:59:31,559 --> 00:59:35,910
practices that they are using and then

00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:38,089
Devin showed you github sponsors and we

00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:41,069
talked about the sponsors matching fund

00:59:38,089 --> 00:59:42,960
additionally just two weeks ago we

00:59:41,069 --> 00:59:44,940
announced the github package registry

00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,099
which gives you a single place to store

00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:50,309
your code and your packages behind a

00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:52,890
single login and then coming up later

00:59:50,309 --> 00:59:55,920
the summer we will have some more news

00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:57,839
to share about github actions as I

00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,730
mentioned before at github our mission

00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:02,190
is to build the global platform for

00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:04,740
developer collaboration and that really

01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:06,780
means that our job is to serve you right

01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:09,119
to make your life easier to make you

01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:10,890
more productive to help you connect to

01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:13,109
the developers and contributors who make

01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:14,460
your work possible so thank you for

01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:16,109
joining us this morning we hope you

01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:16,350
enjoy the rest of the conference thanks

01:00:16,109 --> 01:00:21,780
so much

01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:30,780
