00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:17,230
well I promise this is going to be a

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,180
weird very very weird talk this is all I

00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:22,529
can promise

00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:28,599
I guess you've never seen a midwife add

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:31,750
a stage at github and that's what I do

00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:34,260
I'm tech Midwife what I do is that I

00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:38,500
help people I work with

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:41,140
deliver what they're great about I help

00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:44,199

00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:47,979
deliver something beautiful safe and

00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:50,909
healthy so I'm Charlene Rene I'm a head

00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:54,670
of the digital communities and

00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:57,360
communication at ng digital and what I

00:00:54,670 --> 00:01:02,140
can tell you is that I've never never

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:05,199
opened a repo on github never did I

00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:11,110
never touched a line of code ever in my

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:14,110
life I knew nothing about API data Alexa

00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:17,740
this that two years ago I knew nothing

00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:21,010
about this so I told you that I work for

00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:25,000
this company Angie not sure you know

00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:30,250
what it is it's a company French company

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,620
that helps the planet to be greener we

00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,630
did not always do that we were part of

00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,240
the problem back then but now we're

00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:40,830
trying to be part of the solution and ng

00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:43,540
digital we helped a group provide

00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:47,740
software digital software that will help

00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:50,800
us towards zero carbon transition so

00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:55,750
this is what we do pretty much and we do

00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:59,560
smart CDs we do smart home we do wind

00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:02,740
and solar monitoring and what I can tell

00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:06,640
you is that when I got there two years

00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:09,700
ago in Paris I was in Bangkok I was

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,190
working for the asia-pacific region and

00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:15,489
it's only all Charlene please you know

00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:16,540
take this job of community manager and I

00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:18,249
was like yeah cool

00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,110
I'm gonna do some communication about

00:02:18,249 --> 00:02:23,020
great people I will learn about

00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:26,050
no the IT stuff I will and when I got

00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:28,240
there what happened is my former boss

00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,470
told me he said you're not gonna do

00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,990
really communication

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:34,480
I mean community management you're not

00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:37,330
gonna have social media you're not gonna

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,480
do this it's like a you know I signed

00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:44,020
that contract already but um he told me

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:49,750
what you're gonna have to do is help the

00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:52,480
ng digital factory work meaning you will

00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:55,420
help business people on one side and

00:02:52,480 --> 00:03:00,330
take people on the other side to work

00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:05,410
together because they don't know how ok

00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:08,860
so it looked pretty much like this to me

00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:13,750
it looked pretty much like the Battle of

00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:17,610
the bastards this guy was a digital team

00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:20,620
could be anyone an API guy data

00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,810
designers architects and it pretty much

00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,480
looked like this is this guy on his own

00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:28,810
or girl this guy on his own with a great

00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:33,040
tool he has a wonderful wonderful how do

00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:35,320
you call this this war thank you great

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,299
one could kill a dragon with it but

00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:42,519
doesn't know yet and the other guy

00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:46,180
business and management rushing to this

00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:50,799
guy all alone and to me it was quite

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:53,830
impressive to see this I had no idea of

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,410
what a digital factory should be about I

00:03:53,830 --> 00:04:00,760
didn't know much and actually not

00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:05,070
knowing much about tech helped me seeing

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:08,140
this because I didn't have a side then I

00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:10,870
guess I had to choose at one point but I

00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:13,000
come from a company and I do believe

00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:16,660
that it could happen to you too is that

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,150
you have this digital guy on one side he

00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,880
has no idea what the product should look

00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:24,729
like he has no idea what a strategy is

00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,710
gonna take him he just knows at one

00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:28,840
point

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:31,780
business and management will rush to him

00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,960
and say help me deliver now

00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:39,970
to me this it doesn't sound either fair

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:44,350
and smart either so what we did pretty

00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:49,390
much is what I looked at is this really

00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:51,430
sad you know Muppet it was really really

00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:54,370
sad to look at them I worked with them

00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,650
actually I wasn't on the same floor for

00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,210
whatever reason but I just like them at

00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,850
just like the tech people in the tech

00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,950
team and I saw this guy rationing to

00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:07,150
them and help me deliver I tell you know

00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:09,130
it just got messy and what I noticed is

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:13,870
that the tech team felt really

00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:17,830
disengaged within their the life of the

00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:20,200
company they felt really set aside when

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:24,400
we looked at the strategy the product

00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:26,350
strategy and at one point what happened

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,350
is that they didn't carry the brand

00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:32,110
outside of the company they didn't carry

00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:36,790
what we were great at they were just

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:40,240
waiting to be pretty much hammered by

00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:42,640
business and top management so what I

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,240
had to do and I believed that it was the

00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:50,850
best decision we ever made is turn this

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:54,580
sad little Muppet into fierce dragon

00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:56,170
this is a non-spoiler other ginger man

00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,460
because there's someone behind it and if

00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,350
you have a look at the last season I

00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:05,170
don't want you to be spoiled so here it

00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:08,290
is so I wanted just to turn these people

00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:12,340
into beautiful dragon beautiful dragon

00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:15,430
fears that could be the face of the

00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:18,730
strategy of energy digital that was my

00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:20,290
goal I had no management back then long

00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,470
story short we had no management for a

00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:26,380
little while so let's try it

00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:30,310
so that's what we did what I had to do

00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:34,840
is pretty much to tell them that it was

00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:38,290
ok to talk about what they did that it

00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:40,750
was okay to stand up to management to

00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:43,210
stand up to business people and say you

00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,220
doing this wrong or you should do this

00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:49,570
or let me tell you this

00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:52,210
so this is what my job was all about so

00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:55,270
it took a little time just making sure

00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:58,900
that I understood what they were doing

00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:01,630
already that I understood what could be

00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:04,300
beneficial to the company what could be

00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:09,040
beneficial to us being a software

00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:12,580
company it took me a while but they

00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:15,970
didn't felt comfortable you know taking

00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:17,230
a seat at the table and also I want to

00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:20,470
tell you this this is a French company

00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:23,590
so we're not really used to you know

00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:27,730
taking the Mike French culture is really

00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:30,850
much like that and on my side you know

00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:33,190
they didn't feel comfortable but on the

00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:36,040
other side business people were just you

00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:39,520
know going their own way most of the

00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:43,330
time they did not even come to us to the

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:46,960
tech teams they would go to external

00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:50,280
agencies it felt terrible

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:54,250
I mean we see this as you had capable

00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:57,130
experts on grounds that were not being

00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:00,280
involved into the strategy in the

00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:02,890
product so it felt really wrong so we

00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,140
had to do something and my goal was to

00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:07,690
unboard these people turn them into

00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:11,410
dragons and I had to tell them something

00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:15,370
is and we talked about this a whole lot

00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:19,090
you guys have an expertise you have

00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:22,630
missing half of your job there you're

00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:26,010
missing communication about what you do

00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:32,160
best communication that word to them

00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:34,660
felt either wrong or knowing or fake

00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:37,960
most of the time that was true this is

00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:41,140
how corporate communication work into

00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,930
either big groups as this company as ng

00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:46,390
digital or ng I had to tell them and it

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:49,570
was my job to do so to tell them listen

00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:51,700
you're doing great but 50% of your job

00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,250
you're missing out you're missing out

00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,310
because nobody knows what you're doing

00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:59,610
we feel I mean if we look

00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:01,860
as a black box they don't know about you

00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,840
they don't know what you do and they're

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:07,260
not going to come back to you you don't

00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,300
you just can't sit sit and wait for them

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,120
to come to to you it's not possible

00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,660
anymore so he took a little time it's

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,029
what we call change management but

00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:22,040
that's what I call one-on-one and Trust

00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:24,990
and making them comfortable enough to

00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:28,080
trust me I didn't want them to feel

00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:30,690
embarrassed or feel awkward it was just

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,600
an opportunity for them to show what

00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:39,450
they are doing at best so I'm gonna show

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:41,970
you one example that I have and it's

00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:44,339
about the tooling team giant vase in the

00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:47,310
in the room right now I don't know where

00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:50,339
is he he's right here and I worked with

00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:52,170
him and people from his team to say

00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,589
listen we're gonna look at your problems

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:58,680
and we're gonna try to find a solution

00:09:54,589 --> 00:10:02,280
because again doing great work is not

00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:05,490
enough so let's take a look at the

00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,650
tooling team's problem pretty much it

00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:10,290
looked like this

00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:13,680
don't focus on this focus on this one

00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:17,130
it looks to me when Joey was telling me

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,410
about this that we had wonderful tooling

00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,400
sweet it was like a beautiful tech

00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,290
Corvette

00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,170
that did not go out of the garage much

00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:29,400
you know it's really strong it's

00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:30,870
beautiful it's doing the work but no

00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,900
one's really much on it yet

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,520
no one's understand how it works and on

00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,280
top of that we worked with great people

00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:43,010
but we're not there yet

00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:47,730
adoption slow also the ng group is

00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:52,050
scattered we I was in this region back

00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:57,120
then Asia Pacific we go up to you North

00:10:52,050 --> 00:11:00,420
America South America China and everyone

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:04,209
has this little world is little local IT

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,949
is little local digital strategy and

00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:08,980
one is doing everybody's doing something

00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:12,040
on its own and when you want to be a

00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,839
software company and when you do you

00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,269
know when you want to do something

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,809
better when you want to industrialize

00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:22,179
when you want to scale up you can't have

00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:24,699
like a thousand projects doing the

00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:27,759
little life on their own you have to

00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:30,759
find a way first find the tools that

00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:33,689
will help you share and collaborate but

00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:36,819
then have the right mindset to it so

00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:39,189
here different culture didn't feel like

00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:43,119
sharing much everyone's doing his thing

00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:45,879
on his own ownership of the code as well

00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:48,129
was an issue and there's also the stress

00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:51,819
to be reviewed like peer review was not

00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:55,179
something that was in the game yet so we

00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:59,619
had to help them on this so problem the

00:11:55,179 --> 00:12:00,129
world is scattered also no one knows

00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:03,459
about it

00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:05,889
about us we have we have no candidates

00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:07,869
that knocking on the door saying I want

00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:10,990
to work for you because I believe that

00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:16,029
energy digital is great so really having

00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:18,999
an issue with employee branding it's

00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:20,920
really how to show how can you be

00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:24,009
differentiating when you have a great

00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:27,269
tool but again not enough to be

00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:30,490
different from Google Facebook whatever

00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:34,149
how can you show your own DNA your own

00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:38,049
personality so again third problem we're

00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:43,360
not visible we're not attractive so what

00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:46,569
I try to do with the team is not spend a

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:50,319
lot of time on the tool they spend much

00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:52,990
more time on the people and I people I

00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:56,730
mean we have fantastic passion driven

00:12:52,990 --> 00:13:00,339
people at energy digital and we have fun

00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:03,189
and and sometimes they get out of

00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:04,629
costume just to do something else knows

00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:05,999
you're actually having fun with the

00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:09,249
passion but I tell you more about this

00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:12,879
my work was to they are my first

00:13:09,249 --> 00:13:15,790
resource they're my first topic that's

00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,220
this this is what I do this is what I

00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,410
tend to do there

00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,899
first audiences than my first client

00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:24,079
they are my everything because I don't

00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:27,180
know much about the tool and again

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:32,180
adoption on the tool not always easy so

00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:37,439
let's focus on them why we did is say ok

00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:40,069
we have a couple field of expertise we

00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:42,449
understand that the business has needs

00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:46,550
so what I had to do is listen to

00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:51,029
business outside of ng digital saying eh

00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:53,550
what does your strategy looks like what

00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:55,410
kind of experts are you missing and on

00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,100
the other side I had to say to these

00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,589
guys

00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,810
business is waiting for you to help them

00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:06,449
with a strategy so what we did is we

00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:09,810
launched a tribe activity it started out

00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:12,300
at first with a visual identity and we

00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:14,069
had fun with it we really did because

00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:17,220
again you're looking at someone that

00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:19,920
works and I'm not even exaggerating it

00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:22,500
was like mr. robot there I mean it was

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,439
like mr. robot on his own you know it

00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:28,379
was such a gloomy gloomy flow we worked

00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:32,279
on it felt miserable a little bit so we

00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:35,910
had to give them an identity give them a

00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:40,019
face I given them a way to collaborate

00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:43,139
and feel at home so this we have five

00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:45,439
tribes today could be eight tomorrow it

00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:49,889
could be three the day after tomorrow

00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:52,350
these are the technical these are the

00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:56,459
expertise that we carry so we have API

00:14:52,350 --> 00:15:00,329
in a source design customer interfaces

00:14:56,459 --> 00:15:02,309
and architecture for clouds so they

00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:04,230
picked their own animal they picked

00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:06,930
their own color they picked their own

00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:10,470
names but they also picked their own

00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:12,870
roadmap what do I want to do now that I

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:16,170
have the mic now that people are waiting

00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:19,110
for me now that people understand pretty

00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:20,550
much what I do what is my road map so

00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,920
again

00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:26,759
back then they were waiting for people

00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:30,870
to come to them now we like pushing them

00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:36,270
putting men in position of aiming at

00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:38,940
business again three goals and these are

00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:41,490
for all tribes what we want to do is

00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:44,310
first skill up and it's what we've been

00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:46,650
doing a whole lot make sure that their

00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:49,529
field of expertise is a field of

00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:52,260
knowledge for everyone in the group and

00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:55,320
when I say everyone I mean it's a huge

00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,930
group it's huge it's a hundred and fifty

00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,480
thousand people throughout 24 countries

00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:02,730
we cannot tell get everyone there's no

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,370
need to target everyone but we want to

00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:08,790
target people that actually building

00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:12,810
sense to you know energy software of

00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:14,580
tomorrow so skill ups you know make your

00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:18,870
expertise of field of knowledge for

00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:20,730
everyone the second one was entry

00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,920
digital has a great position because we

00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:25,430
can see what's happening within all to

00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:28,320
be used throughout the world so we like

00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:30,810
Australia working with Chad North

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,839
America is working on the one okay why

00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:37,740
don't we do something together so we're

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:40,580
using a position to help them get a

00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:45,690
bigger picture and from a little project

00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:51,600
scale up and finally speak up are we

00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:54,600
trying to go outside of Mg digital we

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,180
want to be visible and we know that

00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,760
we're really really far from the sexy

00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,380
list we know this but we're trying to

00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,839
connect you as much so I'll tell you

00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:07,559
through this how does it work how do we

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:11,900
do what we do is that for scale up for

00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:15,660
the first goal we target each tribe has

00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:18,420
a set of targets so let's say they've

00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,660
got um you know a target that ABC

00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:23,600
business unit I want these guys to

00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:26,640
understand what I do because I believe

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:30,450
that the strategy would be better better

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:34,100
and efficient if they have me with the

00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:38,780
team so scale-up works with workshops

00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:41,760
for example the design tribe will do

00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:43,289
they do something nothing is really cool

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,370
they will take you throughout the day

00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:49,350
and show you what service design is and

00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:53,730
how can you adapt it to your strategy

00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:55,860
and to your roadmap again we don't work

00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:58,710
with ng digital people we work with

00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:00,899
people that have no idea what design is

00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:03,210
they have no they're not tag people

00:18:00,899 --> 00:18:05,880
again they're business people there are

00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:07,620
business people that can rely from my

00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,820
expertise and these are the people we

00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:14,970
target API we want to we're gonna have a

00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:16,710
full workshop on the API economy because

00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:19,470
we believe that these B was missing out

00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:23,070
on something so there's a lot of work on

00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:25,139
targeting people and inner source and

00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:28,080
this is the one I'm talking to you about

00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:31,320
his we did a meet up with other

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,389
companies and show how we can provide an

00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,830
inner source environment and how we can

00:18:33,389 --> 00:18:37,710
leverage from this tool that we call

00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:41,250
data community management is obviously

00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:43,409
helping a whole lot we have internal

00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,630
channels and so on and what we do and

00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:47,789
you're looking at content that we

00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:50,549
provide as well we try to have thought

00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:52,710
leaders coming in as trusted like you

00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:56,220
know king lane for example for the API

00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:58,980
tribe I had no idea was what in ng was

00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:01,710
all about but it was really really cool

00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:04,110
to see that a lot of people came because

00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:06,840
they knew king lane and they knew that

00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,519
he could have right I mean in

00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:13,380
interaction with him so we try to

00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:16,830
provide the best for them scale up again

00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:20,370
saying that we have a great view of what

00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:22,620
is happening digital wise so our goal is

00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:25,380
to to have a platform we have this

00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:28,370
platform is called digit place and it

00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:31,820
targets two audiences to persona

00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:36,090
business people and and developers

00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:39,690
showing every digital project built up

00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:42,080
within ng in the group for example North

00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:44,760
America is starting at a chatbot project

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,529
we don't want them to go outside of ng

00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,970
and you know look for a company that

00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:50,340
would do something quick and dirty for

00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:53,340
them they're gonna go into the platform

00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:55,530
and check what has been done

00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:58,770
so they will look businesspeople will

00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:01,500
look at the use cases a demo what kind

00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:05,040
of clients are they targeting designers

00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:07,110
will have the help of the design system

00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:11,030
they can pretty much copy/paste what has

00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:14,700
been done for the front and developers

00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:17,429
have access to the repo on github so

00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:21,179
this is an internal internal platform

00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:25,200
that my team is building it's kind of

00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:27,240
cool because you understand that people

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,330
are really looking for what what is

00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,919
happening within the group and it just

00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,380
makes sense to them they don't want to

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,780
reinvent the wheel every day they want

00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:39,840
to use what has been done already so

00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:43,260
again one of the goal of the inner

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:48,240
source tribe is to promote reuse and

00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:53,070
finally speak up we had no communication

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:55,980
two years ago about ng digital actually

00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:59,790
I had my boss told me not to do any

00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:03,600
communication outside of the group but

00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:05,490
now the tribes actually were so excited

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,470
the tribal leaders were so excited about

00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,790
it that they wanted to show what they

00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,740
were doing they wanted to show that

00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:15,120
progress they wanted to show that they

00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:17,790
solved issues that you know them work in

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,740
different formats so we use LinkedIn

00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:22,500
tomorrow we can use something else it

00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:26,190
doesn't matter but again is giving them

00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:28,590
my job and my team's job is to help them

00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:31,950
create content that will target the

00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:36,360
audiences and build a better network for

00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:39,059
them also we give talks as much as

00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:43,380
possible and participate into conference

00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:47,880
as this one today so now we will just

00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:50,700
endure how what is done sometimes it

00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:53,520
doesn't work at all sometimes it does

00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,919
and it's a huge surprise but there's no

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,770
winning recipe really it's just making

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:02,520
sure that we connect the business people

00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:04,050
and detect people and again it sounds

00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,380
really obvious to you

00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:11,670
but to us ng digital and I believe other

00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:16,830
companies it's it's a an old model of

00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:19,350
business first and tech will follow what

00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:21,720
we're trying to promote here it's a

00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:26,040
different culture as saying we believe

00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:28,370
that value is within the tech and that

00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:31,350
our tech people shouldn't be you know

00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:35,790
focusing on delivery but actually giving

00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:38,880
insights giving ideas and promoting a

00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:41,580
strategy these guys and girls are really

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:45,330
do people we want to leverage from so

00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:47,340
what did we win after a few months with

00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:50,460
the inner source tribe so the tooling

00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:52,350
team became the inner source tribe with

00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,929
his own little squirrel with his own

00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:58,050
little identity they actually loved it

00:22:54,929 --> 00:22:58,500
and I think it's great what does it look

00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:01,830
like

00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:06,330
so adoption as I told you was really low

00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:09,420
in a few months we multiplied this by by

00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:12,380
three again for the pushes and repo

00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:15,690
saying that people came in our platform

00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:18,809
they worked on what we've been building

00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:22,260
the covet is finally out of the garage

00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:25,940
and we driving it and it shows that

00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:28,500
actually their honor in this activity so

00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:31,350
if we're still there I mean we still

00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:34,650
have to you know get better and better

00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:38,550
and better at this but it's it's great

00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:41,429
improvement to us then it looks like

00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:44,610
after a few months the whole tooling

00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:47,340
suite has been you know all adoption has

00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:50,640
been raised up and what we've been doing

00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:55,230
with workshop and webinars and online

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:58,710
sessions and one-to-one workshops I look

00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:01,080
like it really helped us as praising out

00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:03,540
what we were doing in terms of tooling

00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:05,850
but also in terms of mindset people

00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:10,620
actually using it understanding it and

00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:12,270
it looks like this today this two years

00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:15,090
ago did not happen

00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:17,730
we use business unit throughout the

00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:20,580
world did not share anything they were

00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:23,880
the owner of their own products the

00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:26,460
owner of their own coat they were doing

00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:29,490
the things on their own and management

00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:31,670
told them keep it that way it's fine it

00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:34,410
does do manner I mean don't worry about

00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:37,050
peer review don't worry about your code

00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:40,070
it doesn't matter because it won't get

00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:43,140
out of our business unit of our country

00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:46,470
now we have no choice if we want to make

00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:49,770
small software we have not chose to rely

00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:52,320
on others people intelligence on other

00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:55,290
peoples and colleagues projects and

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,809
successes so today it looks like this

00:24:55,290 --> 00:25:01,380
and to our managers sometimes this

00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:03,179
scares them a whole lot because you know

00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:06,690
the gate worried what has been shared

00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:08,309
within be use are we sure we're not

00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:11,309
spreading out something that should be

00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:14,730
you know that should stay with us but

00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:16,970
some I mean now managers have no no way

00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:21,120
around it they have to follow the

00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:24,510
mindset the culture that we've built and

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:27,720
also we are teaming up with other

00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:31,280
companies that a few of them are here

00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:35,120
French fauna may be international later

00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:37,679
but two years ago no one knew about us

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,270
we didn't know what was happening with

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,520
other companies we didn't know that we

00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:43,800
had the same problems as these companies

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,760
and now we're actually trying to build

00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:50,309
something trying to build connection a

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:54,000
network of people facing the same

00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:56,580
problem yes we use github yes we're not

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,250
there yet in terms of mindset and

00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:01,500
culture in terms of adoption so we're

00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:05,429
like spreading the tips here and there

00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:07,590
sharing an experience and this is so

00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:10,710
valuable to us and this is why if you

00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:12,809
have if a company is here and has ways

00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:14,340
of doing it better I'm really looking

00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:17,280
forward to it

00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:18,380
and now we have also more people that

00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,480
are coming in

00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:24,030
finally candidates we had so many

00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,640
positions open that stayed open for a

00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:27,860
while

00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,440
and now we have people that heard from

00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:33,440
us didn't heard from us through our

00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:36,170
culprit communication through our HR

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,500
communication they heard from people

00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:41,780
they trust within the network within the

00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:44,930
tech network within the professional

00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:48,230
network so we really leverage on this

00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:50,510
ambassadors and we have more now people

00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:53,390
coming in but we still have so much to

00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:56,720
do this is where we have always still

00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:58,310
positions are open when Paris in the

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,830
same street as Google I don't know if

want you to live with is take people

is personal branding better connection

conference why don't you help us doing

00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:54,410

00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:56,720
see how we're building networks and how

00:27:54,410 --> 00:28:00,740
we actually getting smarter every day

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:03,440
thanks to all new connections to

00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:07,310
communication and marketing team people

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:10,010
like me I would say invest time in your

00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,840
ambassadors take the time to understand

00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:14,840
their needs

00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:17,600
sit back just take a look understand how

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:21,530
these people there are gems and they

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:24,260
really need to be put up front there's

00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:26,900
something that I think is awful is

00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,310
trying to get content for somebody when

00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,140
you don't understand what they're doing

00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:32,270
and I'm talking to communication

00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:34,790
marketing people here if you don't

00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:35,950
understand why your guy is doing then

00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:39,310
it's gonna be same

00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:40,000
communication is gonna look awful don't

00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:42,340
do this

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,540
spend time with them understand what

00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:47,950
they do understand with a passion is and

00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:50,380
understand how you can help them enhance

00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:52,990
their experience you will get more

00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:55,930
meaningful content and you will be

00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:59,620
leaner you will do less but you will do

00:28:55,930 --> 00:29:01,810
better management and I'm talking to my

00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:04,870
boss here I'm talking to my boss's boss

00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:08,880
I'm talking to everybody's boss sponsor

00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:12,610
and let go don't look for the KPI

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:16,000
quit it with the dashboard just quit it

00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:18,790
and let it go just let it go trust your

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,430
people and this is something that needs

00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:23,470
to be done now trust the intelligence of

00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:27,070
the people you have been hiring for so

00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:29,290
long and you know put aside a KPI trust

00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:31,600
them they are intelligent they are smart

00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:33,010
people you should follow them this is

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,690
what you should do this why I've been

00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,230
synched to my boss every day it works

00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,570
great

00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:41,080
not really but it's still you know

00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:44,200
happening he's gonna see that video I

00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:46,810
want went anyway so what will you get

00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:50,340
from that manager you will retain your

00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:53,620
talents and you will attract new talents

00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:55,660
because the those guys will live in an

00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:58,810
environment where they have great tools

00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:04,960
but they also have the culture the

00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:07,420
mindset the way we enhance collaborators

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,460
life really so this is what they're

00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:12,340
gonna get and this is what I want you to

00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:15,730
live with if you want to connect with me

so many stories about how we implemented

00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:28,270
a new culture and your mindset but again

00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:30,850
this is my perspective from enterprise

00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:33,430
because at github you guys sometimes

00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:37,090
believe that we're doing awesome that

00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:39,490
cultures there it is not it is not and

00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:42,250
these people like me like javi like

00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:44,230
others that are actually thriving to do

00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:48,260
this so we need your help on this and

00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:51,200
also please don't contact me about

00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:53,660
episodes that I did not watch yet I

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,250
would be really really sad and I'm

00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:59,059
probably will kill you

00:30:55,250 --> 00:31:00,890
so yeah I'm serious

00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:03,230
