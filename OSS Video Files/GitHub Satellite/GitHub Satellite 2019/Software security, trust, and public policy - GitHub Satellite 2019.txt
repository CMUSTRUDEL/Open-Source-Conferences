Title: Software security, trust, and public policy - GitHub Satellite 2019
Publication date: 2019-05-28
Playlist: GitHub Satellite 2019
Description: 
	Presented by Mike Linksvayer, Director, Policy, and Marietje Schaake, Member of the European Parliament

Through funding, regulation, and agenda setting, public policy can and does make software more secure—and less secure. This session will dig into case studies in Europe of how public policy has supported security, or inadvertently threatened to make software more fragile, including how these policies came about, how they impact software security, and how developers influenced the policies. We’ll also cover how developers and industry are working with policymakers and governments to ensure policy supports rather than undermines security and trust, and what you can do as a developer, team member, and citizen to help.
