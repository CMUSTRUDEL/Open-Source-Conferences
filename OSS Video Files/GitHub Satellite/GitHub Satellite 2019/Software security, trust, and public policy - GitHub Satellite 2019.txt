Title: Software security, trust, and public policy - GitHub Satellite 2019
Publication date: 2019-05-28
Playlist: GitHub Satellite 2019
Description: 
	Presented by Mike Linksvayer, Director, Policy, and Marietje Schaake, Member of the European Parliament

Through funding, regulation, and agenda setting, public policy can and does make software more secure—and less secure. This session will dig into case studies in Europe of how public policy has supported security, or inadvertently threatened to make software more fragile, including how these policies came about, how they impact software security, and how developers influenced the policies. We’ll also cover how developers and industry are working with policymakers and governments to ensure policy supports rather than undermines security and trust, and what you can do as a developer, team member, and citizen to help.

[Music]

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,760
good afternoon welcome to the session on

00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:22,180
software security software security

00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,660
trust in public policy you've heard a

00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:27,550
lot of really great news this morning

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:31,000
about supporting the open source

00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:32,439
ecosystem and enabling software

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,600
development to scale while keeping

00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:37,780
software while keeping software secure

00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:41,309
and throughout the rest of the day

00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:44,910
you're gonna be hearing more sessions on

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:49,660
more more tools and best practices for

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:52,510
doing open source well and great both in

00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:56,350
the community and and in enterprises and

00:00:52,510 --> 00:01:00,699
even using open source for good since

00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:02,769
this is a session on policy I think it's

00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:04,839
acceptable to and everybody's excited

00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:07,000
about these new tools and best practices

00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:08,590
and how they can deploy them like right

00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,229
now in your day to day jobs

00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:14,229
however this is a session on policy so I

00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:16,540
want to look I think I'm I have

00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:18,940
permission to look ahead a little bit

00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:22,060
I'm really excited about how these new

00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,860
tools and practices and support for the

00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,080
open source ecosystem are gonna play out

00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,470
over the next say 10 years it's going to

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,300
be amazing who knows what's gonna happen

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,730
however something else is gonna play out

00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:36,730
in that kind of timeframe that's also

00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:39,010
going to profoundly impact what

00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:42,340
developers build house how secure the

00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:44,530
software they build is going to be and

00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:47,290
really what what developers career paths

00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:49,530
are going to be and that is developments

00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:53,200
in public policy so I'm incredibly

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:56,500
pleased that we're able to have this

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,300
session at satellites where we're gonna

00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,720
try to talk about kind of the themes of

00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:04,120
the conference around the developers

00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:07,530
connecting with each other but also with

00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:10,989
the world and that includes policy

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,940
security and open source and look at

00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:15,910
them from the frame of public policy

00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:18,220
which is not something that's completely

00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:20,650
obscure and in fact developers can get

00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:23,590
involved in and be a be be informed

00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:26,200
about and I should say I'm Michael

00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:29,530
linker from the github policy team

00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:33,760
and kind of our hypothesis about the

00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:35,680
world is that the more developers and

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,530
policy makers talk to each other and

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,480
understand each other the better

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:43,450
policies will get the more secure

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,150
software the more secure software will

00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:49,900
gets and indeed the more secure society

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:53,190
will get and I I'm even more pleased to

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:56,380
have with me on stage

00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,390
Murrieta Chuck a member of European

00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,550
Parliament's from the Netherlands in

00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:03,100
fact just arrived by playing from

00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:06,340
Amsterdam after voting in the European

00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:09,239
Parliament elections and is really an

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:12,220
expert in cyber security policy and

00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,470
Internet policy and human rights and

00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,440
other things that are kind of adjacent

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:20,319
to that has been serving in the European

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,000
Parliament since 2009 working it has

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,880
been extremely influential on these

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,730
issues and not only in Parliament's but

00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:31,090
also in the press with columns in the

00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:34,299
Financial Times Bloomberg Wall Street

00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:35,829
Journal and also serving on many

00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:40,959
organizations that relate to

00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:46,660
cybersecurity and human rights and if I

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:49,720
know how to use the clicker whoops this

00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:53,290
seems to be out of okay great so you can

00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,959
see Maria's Twitter profile up there

00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:59,859
feel free to tweet about the session use

00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:01,989
the hashtag github policy in to welcome

00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:04,109
moriata thank you it's really good to be

00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:04,109
here

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,920
nice your being color schemes too in the

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,220
room so that's nice Thanks and you

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,989
cannot you can also see one of my

00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,930
richest columns in the press this is

00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:22,060
with Financial Times I pulled from from

00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:24,220
your home page about how governments

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,080
must halt the spread of commercial

00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,810
spyware so this is really just

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,510
indicative of how you're influencing the

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:34,750
conversation in a very very kind of

00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:36,520
informed way so I want I want to

00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,560
basically the structure of this

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,130
conversation is I want to talk about a

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:46,060
couple of case studies about how policy

00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:48,820
has been helping the to secure open

00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:52,000
software secure open source and other

00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,620
software and then where policy another

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,010
where policy has been kind of a threat

00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:59,740
to the robustness of the software

00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:02,830
ecosystem and then some broader context

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,289
for the long term role of policy and

00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:07,060
even geopolitics and in having a secure

00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:09,490
world that we can ship software in but

00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:13,770
but I want to start by just asking how

00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:16,240
what was your path to becoming AI a

00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:18,400
cyber security policy expert and

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,940
Internet really interested in Internet

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,680
policy etc so it started at the

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,780
University of Amsterdam where I was

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,840
actually really curious and not quite

00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:30,370
finding in my studies of sociology and

00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,710
American Studies what I wanted to do and

00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,930
there was a very new minor at the time

00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,090
so a small field of specialization

00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,460
called new media and this was more than

00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:42,520
twenty years ago so revealing my age a

00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:44,380
little bit there but this really allowed

00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,419
me to be introduced to the sort of

00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,370
connections between technological

00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:51,130
developments the emergence of the world

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:54,430
wide web globalization and what it meant

00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:57,910
for people society and human rights

00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:00,099
fundamental freedoms I'm not a better

00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:02,950
thinker I'm not an engineer I'm not a

00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:05,169
coder but I tried to look at where

00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:07,810
technology reaches and what implications

00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:10,090
it has for people and since then I've

00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:12,789
continued to visit hacker conferences

00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:15,010
I've been helped enormously by people

00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:16,930
like yourselves who have taken the time

00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,710
to sit with someone like me to allow me

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:21,230
to ask stupid questions

00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:23,870
and it's just basically by keeping track

00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:26,030
and by caring about this topic and what

00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:30,380
the impact of tech is on values and

00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:32,120
rights right and keeping track of in

00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:35,150
carrying that that's something I think

00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:40,280
that developers and technologists more

00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:42,470
broadly me too need to do in in your

00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,530
space basically about policy

00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:48,470
well yeah I'm convinced that if we could

00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:51,440
bring the worlds of governance politics

00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,810
and technology developments cyber

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,150
security closer together that would be

00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:58,580
better for everyone and I mean I think

00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,110
the the sort of alienation is mutual

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,350
sometimes right a very good friend of

00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,440
mine

00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:05,030
Andrew Roche always says politicians

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,270
don't know the difference between a

00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:11,150
server and a waiter and unfortunately I

00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,310
think that's often true but on the other

00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:16,240
hand a lot of people in tech are not

00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:18,530
very familiar to put it mildly with how

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,510
democratic processes work what is the

00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:23,210
best moment to intervene in a lawmaking

00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:25,760
process what language do you speak in

00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,729
order to build a constituency to build a

00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:31,220
coalition to reach those lawmakers that

00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:32,990
may not already be on board I mean

00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,550
ideally you would have someone sitting

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,950
here who's not working on cybersecurity

00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:39,289
who knows how to find a conference like

00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:40,640
github and who's gonna be open-minded to

00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:43,100
what is going on in the world of

00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,960
open-source so I think we all on the

00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,880
policy side on the political side but

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,370
also on the tech side would benefit a

00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,979
great deal from opening our real life

00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:54,770
bubble and sharing knowledge with each

00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:57,220
other in a constructive way right so

00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:00,590
continuing to kind of ask about your

00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:03,500
involvement in cybersecurity policy

00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:07,190
particularly I would I put up on the on

00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:09,820
the screen the global Commission of this

00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:12,470
on the stability of cyberspace

00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:14,510
cyberspace which you serve on and their

00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:17,150
mission statement which really kind of

00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,650
which you might not want to read word

00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:22,400
for word now but really kind of

00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:23,960
contextualizes the challenge of the

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,140
stability of cyberspace which certainly

00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:30,349
developers depend on to ship as almost a

00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,310
geopolitical kind of thing yeah but it's

00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:34,310
not

00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:38,510
I think everyone at least understands

00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:41,900
that legislation happens even if they

00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:45,230
don't understand the mechanics maybe but

00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:46,870
what role do groups like the global

00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:51,080
Commission on stability of cyberspace

00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:52,550
play and and I imagine that you must

00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,580
think it's compelling one because you

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,590
have you serve on it no I'm really

00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,940
really excited about this group it's a

00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,680
group of experts from all different

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,300
walks of life in all different parts of

00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,540
the world so truly people who bring

00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:07,730
their own expertise their own sense of

00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:10,730
which values are the most important and

00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:13,370
we are there to basically bridge the gap

00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:15,290
between what is happening in real life

00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:17,780
tensions between countries

00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,940
sometimes the compromising of technology

00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,880
or private sector companies non-state

00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:26,390
actors using technologies for attacks

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:29,720
for undermining trust for geopolitical

00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:32,360
goals etc etc and on the other hand the

00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,580
sort of heavy process of lawmaking or

00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:39,200
even the development of international

00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:41,060
law and international procedures so the

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,420
global Commission is actually trying to

00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:46,490
put forward proposals that are not law

00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,860
but that are in the in the realm of

00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,589
norms so they are softer than law but

00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:54,350
they are designed to be a common

00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:56,750
denominator where states private sector

00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:59,930
companies civil society actors cyber

00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,960
security experts NGOs can find each

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:04,850
other in a common interest for example

00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,620
one of the proposed norms and we would

00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,870
actually very much welcome your feedback

00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,920
on all the proposed norms but I think

00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,010
specifically this one might be

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,380
interesting for for your community is

00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:18,020
that we propose a norm of protecting the

00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:20,410
public core of the open Internet in

00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:23,600
other words all the infrastructure

00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:27,080
routers domain name systems that are

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:31,339
fundamental for everything to you know

00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:33,050
cross over the web to not be a space for

00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:35,089
attacks so essentially to consider it

00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,440
like a neutral zone in the same way that

00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:39,140
countries can consider themselves

00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:42,080
neutral in a war to basically say once

00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:44,510
this becomes a theater for conflict

00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,310
which it is of course gradually becoming

00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,660
then there is only one direction which

00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,550
is a race to the bottom and it will

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,470
actually equally impact countries like

00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,720
China and the United States it will

00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:56,270
equally impact the average Internet user

00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,830
and a big corporation and this is not

00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:00,620
the direction we want to go in and

00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:03,680
there's a whole set of of norms we have

00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:06,320
I think seven now ranging from a norm

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,170
around electoral integrity and the the

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,390
role of technology but also supply

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:13,460
chains I think it's a hot topic these

00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:16,010
days you know how do private companies

00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:18,830
make sure that the software and hardware

00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:21,260
as well are not commandeered are not

00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:24,170
manipulated are not instrumentalized for

00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:28,250
attacks so I think it's it's an effort

00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:30,080
to raise the bar of norms of good

00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:33,320
behavior and getting different

00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,090
stakeholders to agree okay fantastic if

00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,520
we have time I when I can - I want to

00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:39,680
kind of come back to the norms thing at

00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:43,160
the at the end though so I want to I

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:48,710
want to move on to our a case study

00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:51,520
where the EU in particular government is

00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:55,160
doing some things to help improve

00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,600
open-source security and there's a

00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,360
program called fossa that you've

00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,650
actually been involved in enabling I

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,230
wonder if you could tell us a little bit

00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:05,720
about that yeah sure so one observation

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,820
was that in the market we saw a lot of

00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,860
bug bounty programs and you know

00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,270
incentives for hackers to use their

00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,030
knowledge towards the greater good

00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:15,920
instead of selling to the highest bidder

00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:19,880
who could also be you know criminal

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:22,250
network or worse but there's there's now

00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,110
increasingly bug bounty programs by big

00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:27,740
corporations like Microsoft and others

00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:29,570
there are now platforms for bug bounties

00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,720
I'm sure you're you're all familiar with

00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:34,190
these but in the open-source space there

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,020
are different incentives there's not

00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:38,810
such a market-driven incentive and so

00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:41,540
what we wanted to do is to create a

00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:43,280
little budget and especially create

00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,510
awareness to be honest on the part of

00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,270
the European Commission which is

00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:49,280
obviously a huge buyer and user of

00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:51,590
software whether it's for piyah Tory or

00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,150
open source software so to really start

00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,920
to thinking about what can the

00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:56,690
Commission and what can government's

00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,930
more broadly do as

00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:03,290
the buyers in these markets to kick into

00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:05,810
place procedures where hackers are also

00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:08,079
rewarded and recognized more importantly

00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:12,800
sometimes than remunerate 'add

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:15,259
remunerated when they fix a bug or

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,690
identify vulnerability in open source

00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:19,220
software and so we created this as what

00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:22,009
is called a pilot project which is

00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:24,470
basically kind of like a startup in

00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:26,360
policy you really want to kick-start a

00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,759
process and make some budget available

00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,670
and it's been a big success already

00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:34,009
there have been hackathons organized and

00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,970
even though the people responsible in

00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:36,769
the European Commission were a little

00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,779
bit apprehensive at first this often

00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:41,720
happens when they have to deal with new

00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:43,490
things they are now the most excited

00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,069
about being part of this process and I

00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,560
really encourage you to look at it it's

00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:49,940
it's about open source so it should

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,790
really meet your world and your

00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:56,029
expertise and I hope it can begin to

00:13:52,790 --> 00:14:00,500
bridge this larger gap between tech

00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:03,100
experts security experts and policy

00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:06,230
makers to think about the most

00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:08,180
economically smart securities smart but

00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:10,160
also democratically smart essentially

00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,810
way of working with software and that's

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,269
how I see open-source software is the

00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:17,180
more democratic way of working with

00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:18,920
technology great so do I so and ask

00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,769
follow-up to that I wonder if there are

00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,649
if there are other programs in the you

00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:26,180
that's relating to open source or cyber

00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:28,550
security that developers don't really

00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:32,180
ought to be aware of and I I want to

00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:34,759
highlight a a I just put up on the

00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:37,100
screen an excerpt from a European

00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:38,959
Commission slide deck on open-source

00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,180
strategy and I think the interesting

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,220
thing for people in this audience might

00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,079
be that it will be very familiar for

00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,240
anybody's thought about kind of open

00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:49,399
source maturity in the enterprise where

00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,259
you start to use open source maybe you

00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:53,120
don't even know you're using open source

00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:54,680
and then you're you know purposefully

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,329
using it and then you're producing it

00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,790
and contributing and you hope that it's

00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:00,860
gonna contribute to transforming your

00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:03,470
enterprise well government at least a

00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,910
forward-thinking government entity like

00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,189
the European Commission it actually has

00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:08,990
the same strategy so I wonder are there

00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:10,399
other ways for developers to kind of

00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:13,610
engage either with

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,329
with with you institutions on this kind

00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,490
of strategy

00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:18,350
definitely so I'm convinced that we're

00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,999
gonna see for better or worse but that

00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,069
we're gonna see a lot of tech policy

00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:25,069
decisions being made in the next couple

00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:27,730
of years I think on content moderation

00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:29,720
who decides what stays up what goes down

00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:32,480
questions of intermediary liability

00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,339
exemptions there's going to be a lot of

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,829
policies developed and if we don't want

00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:38,360
to see a repetition of the copyright

00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:40,730
directive that I think has disappointed

00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:44,360
many of us in this room then it really

00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:46,759
helps to get engaged in a broad sense so

00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,670
basically to start thinking about what

00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:51,949
are important aspects of technological

00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,660
developments to share what are areas

00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:56,540
where open-source can make a difference

00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,550
how can you all be a part of sharing

00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,860
knowledge with lawmakers so that when

00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,209
the time comes and for example the

00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,939
e-commerce directive is going to be

00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:08,420
renegotiated or the cybersecurity Act

00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:10,519
which has just been adopted is going to

00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,680
be reviewed or whatever that you don't

00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:14,410
start from scratch but that you build on

00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,629
a sort of broader knowledge foundation

00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:20,230
and there's a lot to look at I mentioned

00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:22,699
the cybersecurity act but there's also

00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,980
recommendations in there for a

00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:26,689
vulnerability disclosure on the part of

00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,209
governments and on the part of private

00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:30,679
sector companies where when you look at

00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:32,209
the European landscape there is an

00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:35,870
enormous difference there are countries

00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:37,610
like my own which is a coincidence but

00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,800
also friends that have fairly

00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:42,350
sophisticated vulnerability disclosure

00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:45,379
mechanisms but there's also countries

00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:48,259
that are still beginning to grasp the

00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:49,639
importance of this process and so from a

00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:51,889
European point of view it's good to do

00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:53,839
this in a harmonized way but from a

00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:55,819
national or even local point of view

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,829
it's also important the people that are

00:16:55,819 --> 00:17:01,009
responsible for these decisions see why

00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:03,079
it matters so I believe that from the

00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:05,890
policy angle from the implementation of

00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:08,089
policy angle and from a sort of general

00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:09,620
interest perspective it would be really

00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:12,409
good to see more and even more

00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:14,089
systematic exchanges between communities

00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:16,760
like yours the open source community and

00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:19,100
lawmakers okay fantastic

00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,780
you mentioned that many people here

00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:24,120
probably didn't like the outcome of the

00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:27,470
copyright directors see hands for people

00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:29,340
who were thrilled by it but yeah so

00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,980
that's actually what I want to talk

00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:34,680
about next I we were talking about ways

00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:39,870
that government could kind of help make

00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:41,940
the software ecosystem more robust for

00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:45,150
example by doing things like bug

00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:48,660
bounties so now copyright directive is

00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:50,970
actually a case study and how policy

00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,150
potentially makes the software ecosystem

00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:56,750
more fragile more fragile and I put up

00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:59,190
on this on the screen

00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:02,340
github the initial blog posts where we

00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:05,330
sort of highlighted the potential

00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:09,360
threats to the software ecosystem and

00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:13,280
the console readout that you see there

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:16,350
is not real fortunately but the idea is

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:21,180
potentially if software development

00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:23,040
platforms have been falling under this

00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,270
this directive then potentially

00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,790
automated filtering would have been

00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:30,060
necessary and that really could have

00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:31,950
made the the software ecosystem more

00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:34,500
fragile because it could have you know

00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,940
your critical security fix might have

00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,640
been blocked because you know it's a

00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,380
false positive to this filter that that

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,450
we were forced to implement so we put

00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:46,410
out a call to developers and actually we

00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:48,150
had a lot of developers particularly who

00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:50,670
contribute to open source who actually

00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:52,170
wrote to their MEP s including some who

00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:54,120
are involved in the negotiation

00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:58,890
negotiations around the directive and

00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:02,430
said hey the software industry is just

00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:04,650
not pertinent to this you you know you

00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:07,590
really want to go after social media

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:10,490
platforms maybe but this is only going

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:12,450
to harm us and they actually listened

00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:15,840
but of course that doesn't mean that

00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:18,210
what was actually passed even though

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,920
this fortunately this exclusion actually

00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,690
made it and made it into the final

00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,840
legislation but that doesn't mean it

00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:29,160
doesn't have any harms or that something

00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:30,830
like it where we're you know where

00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,270
software development is inadvertently

00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:35,350
targeted isn't going to happen again so

00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:37,419
I I wonder if you can say some

00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:39,280
thing about I don't know how that all

00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:42,130
happened - maybe lessons for developers

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,900
going forward yeah so I think the the

00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:46,330
copyright directive will go down in

00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:48,700
history as one of the decisions with

00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:52,120
most unintended consequences and with

00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:53,530
most derailed lobbying on both sides I

00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,510
should say because some of the emails

00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:58,419
that you sent thank you for that there

00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:59,620
were quite a few and it irritated a lot

00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:02,530
of people and some of them were of

00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:04,600
course automatically sent through or

00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:06,580
whatever because they included exactly

00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,520
the same words which is usually kind of

00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,870
a hint for lawmakers to see that there's

00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,580
you know that they're steered centrally

00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:15,850
and that it's not citizen by citizen who

00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:19,360
is writing the same letter but also from

00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:21,880
the part of the publishing houses from

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,330
the movie producers the the music

00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:27,340
industry I mean it was really a tragic

00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:29,679
display of promises you know that

00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:32,080
democracy would be saved that the free

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,360
media would be saved all by copyrights

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,860
well if I think history doesn't have

00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,950
such a great track record of all the

00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,030
positive impact that copyright

00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:43,059
protection has really brought the world

00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:46,480
so I would have liked to see this law

00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:48,190
pass without filtering requirements

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,280
effectively even though it's not there

00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,750
in wording and without an additional

00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,610
copyright protection for publishers I

00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,169
think it is justified to update the

00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:58,809
copyright protection it's an outdated

00:20:56,169 --> 00:21:01,240
law technology changes very fast it can

00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:05,380
also be enabling for companies to reach

00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:07,750
larger audiences but the the intentions

00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:10,480
must have been good I have no doubt to

00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:12,760
to challenge my colleagues on that but I

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,730
think that the execution was horrendous

00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:18,909
and probably one of the reasons is that

00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:21,130
in the absence of a better understanding

00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:23,890
of how the internet works what an upload

00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:26,830
filter really is who could be caught in

00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:28,240
the net unintended ly in the absence of

00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:30,809
a deeper understanding of how these

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,669
technologies work how the internet works

00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:37,120
promises by by lobby groups on both

00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:39,340
sides started to lead their own life and

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,070
so it was really hard to roll that back

00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:44,559
when voting time came it had been a

00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:46,450
quite a bit quite an entrenched debate

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,070
so it was hard for politicians to sort

00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,840
of climb down from a position

00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,310
that they had taken even though some of

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,980
them privately came to me and said I

00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,630
think I made the wrong decision right so

00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,130
I think this really goes to show that

00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:00,100
having a broader discussion about how

00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:02,680
tech works and anticipating laws earlier

00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:05,440
on building trust with lawmakers who

00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,700
sometimes have you know a certain image

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,250
in their minds when they hear the word

00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,470
hacker when they hear the word coding I

00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,840
mean I've heard some people referring to

00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:16,030
their inboxes being hacked just because

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,190
they received so many emails which you

00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:21,490
know it could have still been hacked but

00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:23,560
it's not necessarily shown by a number

00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:26,260
of emails coming in so there's still a

00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:29,140
lot of work to do also to show that

00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:31,260
hackers can have you know very good

00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,820
intentions and constructive

00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:37,240
contributions to make to democracy

00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:40,830
society etc right absolutely so staying

00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:43,470
on the copyright directive for a moment

00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:47,050
because it's not over actually there's a

00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:49,330
process of translating of transposing

00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:52,360
the directive international law which

00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:54,460
yeah to somebody from the US like myself

00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:57,460
it's pretty unfamiliar but it's how a

00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:59,890
directive works so that will probably be

00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:01,810
considered the exact implementation will

00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:03,670
probably be continued to be lobbied

00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:06,220
around there's actually there will be a

00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:07,450
lot of prosecution and like legal cases

00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,310
around this which i think is very

00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,840
unfortunate I mean I think the copyright

00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:13,600
directive was the best result for

00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,610
lawyers to be honest because this

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,230
ambiguity between the European decision

00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:19,420
and the implementation on the member

00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:22,600
state level will no doubt be used for

00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:24,670
all kinds of litigation right so there's

00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,320
there's this there's a statement by some

00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,760
Member States that was published and I

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,400
actually first became aware of it

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,140
through your Twitter feed actually and

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,780
the statement by Germany is actually

00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:36,880
particularly interesting and good and I

00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,860
put up on the screen two little brief

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,500
excerpts I think are worth discussing

00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:44,580
really quickly so one just that they are

00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:46,420
you know talk about how important the

00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:48,460
exclusion of software development

00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:51,130
platforms and we encyclopedias like

00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:53,050
Wikipedia is so they're not not under

00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,730
this regime but the other perhaps even

00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:56,590
more interesting one is that to the

00:23:54,730 --> 00:24:00,250
extent there are technical measures

00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:01,870
required that the you should invest in

00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:03,870
open-source development

00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:06,250
around them I think that's quite

00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:08,910
interesting maybe because even though we

00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:11,650
might not like upload filters or maybe

00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:15,010
you know similar mandates that come with

00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:17,980
other regulation if if in fact they're

00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:21,490
potentially impactful to democratic

00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:23,410
discourse wouldn't it be good if and we

00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:24,970
want you know even small platforms to

00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:27,850
have them wouldn't it be good if there

00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:29,950
were share technologies that did not

00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:32,320
kind of create competitive motes and

00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:33,760
also allowed you know journalists

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,160
researchers to actually look at the

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,750
implementation so this is so it's kind

00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,120
of interesting that the German statement

00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:41,920
highlighted that I wondered if you have

00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:46,860
any thoughts about kind of open source

00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:51,130
becoming a part of the policy toolbox

00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:53,380
around transparency and competition that

00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:56,050
maybe could be more frequently reached

00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:58,450
to you yeah I think you touch on a much

00:24:56,050 --> 00:25:01,570
broader point which is really where in

00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:03,730
today's world where digitization often

00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:07,000
means privatization is the public

00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:09,700
interest protected and even if some of

00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,800
the policy processes lead to results

00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,540
that not everybody is happy about the

00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,150
effort I believe is entirely legitimate

00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:19,450
to make sure that the rule of law also

00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:21,840
applies online and that principles like

00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:25,450
non-discrimination fair competition

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:28,420
access to information etc etc are upheld

00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:30,280
somehow and I think that open source as

00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,710
I mentioned before sort of the more

00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:36,100
democratic way the more public interest

00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:39,460
way of dealing with challenges and and

00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:42,100
digitization so yes I see a big role

00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:44,440
there but I I believe there's a lot of

00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,730
steps that could be taken I should be

00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,250
taking on the part of governments to

00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:52,960
recognize much more what their own role

00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:56,020
is as sending you know tenders and and

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,570
procurements into the markets setting

00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:01,870
setting the the terms of reference for a

00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:04,740
number of developments as well as making

00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:08,700
laws so I think bringing these

00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:11,410
communities closer together and also to

00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:14,630
hear from the open source community in

00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:16,580
slightly more layman's terms what

00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:18,610
be done because one of the great things

00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:21,680
about people like you is that you are

00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:23,780
experts geeks you know a lot of stuff

00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,160
about very specific things but that

00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,000
doesn't mean that people understand what

00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,710
you're talking about when you're

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,280
explaining it and so what we need to do

00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:33,320
is bridge these gaps I often feel like a

00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,540
bit of an interpreter you know trying to

00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,430
frame certain debates that I hear in

00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:39,560
communities like yours or at the Chaos

00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:42,470
Computer Club or or other techie

00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,330
conferences and then to think about if I

00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:46,220
had to explain this to let's say the

00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:48,770
equivalent of my mother where would I

00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,910
begin and I think that is what is more

00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:51,800
needed in order to get much better

00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:54,050
results because a lot of the terminology

00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,400
even open source I think a lot of people

00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:59,180
don't even really know what that is

00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:01,280
right yeah that is all too true and you

00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:03,560
said the word non-discrimination in

00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,870
there so that's a great segue because I

00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:09,110
want to take the opportunity of having

00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:11,840
you here to also ask you about something

00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:15,110
that isn't directly related to security

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:18,080
but is about kind of securing the policy

00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:20,510
ecosystem to allow developers to compete

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,580
on a level playing field and not be not

00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:25,730
have to ask permission to ship to ship

00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:29,660
new products and you can probably guess

00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:31,760
what that is its network neutrality

00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:34,910
right and so I think that you play the

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:37,640
kind of a key role in in ensconcing they

00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:39,890
use network neutrality regulation and

00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:42,320
also very interesting you did some kind

00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:44,630
of cross border advocacy and led this

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,360
letter that I have up on the screen that

00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:50,660
I believe 148 of your colleagues sign

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,890
encouraging the u.s. to do the same so I

00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,860
wonder if you could say a few words

00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:56,810
about how it I also wanted to mention

00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:59,480
the the European Commission also just

00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:02,420
published a study basically saying that

00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:06,790
all stakeholders are flying with network

00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:09,020
neutrality in the EU and I wonder what

00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:10,940
developers in other parts of the world

00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:14,330
that maybe don't have that could learn

00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:15,770
from your experience yeah so I think the

00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:17,390
example for net neutrality is a really

00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:19,670
good one also building on what we just

00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:21,830
discussed you know trying to get

00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:24,740
concepts to be understood by larger

00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:26,600
groups of people so net neutrality for

00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,800
the longest time was this technical term

00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,420
that a lot of my colleagues

00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,090
like okay yeah I don't know what she's

00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:34,130
doing is probably not very relevance so

00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:38,140
we don't have to understand the details

00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:40,700
of net neutrality but by framing it as

00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:45,550
rules of the road for the digital

00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:48,370
economy or as a fair competition online

00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:50,750
more people also those who care about

00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:52,040
competition issues or who care about the

00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:54,230
digital economy or digital signal

00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,930
markets as well as people who care about

00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:58,580
the preservation of the open Internet

00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:59,900
started to see that it also mattered to

00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:03,320
the things that they wanted to achieve

00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:05,420
and it was a tough battle just like the

00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,920
copyright one mean the telcos initially

00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:09,050
were not very thrilled to see net

00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,700
neutrality in fact it was one of the

00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:13,600
reasons why we started to discuss it at

00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:16,520
all because telecom operators were

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,790
throttling or even cutting off access to

00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:22,460
voice over IP competition which is

00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:23,540
obviously not allowed one because

00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,190
they're not allowed to look at where

00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:28,070
you're surfing whether you're going to

00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:30,200
use whatsapp or Skype or whatever and

00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:32,840
two because they cannot use their

00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:35,680
privileged position of providing access

00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,970
to the Internet for example to

00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,440
discriminate against which website you

00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:42,830
want to go to and that is what we have

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,230
now put in in European law and I'm glad

00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:46,460
that that the players have stopped

00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:47,870
complaining I mean I'm not sure that

00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,190
they're very happy but I guess they're

00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:51,830
respecting the law which is a very

00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:56,000
normal thing and I wish that in the u.s.

00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:59,350
it could stay you know as is or as was

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:03,080
agreed before it it got on our mind

00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:04,490
again by the FCC right well we're

00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:07,100
working on that

00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:10,310
so I want to move move back to sort of

00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:12,830
broader norms and even geopolitics and I

00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:14,510
want to do that by highlighting a paper

00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:16,850
that you've published in the Georgetown

00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:19,250
Journal of International Affairs called

00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:21,560
a rules-based order to keep the internet

00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:25,640
open and secure and who could argue with

00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:27,950
a title like that the well that's good

00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,560
most people would probably find this

00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:32,450
fairly boring but thank you it's it's

00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:36,020
really not actually written it's it's

00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:37,430
quite short I want to say 10 to 12 pages

00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:39,470
and it's it's quite readable so I

00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:41,360
encourage I encourage you to look this

00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:42,830
up it's actually a really

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,740
interesting framing for kind of what's

00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:49,400
happening in the world of technology and

00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:52,160
policy today and I want to try to give

00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,420
you my take away from it and we can we

00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:57,500
can we can see how it goes from there

00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:59,870
yes I mean basically the US and EU have

00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:02,110
typically at least advocated for a

00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:04,160
rules-based internet order in

00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:07,400
international order and specifically

00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:09,340
rules based internet but over the last

00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:12,049
few years

00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:13,549
do you they've kind of backed away or

00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:15,770
we've kind of backed away from that

00:31:13,549 --> 00:31:17,870
because we see the Internet is something

00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:20,900
to be feared now not necessarily

00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:23,570
something to be to be fostered and into

00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:26,210
that gap we have a bunch of we have kind

00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:31,730
of alternative models of that are like

00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:35,559
liked by authoritarian regimes and there

00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:38,480
are how do we get how do we get back to

00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:40,280
to you know appropriate regular

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,350
regulation good regulation but but that

00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:47,210
defends this rule bit rules-based order

00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:49,880
and makes it makes it global and there

00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:52,010
are precedents for doing that so do I

00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,140
have the sort of outline of the

00:31:52,010 --> 00:32:00,820
arguments close to rights and I wonder

00:31:54,140 --> 00:32:03,140
how can developers actually act on this

00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:05,480
you know kind of first order of

00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:07,970
geopolitical thing that seems very

00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:11,150
detached at the nation-state level but

00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:12,530
in fact profoundly impacts you know

00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:14,960
whether they'll be able to collaborate

00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:17,000
across borders in the future like is

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,190
taken for granted now nevermind ship

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,169
product across borders exactly so I I

00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:23,210
think what we've seen very broadly

00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:25,970
that's what I'm trying to also highlight

00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:29,240
in the article is that traditionally so

00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:31,490
let's imagine pre-internet democracies

00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,799
European countries United States some

00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:36,470
other countries have believed in the

00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:39,559
notion that the rule of law is is sacred

00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:42,590
that people's rights and freedoms and

00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:45,320
some principles need to be protected but

00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:47,690
strangely enough despite some sound

00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,130
bites like an Internet freedom strategy

00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:51,820
that Hillary Clinton rolled out etc

00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:53,870
there has not been a fundamental

00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:56,120
transposing or

00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:57,830
extension of this rules-based order to

00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,360
the online digital world and I think

00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:01,850
there's a couple of reasons for that one

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,340
I'm sure you all know the Declaration of

00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:06,470
Independence of cyberspace of John Perry

00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:09,830
Barlow but this sort of libertarian

00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:12,470
ideology with which the developments of

00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:14,450
the world wide web started this notion

00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:16,250
that it was a different space that

00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,720
governments couldn't touch it and in

00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:20,030
fact that it was better that way

00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,770
and the regulation that has been there

00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:24,260
have been tax exemptions on her Bill

00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:26,630
Clinton have been this intermediary

00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:28,250
liability exception without which the

00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,090
internet would not look the way it looks

00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:32,210
today

00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:35,270
so I believe there has gradually because

00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:37,580
of some ideals in an isolated context

00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:39,410
namely of Silicon Valley there has been

00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,809
an absence of rules and principles

00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:44,059
articulated by the democracies of this

00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:46,160
world and another argument that we often

00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:47,630
heard I still hear today is don't

00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:51,380
regulate the internet because otherwise

00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:53,240
China will do the same well I wish China

00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:55,370
would listen to us because then we would

00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,020
be in a in a more democratic place you

00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:58,730
know altogether human rights would be

00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,620
more respected etc but the fact of the

00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:03,290
matter is that while we let's say the

00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:05,450
democracies of this world have not been

00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:08,300
as ambitious in developing the rule of

00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:10,760
law of line China and other author

00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:13,840
terian governments have been much more

00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:16,909
articulate ambitious and principled in

00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:20,000
rolling out their system of Garland's

00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:22,850
and in the meantime of course not to be

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,370
ignored a number of private companies

00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:27,710
are effectively setting norms whatever

00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:30,530
Facebook decides it's gonna leave online

00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:32,929
is norm setting because people can or

00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:34,280
cannot see it same goes for YouTube

00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:37,310
Google and the other big tech platforms

00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:39,980
so in other words I believe it is high

00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:41,690
time that democracies step up and that

00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,730
the rule of law becomes a leading

00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:45,290
concept again and that is what I would

00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,440
like to leave you with because I see red

00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:51,740
flashes here we're out of time stress

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:53,659
but that that the rule of law and

00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:56,090
protecting it including through

00:34:53,659 --> 00:35:00,110
regulation I fundamentally believe is a

00:34:56,090 --> 00:35:02,090
legitimate goal and for people who are

00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:04,600
developing new technologies and who are

00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:06,730
sometimes in a good way

00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:10,450
pressing the boundaries a bit of what is

00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:12,760
possible to think about how the rule of

00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:14,500
law serves all of us whether you're in

00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,780
the open-source community in the private

00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,880
sector in civil society in governments

00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:21,430
because it is the foundation of our

00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,960
freedoms and I really hope and believe

00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:24,880
that when the tech community and

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,750
governments work together better we can

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,880
make a more robust and well resilient

00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:33,340
kind of kind of open Internet that also

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,110
protects our democracy and the rule of

00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,790
law so I hope we can work on that
