00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:12,660
my name is Mario Rodriguez and I'm a

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:17,100
head of product for the enterprise queue

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:19,560
of get up so if you have any questions

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,529
and concerns about github Enterprise

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,840
itself please find me after the talk I'm

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:26,730
very good at listening and in fact you

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,189
know my URI of my job is actually going

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,990
out there and meeting customers and kind

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,880
of translating that into a vision and

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,790
strategy and the execution of the

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,760
product so thank you so much for being

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:41,190
here today

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,070
before we go deeper into the talk I just

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,289
wanted to do a small recap of the

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,300
announcements that we had today and kind

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,010
of not alluded to this thing you know

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,960
the theme of the conference in reality

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,239
is an interconnected community all the

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,980
way from open source kind of bringing

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,520
those open source into inner source and

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,980
the enterprise from maintainer x' to any

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,250
type of contributor are there that the

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,439
core theme is were all interconnected in

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,450
some way in this big kind of planet

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,090
scale collaboration platform that is

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,729
github today you know and he kind of

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,180
joked that you know there's this dogma

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:20,670
of a developer and you pass him pizza or

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,310
some red bull maybe and there's code for

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,350
me when I went to school actually it was

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,150
more like sessions of video games and

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,299
then coding sessions of video game and

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,460
decoding but you know like the reality

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,500
of it is we don't act we cannot do it

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,240
with the support before the waterline

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,329
and with the support of everyone over

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,549
here as well so the announcements and

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:43,320
there's a lot if you actually been to

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:46,799
other satellites you will notice that

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,630
this one is kind of action-packed a lot

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,579
of things that we announced on security

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,950
my favorite one is the dependable I've

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:56,189
been talking to grey for a long time now

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,689
it seems you know about about that

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:01,469
product about the feature about the laws

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:03,270
that people have with it and then we

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:04,979
talked a little bit about enterprise and

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,200
you can see their enterprise accounts

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,840
internal repos are is mainly for inner

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,720
sourcing to our new roles and

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,460
permissions and insights all the way to

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,070
community

00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:19,430
tribution in everything in beholden

00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,660
sponsors so I'll add there again after

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,220
the talk you could find me I could

00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,990
probably talk about any of those items

00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,660
if you didn't go to the other talk so I

00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:29,980
want to get more details then we could

00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:33,680
actually do that as well so that's

00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:35,900
that's kind of a summary of it

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,910
so within Enterprise for us in

00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,560
enterprise it actually starts with trust

00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,880
that's the Meyer II of the conversations

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,260
that I go into there's a little bit

00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,300
about features a little bit about

00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:48,560
transformation there's a lot about trust

00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:51,410
as well so some stats for you 50% of the

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,740
glow of Fortune 100 actually uses key

00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:58,250
hub Enterprise amia specifically what we

00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:00,800
call kind of Europe has seen 2.5 x

00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:03,140
growth on the hub Enterprise it's one of

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,210
our strongest markets and then we've

00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,560
done a lot in when it comes to security

00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,300
and vulnerabilities you can see a little

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,150
bit there about tokens discover in

00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:14,300
public repos 28 million which is kind of

00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:16,640
interesting that we discover secrets 20

00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,260
million times but we're actually adding

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,980
value and hopefully that number

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,270
continues to go down not not up that

00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,670
that's one of the metrics that we

00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,140
actually try to not increase instead of

00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,640
because we're probably not doing the

00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,260
right thing at the end so I will give

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:35,240
you more features in there too for that

00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:38,710
so the talk today it's about scale but

00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:41,600
you might be asking yourself ok Mario

00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,760
there's you have to kind of ways to

00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,590
deploy github Enterprise today you have

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,630
the server product and you have the

00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,670
cloud product when it comes to the cloud

00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,070
we manage all these scaling for you all

00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,810
of the other scaling so like we could

00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,490
probably spend 5 milliseconds on that

00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,350
and maybe after that we will have to

00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:00,710
talk about bid comes price or something

00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:03,440
else so then on server it's a little bit

00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:05,150
more but to tell you the truth I don't

00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,040
know how many you guys know this but we

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:10,280
should give hub server in an appliance

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,650
and it's pretty pretty easy to maintain

00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,510
in fact I actually set up as well and

00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,989
Manish and all that in fact I was

00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:19,460
talking to our customers yesterday and

00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:20,989
when they started at the opportune they

00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:23,120
were like no there's no way that it I

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:25,100
all we have to do is kind of put it over

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,820
here hit this button and it's up and

00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,950
they say

00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,450
and it took them longer actually to

00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,860
research that we were telling the truth

00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:33,710
that it took them to set up the

00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:36,080
appliance so it's pretty easy so the

00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:38,240
talk is really not about how to scale of

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,640
your infrastructure and all of those

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,100
type of things there's a lot of great

00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,840
content out there on it what I really

00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:47,780
really want to talk about when it comes

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,490
to scale it's really how to scale your

00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,590
organization and the practice of you're

00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,750
gonna session on github so there's three

00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:57,380
things that when I go to an enterprise I

00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:59,390
get asked continuously about one is you

00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,820
know we want to use more open source how

00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:04,250
can we do that effectively how can we

00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:07,220
both consume and how can we contribute

00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,930
more effectively in fact one of the you

00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,310
know the features a lot of people run

00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,290
right now is just being able to actually

00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,170
take a public repo and then put it in a

00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:17,000
github instance servery on-premises and

00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:19,730
and had that fort actually work very

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,770
well but you know they want to consume

00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:23,630
the one I utilized and they want to

00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,280
contribute in a seamless way with open

00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:27,620
source now how can you actually do that

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,990
at scale really with one repo it works

00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,580
by hugging do it at scale what what are

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,980
the things that need to happen to do

00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,820
that there then there's collaboration

00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,620
and inner source

00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,830
how should I actually be studying on the

00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,600
structure of my github enterprise

00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:44,390
internally to all our collaboration to

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,970
faster I was talking to another customer

00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:48,500
they had three servers very hard for

00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,940
actual collaboration to happen in three

00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,520
different servers with three different

00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,440
set of identities and all of that and

00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,320
then the last one is how can we do all

00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,420
of this in a way that really has that

00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,540
security and compliance because I am an

00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:05,180
enterprise I had to pass audits I have

00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:07,250
to you know show a set of people that

00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,320
we're doing this at the right way and to

00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,970
understand if there's a breach you know

00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,010
there's a lot more that I ends up going

00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,320
in our enterprise that needs to be met

00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:20,330
that you don't get that maybe at the OSS

00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:22,520
the maintainer level as much so kind of

00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,200
my life revolves around making a set of

00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,270
you know listening trying to figure out

00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,230
what everyone is doing trying to make

00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,300
sure there's a set of best practices

00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:31,280
around it and that's really what I

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,020
wanted to talk about today is what are

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,300
those set of best practices that we're

00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,200
recommending as you try to kind of scale

00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,880
your

00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,310
the amount of people that end up using

00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:45,130
github and kind of within those three

00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,420
pillars and and themes so the first

00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,310
thing that I want to do is kind of talk

00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,800
about the core structure of how to help

00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:53,140
things about an enterprise and and

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,610
really you know there's a couple of

00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,590
slides over here that are really really

00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,450
important some of them you're not gonna

00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,820
agree with and again I'm very good at

00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:03,130
listening and taking that but this is

00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:06,160
what we see as best practices out there

00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:08,710
so the first thing and this is new and

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,810
we did it because it was needed to

00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,400
actually tell their story is that we

00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:15,700
introduced the concept of an enterprise

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,550
account and that enterprise account

00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:20,320
actually ends up being able to manage a

00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,210
set of organizations that are at the

00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,070
bottom so if you think about github

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,900
enterprise in the cloud you might have

00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:27,790
multiple works in fact there's very good

00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:31,570
reasons to have multiple orcs in

00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:34,030
organization and you want to kind of

00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:37,960
manage them holistically but you had no

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:39,910
construct no way of doing that in a way

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,520
that was you know a lot of people kind

00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:44,740
of wrote scripts and then hit our api's

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,510
and did a bunch of hacks because we'll

00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,550
hackers or developers but there was

00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:50,590
actually nothing helping them and you

00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,930
know we needed to step in and help them

00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:55,420
an anti Enterprise account is that so

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:58,300
when should you then have organizations

00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:00,670
we get asked this a lot as well which is

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,520
should I have one or should I have two

00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:06,100
works you have 50 orcs or a thousand

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,830
orcs and what we usually say is the

00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:11,110
following we don't want you to map an

00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:13,420
org to a product we see sometimes that a

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,580
lot like okay I have a product let me

00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:17,770
just do a note for it that that's

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:20,770
probably not the right granularity level

00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:22,930
for it an org should be something like a

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:25,090
division within your company or a set of

00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:27,310
things are grouped together in some type

00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:29,050
of theme so a set of products are

00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,240
grouped to getting some sang with some

00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,220
type of theme and something creating

00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,960
that organization and again sometimes we

00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:37,540
see that as divisions within the company

00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,310
business units sometimes they could be

00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:41,260
very very small sometimes they could be

00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,970
big there are times that you want to

00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,400
keep things completely private and

00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:47,890
having an org that allows you to do that

00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,690
and have this core ability of everything

00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,250
within it

00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:54,550
sometimes we see these old names in

00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:57,790
github.com they are like you know 1 2 3

00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:59,350
F 78 and I'm like okay that's probably

00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:03,730
some secret project that they're trying

00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:05,410
to do but organizations think about it

00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,230
as business units it's kind of a theme

00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:10,960
of that pulls together a set of products

00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:12,220
so an enterprise account and today you

00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,290
could get one if you talk to your

00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,910
account representative are you buy and

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,100
you have your help enterprise there's a

00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:21,820
way for you to actually try that out and

00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:24,280
then organizations we also introduced

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,840
which I don't think we showed I wanted

00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,080
to demo for you guys but we have no way

00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,970
of doing demos in in the stage but this

00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,280
is what we call in kind of admin Center

00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:36,460
for that enterprise account so why you

00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:39,130
see in here is all of the organizations

00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:41,440
that belong to this enterprise none of

00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:43,480
them have we love avocados so I get hub

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,450
so there's a bunch of things within that

00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,560
theme there and you see all of the

00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:49,180
organizations you're gonna see the

00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:53,050
description a little bit more metadata

00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:55,510
this is kind of raw on purpose you also

00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:57,280
see people on the left-hand side there

00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:00,220
so you're gonna be able as an

00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:02,050
administrator of the enterprise you're

00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:05,440
gonna be able to go into that people tab

00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:07,750
and see every member across all of those

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,030
three orgs and repos that you have in

00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,800
your organization's every member of them

00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:13,810
you know we do them and all of those

00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,340
types of things and then you're also

00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:17,020
gonna be able to manage who are your

00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,730
enterprise admins who are your building

00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,800
admins and a couple of other things like

00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,970
that but you know that people tab is you

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,220
know if you have an auditor coming in

00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,510
and says who has access to github you

00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,860
could probably go to the people tab and

00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,860
those people have access to get help

00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,960
yeah so so that's that the other thing

00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,880
that you see in it is this concept of

00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,640
policies and right now is the beginning

00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:39,220
of what kind of division of policy at

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,890
github is at the enterprise level but

00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,720
think about like you have some SDLC or

00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,430
software lifecycle management and you

00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,200
want to do you want to start

00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,850
implementing a set of best practices and

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,170
a set of policies on it we're gonna

00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,270
allow you to do that at the enterprise

00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:54,400
level have that cascade nicely to your

00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:56,140
entire set of organizations there will

00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,540
be a set of things where you know maybe

00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:00,010
doesn't cannot apply to this orgs

00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,140
it should only be to these ones will

00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:03,220
allow that in the future as well but the

00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,720
idea

00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,879
that is we're going to start bringing

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,699
policy at the enterprise level and allow

00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,680
the central teams that actually do

00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:13,720
devil's practices architecture and all

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,120
of those things to be able to do that at

00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,949
a central level and then provide for

00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,420
usage to all of the organizations on

00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:22,149
rivers underneath we're very excited

00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:24,250
about that and we could pick out later

00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:25,930
on everything that is there and the last

00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,639
thing is just a set of settings normal

00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:29,639
stuff that allows you to maybe implement

00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:33,160
single sign-on at the enterprise level

00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:36,910
manage to manage buildings manage what

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:40,089
hooks and things like that so that's

00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,860
that so what about beneath the

00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:45,129
organization how she would be thinking

00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:47,139
about it so tread the way that we

00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:48,579
explain it usually is the way there are

00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:50,920
two main constructs that you should be

00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:52,689
thinking about there are products and

00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,910
there are people working on those

00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:56,939
products like those are the main two

00:11:54,910 --> 00:12:01,600
things that you should be optimizing for

00:11:56,939 --> 00:12:03,819
inside an organization so repos usually

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,149
map to products now there's many of you

00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:09,040
that actually practice micro services

00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:10,870
and they might have multiple repos per

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,160
product and that's perfectly fine please

00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,079
don't make it a hundred repos per

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,870
product I seen that a la try to keep it

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:19,360
kind of sane and at the end there but

00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:21,189
think about repos or a set of repos for

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,750
a product I know give up today

00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:24,189
especially in the enterprise doesn't

00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:27,310
give you a lot of constructs to group a

00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:29,529
set of repos together and actually do

00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:31,269
something with them but know that we've

00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:33,550
been hearing that feedback and there's

00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:35,800
an area of investment but again

00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,569
one repo per product or set of repos per

00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,490
product and then we want you to

00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:42,610
represent the people working on those

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:45,910
products by actually utilizing the team

00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:47,589
construct so many enterprises actually

00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,509
don't utilize it and it's one of the

00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:52,300
best features we have and will continue

00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:54,759
investment on that that allows a

00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,189
significant amount of value so think

00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:58,839
about okay maybe there are squads maybe

00:12:57,189 --> 00:13:00,670
they're you know they're feature teams

00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:03,759
whatever you you kind of want to think

00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:06,009
about them so you put them in a team and

00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,139
those are the people actually within

00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:10,089
that and then you add those teams into

00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:11,800
the repos and now you allowed the

00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:15,100
collaboration to happen that way

00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:19,569
so enterprise account and probably have

00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:21,339
a summary slide okay so the core

00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:23,319
structure essentially then is this an

00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:26,019
enterprise account for everything

00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:28,269
managed by the waying ghe server so

00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:29,939
that's our premises queue you also had

00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:32,680
this concept of an enterprise account

00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:37,269
and then you're going to be able to use

00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:39,790
it so if you go to 2.7 for our ghts

00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:41,980
release of 2.17 which you just announced

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,839
today then you're going to be able to

00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,740
see an enterprise account in it you're

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,439
going to be able to see all of the

00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,610
orders that belong on it and then kind

00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:50,829
of play with some of these features as

00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,870
well in addition to that you could even

00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:55,600
connect that enterprise account on your

00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:58,120
server to an enterprise account in the

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,399
cloud and allow kind of collaboration to

00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,779
happen that way does through a gear hub

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,850
Connect feature that we shipped last

00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:06,069
year and there's more you know we

00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:08,290
improved it we added more features and

00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:09,819
there's more value coming later in that

00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:12,579
too so we're pretty excited about that

00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:15,850
so enterprise account organizations to

00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:18,670
group products teams to to group people

00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:20,470
working on those products and then kind

00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:23,679
of repos for your products so that's

00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:25,990
kind of like what we call the core for

00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,519
your help and you know there are times

00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,949
we should do you should deviate from

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,439
this but please maritime if you do this

00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:33,579
as we add features to the product you're

00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:35,319
going to get a significant amount of

00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:36,670
value for free because you're kind of

00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:40,029
mashing what we determined to be the

00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,800
best practice out there okay so after

00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:44,949
you've done that then I want you to

00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,750
think about layering identity on top of

00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:48,490
what we said this is one of the hardest

00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,199
things that github sometimes it's a how

00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:53,019
do you do identity management and

00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:56,769
there's a lot for us to improve keeps me

00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:59,110
up at night at times but you know start

00:14:56,769 --> 00:15:00,880
by layering identity on top of it

00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:04,000
and what do we do by that we want you

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,160
actually to use even though a developer

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,189
and every github member uses a github

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,809
account that's perfectly fine but in the

00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:12,759
cloud that give up account actually

00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:14,559
follows them through jobs it's kind of

00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:16,449
like you know for the majority of the

00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:19,240
time it searches the resume as a

00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:21,910
developer so if I started on company a

00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,679
then I moved to B to C to D as an

00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:25,209
employer D you're gonna be able to kind

00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,080
of see okay he worked in all of these

00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:29,640
things he you know this whole

00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,620
contributions to open source and all of

00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,440
that so cut out the github account

00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:36,990
follows the human around right but the

00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,960
reality is the credentials to access the

00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:42,300
resources of an organization does not so

00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,490
if I was a company a and they assigned

00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,140
me an identity with an email and I have

00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,240
a password for that it's very different

00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:50,160
than my give up one you know whenever I

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,230
actually leave that company then my

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,850
identity kind of disappears from that

00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,770
those credentials I could no longer use

00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,690
them right because I'm no longer working

00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:59,370
at that company so think about it the

00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,680
same way like I want you to think about

00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,810
that enterprise account as your company

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,170
and I want you to then hook that up

00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:08,460
through samo to actually the identity

00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:10,590
provider that you have in your

00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:14,340
organization the identity provided that

00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:17,640
determines ok this is this you know

00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:19,470
human but within this org and it's very

00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,420
different under personal account right

00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:23,730
and these are really the credentials to

00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:26,460
access everything that let's say avocado

00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:28,980
Corp has so if you do that then every

00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:31,530
time I try to access anything within an

00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,150
organization I'm gonna get SSL I'm gonna

00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:36,180
get single sign-on with with that

00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:38,310
identity provider and then I could then

00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,980
put the credentials of avocado Corp in

00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:42,240
it and then I'm in and if I want to go

00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,920
and do something else in an open source

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,970
project they're not gonna you know

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,830
they're not going to ask me for those

00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:49,320
credentials so I'm gonna be using just

00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:51,150
my github account and and kind of the

00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,400
information that that carries

00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:56,550
so again layer identity at the

00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,650
enterprise layer before we had it at the

00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:01,550
organization you know now we're making a

00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:04,709
super easy to do it at the enterprise

00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:07,320
then after that I want you to think

00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:10,170
about we recently release a feature to

00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:12,600
allow member synchronization into a team

00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:15,089
so I layer that you know I later

00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:17,040
identity at the enterprise level and

00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:18,600
then after that then what I want you to

00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,459
do is say usually if you have an

00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,290
application you what you want to do is

00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:24,270
you want to go to your identity

00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:26,190
providers in a group it's probably

00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,870
usually a security group you ID be a

00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:30,600
developer and by doing that they get

00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:33,000
access to maybe you know github they may

00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:36,360
get access to JIRA some Jenkins stuff

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,870
some other kind of providers that you

00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:41,410
have to network shares to you know a lot

00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,150
of entitlements at the

00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:46,030
and you're managing all of that through

00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:47,440
one groove and it's great actually it's

00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:49,240
great for auditability because now you

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,070
know that if I remove that person from

00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,590
that groove they lose access to that

00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,600
application and everything you know it's

00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:57,700
not just github but it lose access to

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,470
every other service as well so we want

00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,560
to participate as part of that ecosystem

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:05,560
so one of the things that we will

00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:07,510
release on my seventh and now we're

00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,670
making publicly available in a beta

00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:11,830
format is the ability to sync membership

00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:13,900
from that identity provider group into a

00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:16,720
github team so again when you add that

00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,640
person in it automatically gets added to

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,410
the team they have access to what they

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,180
needed to when you that person leaves

00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:24,610
that team and then goes to another group

00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,780
within your company if they actually let

00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:27,310
the company that's easier because

00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,320
there's other ways to the provision the

00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:31,780
user but let's say that person doesn't

00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,610
need access anymore you remove them from

00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:36,580
a team we have a job a background job

00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,750
that ends up doing the sync and then we

00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,190
remove them from that team and they

00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,890
don't have access then to those repos

00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:43,450
anymore so think about it that way so I

00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:46,000
want you to layer identity at the top

00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,350
and kind of separate the credentials of

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,060
your organization from the github

00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,710
account at the end I don't want you to

00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,810
force that human to create two github

00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:54,850
accounts the one it's not very nice for

00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:57,160
them and the other thing is it's just

00:18:54,850 --> 00:19:00,370
not sustainable to do so I wanted you

00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:02,110
think about like you know put SSO on it

00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:04,870
and use the credentials of your

00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:06,120
organization and then do team sync it

00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:09,640
would actually save you a lot of time

00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:14,170
and that's what we did that feature okay

00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:16,390
then third thing is kind of think think

00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:18,060
a lot about access control and what are

00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:21,430
the rules that you're gonna support

00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:23,470
today we announced two new roles the

00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:25,990
triage role and think about three edge

00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:27,280
as you know you don't get commit access

00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,320
and it's not you know the my unit at the

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,240
time people think is about trust and

00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,470
it's not about trust it's not like that

00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,790
person doesn't trust them although

00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,890
there's probably a lot of developers in

00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:37,930
my team that don't trust me to actually

00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:40,840
have real access to a repo and we have

00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:42,670
some one of them over here but it's it's

00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,290
my real time it's not really about trust

00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:46,360
is really about scenarios like if you

00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:49,150
are for example if you're a maintainer

00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:51,340
and you want to get help from someone to

00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,260
triage in issues being able to actually

00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,030
do labels and things like that you want

00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,200
to extend that to them

00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,180
because that's what they're going to be

00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,380
mainly doing and they don't need access

00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,970
it's kind of like separation of concerns

00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,470
a little bit right

00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:04,930
they don't need access to it like it's

00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:06,850
very scenario driven same thing in the

00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:08,590
enterprise some phonetic project

00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:10,090
managers might need access to actually

00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,160
manage all of the issues of the project

00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:15,550
but they don't really need commit access

00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:17,680
at the end and then maintain think about

00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:19,480
as a senior developer I know Dana I

00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,100
joked about deleting repos and she's

00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,920
probably done a few times in her life

00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:26,380
but it's really about kind of editing

00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:29,140
descriptions you know being able to

00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:30,820
maintain a set of things force push into

00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:33,340
a branch there's a set of permissions in

00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:35,140
it right now we're in beta so there's

00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:37,540
three of them coming in and then three

00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,670
after once we g8 the feature but think

00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:42,100
about access control and rules you could

00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:44,410
envision that the next step for us to do

00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:46,840
is to really provide you the way to do

00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:49,030
custom roles and have full control of it

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,520
so if you're following the course

00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,840
structure and then you know when we

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,640
introduce a set of features to allow

00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,990
more granular permissions and

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,980
fine-grained permissions then you're

00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,650
going to be able to use those features

00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:01,930
very seamlessly so think about your

00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:04,870
access control my real-time be thinking

00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:07,900
about them as as our back or roles it

00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:09,190
kind of simplifies the model a lot but

00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,600
will give you flexibility if you don't

00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:16,840
want to actually think about it that way

00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:17,860
Tim so just a quick then summary on

00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,540
everything we discussed

00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,300
sam'l with single sign-on at the

00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,350
enterprise IDP with 2fa I know you're

00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,580
thinking actually I was in a

00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,560
conversation when our customer today

00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:29,800
what we're seeing right now in the

00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:32,500
industry is that people are not relying

00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,300
on github to do 2fa they're relying on

00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,790
their identity provider to do that to a

00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,800
PHA so when you're setting up sam'l and

00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:41,530
single sign-on you know if your identity

00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,330
provider you know allows you know to FA

00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,560
you automatically get to a Facebook or

00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,540
on it you don't have to enable that a

00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,770
github they actually makes a super hard

00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,620
for that developer because now they have

00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:52,720
to to fa1 twice essentially to get into

00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:56,140
an organization's resource so you want

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,000
to enable two FA which is to factor you

00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:01,600
know add the identity provider so azure

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,940
ad odd after like all of them I think

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,920
supported then you can even hook up with

00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,640
an app like duo or with a service like

00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,679
duo for example that's what

00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,200
at the end as well so please think about

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,000
it now that github level think about it

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,710
at the identity provider there's a lot

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,040
of efficient identity provider supports

00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:21,500
you external collaborators are tricky

00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,120
we're not doing anything right now on it

00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,950
but I will tell you like every time I go

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,420
into an enterprise it's probably a five

00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:28,250
to ten minute conversation about

00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:31,010
external collaborators and what we

00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:32,570
should be doing there the the thing that

00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:34,880
I will tell you towards the future is

00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:36,830
have a way to represent them many people

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,360
actually don't even have a way to say

00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,890
here's the query that will give me all

00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,500
of the external collaborators that I

00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:45,350
wanna have in it like things just happen

00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:47,750
by default and we want to provide a

00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:49,580
little bit more support to to make sure

00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,900
that external collaborators are getting

00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,940
that value but they're not actually

00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,100
getting access to the wrong things in

00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:56,179
your organization so and the only way

00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,309
we're gonna be able to provide that

00:22:56,179 --> 00:23:00,049
value to you guys is if you have a way

00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:02,390
to say these are the external

00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:04,340
collaborators or the inverse of it and

00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:06,350
say these are these are all the people

00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,390
that I trust in a given boundary that

00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:10,760
are not the external collaborators so

00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:13,100
think about them you'll hear more from

00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,809
us in the coming months on that set up

00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:18,950
your team synchronization with your IDP

00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:23,270
and understand access roles so open

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:25,940
source there are two ways they to think

00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:28,190
about open source and in my opinion it's

00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:30,770
not a religious debate I like both sides

00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:32,990
have a equally good argument on this I

00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:36,799
see two core ways to set it up in an

00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:38,570
enterprise as specifically when you're

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,700
in the cloud right because open source

00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:42,500
and on server that doesn't really mean

00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,600
anything because there's no community in

00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,309
there for that so that's more like inner

00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,040
source but you could create one org

00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:50,660
which is your brand where all of your SS

00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,309
projects are going to be so again you

00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:54,500
have an enterprise account but you have

00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:56,929
one org that it's gonna be your branded

00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:00,440
OSS org like all of the projects that

00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:03,200
wanna be OSS need to be there so that's

00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:06,950
one path that path actually I've seen it

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,679
be extremely successful and scale very

00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:11,240
well for the most part then there's

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,590
another one that you could utilize to

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,960
wishes know like I don't want that

00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:17,030
central management I want to just say I

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,220
have an org I want to use put a public

00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:20,990
repo so if I have five orgs and I have

00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,730
five public repos

00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:24,710
for open source then I have 500 words

00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:27,170
and 500 dribbles it could actually work

00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:29,600
as well there you know there are ways

00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:33,530
that you could add the org level say you

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:35,600
know repo admins can not get do not have

00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:37,400
the ability to take a project public

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,740
they need to pass through the org owner

00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,630
so there's ways to actually do that the

00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:44,480
right way the thing that I have found is

00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:47,270
to kind of items that become interesting

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,190
over here one is that once you have a

00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:53,270
lot of words this system starts getting

00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:55,309
a little bit not as systemic as it

00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:58,309
should be and number two the customer

00:24:55,309 --> 00:25:01,220
itself and so being going through a lot

00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:02,929
of brands of your company to be able to

00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,840
enter interact with your company and

00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:07,700
some people are good with branding their

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,130
open-source repos and stuff some people

00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:12,080
or their organizations some people are

00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:14,630
not and things like that so if you ask

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,400
me the one with the hearts is usually

00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,990
the one that I recommend but you know

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,090
I'm perfectly fine in the sunshine as

00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:23,480
well do I get burned from not having her

00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:28,340
but so the other thing that we seen more

00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:30,350
and more is the the ability to actually

00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,300
have a program that allows you to scale

00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:35,030
open source in an enterprise and that's

00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:36,710
usually call the Osmo office and in fact

00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:38,960
in the flight here I was reading an

00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:40,840
article and that's what I just put I had

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,880
to change the slide and the fly but

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,670
which you know there was a city net

00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,290
article where as a person or a company

00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,850
that is trying to standardize and get

00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:52,340
that company to embrace open-source a

00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,900
lot more and we see that a lot and the

00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,700
only way that they were able to make it

00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,400
successful is by actually having a

00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,750
program office for it so if you're in an

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,210
enterprise and you don't have a program

00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:04,660
office and you when I use and both

00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:07,010
consume and contribute to open source

00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:09,679
think about creating a program surface

00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:12,290
on it Jeff Macke Hoffer from github is

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,630
here he used to run the off program

00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:16,370
office at Microsoft yes a ton of

00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:18,950
information how to take a company that

00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:21,230
many people thought that hated

00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,780
open-source to what it is today which is

00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:27,500
one of the biggest contributors of

00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:29,210
open-source so and then the last thing

00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,880
is kind of what open source are you

00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:33,500
using right so right now I'm just

00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,800
showing over here some of the org

00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,600
insights

00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,850
the open source that you using but

00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,770
another thing is a kind of figuring out

00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:43,230
what you have and this is not actually

00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:45,480
the long-term right view for what your

00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:48,210
hope should be providing but it's kind

00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,700
of like the closest thing that we have

00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:52,350
but it's a dual thing is what open

00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,600
source are you using I was everything

00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:57,540
that is being open source and being able

00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,040
to actually figure out you know what how

00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,330
can you improve on both sides of the

00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,430
equation

00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:04,230
so kind of be thinking about that

00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,870
there's a lot more EPS I wanted to give

00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:08,460
you to be able to do that effectively

00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:09,840
but if you want to increase open source

00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,580
have enough installed open source

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,770
program office and then figure out

00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:15,840
exactly how much you're consuming how

00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:18,780
much you're actually contributing as

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,580
well so that's that and we only have

00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:26,370
eight minutes so time goes by fast so I

00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:29,070
go faster so inner source so we have we

00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:30,360
announced internal repos today so the

00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:32,130
way I wanted to think about it in the

00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,080
cloud today if you were using github

00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:36,240
Enterprise Cloud you had only two

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,950
visibility private or you had public

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,340
public means open source everyone can

00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,710
see it

00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:43,020
there was nothing like Shopify said we

00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:44,400
want to be open by default there was no

00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,200
way for them to do that unless they

00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,910
hacked everything around it by creating

00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,820
this team and then having everyone in a

00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:52,770
repo on it and all of that so we what

00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,270
we're doing right now is enabling every

00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:56,580
company that wants to do open by default

00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:58,200
to do that but you're saying you know

00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,880
what every repo that you get started

00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,440
especially frameworks and things like

00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,000
that should be internal by default and

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,010
that means everyone in your enterprise

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,230
can see it you don't need to add them as

00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:10,170
members or anything like that you that

00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:11,850
person can fork the repo can contribute

00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:13,410
pull request if that person leads the

00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:15,360
company we delete the fork from their

00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:17,100
personal account so everything kind of

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,750
is covered on it but this is kind of the

00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:21,810
foundation of what we calling inner

00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:24,480
source an inner source at scale at a

00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:26,370
company a lot more plan on this area so

00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,530
we're super excited to actually take the

00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:32,340
first step towards it in our cloud

00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:35,090
product today one thing that I did go

00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:37,350
over their mash incentives to code reuse

00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:39,870
we've seen a lot of companies say we're

00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:41,820
open by default but they their culture

00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:43,920
does not incentivize at all meaning me a

00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:46,770
developer will get paid more if I don't

00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,850
reuse that if I would reuse right so you

00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,630
do have to think a little bit about

00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:50,580
culture

00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:52,290
when it comes to inner sourcing so you

00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,640
just don't think about it as okay we

00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:58,230
haven't turned our rebus not everything

00:28:53,640 --> 00:29:01,200
is gravy so and then the other thing is

00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:03,630
organization insights and this well this

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,270
allows you to do it's kind of understand

00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:08,670
you know many people by github in order

00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:12,150
to transform right like github is not

00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:13,590
really just a git repository you know

00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,450
management there's plenty of them out

00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,010
there and to tell you to if you helped

00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,600
Enterprise a premium product so if

00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:19,890
you're gonna compare the pricing we're

00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,810
not even gonna be close to some of the

00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:24,480
people just offering get hosting so

00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:26,910
we're really a platform you know in this

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,640
planet scale and it but it's a really a

00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:31,830
cloud I'm sorry a collaboration platform

00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:35,340
at the end that offers significantly

00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:37,560
more than just raw SCM so many people

00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,060
when they adopt github what they want to

00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,650
see is a transformation of their

00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:43,020
practices there's a set of them that

00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:45,300
don't do code reviews for example and

00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:47,400
the one I or do them in only two teams

00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,960
and they want to kind of say everyone

00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,090
should be using them and this is the way

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,250
kind of going forward you know pull

00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:54,990
request code reviews and all of that so

00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:57,420
this allows you to actually get insights

00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:58,740
on it another thing that we've been very

00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:01,380
surprised by how people are thinking

00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:03,150
about is top languages that across all

00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,670
of the repos they use so what this

00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:06,930
allows you to do is say you know what

00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:09,510
there's some people actually using rust

00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:11,540
or Russ is gaining traction in my

00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:14,130
organization and she probably hire more

00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:16,680
Ross developers right like as you get

00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:18,120
ahead of that talent curve as much as

00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,500
possible so if they leave the company I

00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,320
could still you know management

00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:24,210
applications so so from an in resource

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,360
perspective please use that internal

00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:29,160
brief of visibility think about humans

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,350
like incentives all of us do they were

00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:34,140
motivated on both intrinsic and on

00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:36,690
intrinsic ways and then forced a foster

00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:38,220
internal communities and then understand

00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:40,980
how everything is getting used from a

00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:43,230
github perspective so last thing

00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:46,020
actually two more things security and

00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:48,500
compliance I talked a little bit about

00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:50,880
the admin Center at the enterprise level

00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,950
there is a feature there that is pretty

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,900
powerful which is hooks so you could

00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:57,120
actually end up subscribing to hooks and

00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:59,790
get notified about events across all of

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,850
your organizations so now you don't have

00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:03,350
to have now one app is installed

00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:04,940
in each one of them you don't have to

00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:07,400
configure every time you set up an org

00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:08,690
to actually you know be able to receive

00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,580
those hooks you could just do it at the

00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:12,500
enterprise level collect that data

00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,210
eventually we'll hook up that with

00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,210
actions and allows you to actually do

00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:18,289
something from an LC LC perspective

00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:20,809
enforce policy from that central

00:31:18,289 --> 00:31:22,429
location that admin Center and then it

00:31:20,809 --> 00:31:24,799
allows you to see all other people as

00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:26,419
well another feature that was not

00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,820
announced you didn't see it in there but

00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:32,059
it's also new and we're very excited

00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:34,309
about it is our audit log API we added

00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:36,169
this mainly for those cyber teams and

00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:38,240
those compliance scenarios so now you're

00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:40,010
gonna have an API against cloud that

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,590
it's going to give you a bunch of rich

00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:45,049
data about the events that happen within

00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:48,320
an organization and we are a lot of

00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:49,700
metadata there so we're gonna publish a

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,929
little bit more and sort of best

00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,600
practices some how you should be

00:31:50,929 --> 00:31:54,980
thinking about that but you know monitor

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,380
you're out of luck that's a good

00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,700
practice new API would last metadata is

00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,520
an announcement that we made today

00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:03,110
and then alert and have a remediation

00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,970
plan when you have alert so if someone

00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:07,909
you know and you see some activity

00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:10,760
sometimes that someone use let's say a

00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:12,470
path against a repo and they downloaded

00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,000
it and then you know 20 seconds later

00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:15,500
they try to download all the repos in

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,850
your organization like you should be

00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,919
able to detect that very quickly and

00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:20,919
figured out a way to remediate in fact

00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:25,760
we also release as far the enterprise

00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:28,309
work an API to revoke a path anytime you

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,929
see it being used in a way that is

00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:31,850
malicious and we have a way now to

00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:33,530
disable that path across and you know

00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:36,169
all of the repos in your organization as

00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:39,559
one so play around with this give us

00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:41,210
feedback we also talked a little bit

00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:43,730
about from a security perspective about

00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:47,020
dependencies and getting inside in those

00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:49,370
dependencies making use of kind of

00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,630
automatic fixes and all of that you know

00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:52,669
you could go with why github provides

00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:55,460
you we have two great partners in white

00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:56,900
shirts and sneak as well that can you

00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,950
know are actually be able to provide a

00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,990
little bit more security on your

00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:01,850
dependency management so but the biggest

00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:03,679
thing for me to stress on that is get

00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:05,659
clean and stay clean that's one of the

00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,940
things that enterprises struggle I with

00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:10,840
that is super important as you go

00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:15,560
forward and you want to scale it across

00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:17,030
then the last things is get out server I

00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,860
do have a couple of slides on this what

00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:22,490
I would tell you is our appliance set

00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:25,340
loves loves this Kyle like it consumes

00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:26,960
them like incredibly incredible amounts

00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,490
of time so you're gonna be resource

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,350
constrained at the appliance at any

00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:33,560
point it's probably gonna be your desk

00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:36,470
so buy the best SSDs that you could buy

00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:38,330
at this moment or deploy to the cloud

00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:39,770
you know cloud providers usually start

00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:42,260
getting better and better about their

00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:46,220
SOC throughput it allows you to actually

00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:47,900
scale as well but this guy oh so if you

00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,490
if you have ideal of enterprise server

00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,380
this guy oh it's gonna be the best thing

00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:53,960
don't make your developers actually have

00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:57,230
slow experiences give up invest a lot of

00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,910
you know sweat and tears on actually

00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:01,850
being the most performant you know

00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:04,130
application out there and you know it's

00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:05,690
because in without this you're not gonna

00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:07,700
be able to provide that experience to

00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:09,020
your developers internally so please buy

00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:12,020
good as as these they're not that

00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:13,190
expensive so and then take advantage of

00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,840
our build team monitor and are learning

00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:17,360
a lot of people don't know that we have

00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,010
built-in monitor in the appliance and

00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,419
then end up doing all of these things

00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:22,850
are redundant so please take advantage

00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:24,830
with those help dogs and do the right

00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:27,140
thing there and then the last thing is

00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:29,000
high availability github for the

00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:31,399
majority of the enter process it cannot

00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,159
be down like an hour down of github

00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:37,130
means at times millions of dollars in

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:40,429
developer spend you know one of one of

00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:42,800
our customer has 70,000 you know users

00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:44,360
on one of these appliances so it cannot

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,060
be down high availability is super

00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,649
important so there's two stages on that

00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:50,149
one of them is nothing to do with high

00:34:48,649 --> 00:34:52,790
availability but it's like you have a

00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:54,320
set of backups please test those backups

00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:56,720
as well so when the funny event happens

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,280
you have a way to have a run book and be

00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,080
able to restore that and all of that

00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,730
quarterly is perfect if you don't like

00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,790
quarterly you know twice a year is good

00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:06,770
too or use our high ability set up to

00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,880
protect against software crashes and

00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:10,070
anything that could happen within the

00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,470
appliance and understand how to actually

00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:14,270
do that fell over that's what we see the

00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:16,580
moons at times for our successful

00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:18,830
customers is how to actually do a highly

00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:21,260
ability with one active you know and one

00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:22,940
that is just on standby it's not really

00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,440
active active but you know since time by

00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:26,900
you have to do a couple of other things

00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,860
and then bring that off at the same time

00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,120
it uses replication

00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,770
pretty proud of the work there we need

00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,960
to continue to improve that we're never

00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:36,870
done with those type of features and we

00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,230
are out of time so thank you so much for

00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,000
everything

00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:41,730
so it's 35 minutes I walked you through

00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,850
a lot of it happy to talk to you after

00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:46,610
about anything that is top of mind for

00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:49,110
you so thanks

00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:57,679
[Applause]

00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:57,679
