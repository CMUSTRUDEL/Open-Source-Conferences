Skyscanner practice Continuous Deployment wherever possible and have a robust deployment system in place – but it’s not been easy and there’s been plenty of bumps and unintended consequences along the way. Tools that work at a smaller scale become strategic roadblocks as you try to move your team into a faster and safer path to production. Stuart will hope to dispel the myth that you need to be "all-in" from the start and walk through how Skyscanner got to where they are, one step and one transition at a time.
