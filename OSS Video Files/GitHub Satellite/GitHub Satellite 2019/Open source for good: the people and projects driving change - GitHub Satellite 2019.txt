Title: Open source for good: the people and projects driving change - GitHub Satellite 2019
Publication date: 2019-05-29
Playlist: GitHub Satellite 2019
Description: 
	Presented by Admas Kanyagia, Senior Director of Social Impact, GitHub
Catherine Stihler, CEO, Open Knowledge Foundation
Hong Phuc Dang, Founder, FOSSASIA

As we strive to make progress on looming social issues like class divides, climate change, and access to education, innovation is key. New technologies are one of the most effective ways we can manage the complexity of these problems—bringing together institutions, developers, and companies to build collaborative open source solutions—and many of them are being built on GitHub.

In this session you’ll hear from people who are working at the intersection of social change and open source technology and walk away inspired by their stories of impact on some of the most important issues of our time.

my name is at Moscone yoga I lead the

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,780
social impact team at github and the

00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:51,750
mission of the social impact team is to

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,689
activate github people product and

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,670
platform to address the pervasive and

00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:57,689
persistent social issues that we see in

00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,879
the world around us

00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:02,549
it was quite telling in this morning's

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,769
keynote how not highlighted the great

00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:06,930
incredible work of Katie Beaumont and

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,210
the larger team in discovering the black

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,009
hole image and that is the kind of work

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,850
and opportunity that open-source can

00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:14,940
afford us

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:18,000
we know that collaboration we know that

00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:20,430
the multiple perspectives and really the

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,290
ingenuity and energy of developers and

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,780
others who are on the platform are

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,940
actually being used to address really

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,010
projects that have incredible social

00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,620
purpose for the world that we see today

00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,270
and so that is what today's conversation

00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,420
is about and thank you all for joining

influential reports and opinions calling

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,450
for libraries to be included in the

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,630
copyright exemptions that we talked

00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,000

Katherine and her perspective to join us

00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:30,870
today welcome Katherine so I invited the

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,640
panelists to spend a few minutes just

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,560
sharing about their work before we dive

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:40,260
into the discussion so I'll hand it off

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:42,750
to Katherine next so thank you at mass

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,150
and thank you to all of you for being

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,190
here today and it's a it's quite bizarre

00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,810
as the first time I've never stood in

00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,940
the European elections I wanted to share

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,459
a story with you my husband is American

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,470
and he became a British citizen just

00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:56,730
last year and so the irony being is this

00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,680
is the first time my husband has ever

00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,150
had the vote in a in an election in

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,489
Britain and it's the first time I've

00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,350
never stood in that election but anyway

00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:05,880
he voted so that's a good thing and I

00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:08,640
think as Maria Chuck has said about

00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,459
voting how important all is but my route

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,320
into understanding about open source was

00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,359
really through copyright reform as

00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,609
you've touched upon and it was through

00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:19,470
that experience however hard that was

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:21,000
that got me involved in open knowledge

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,979
and when the opportunity came along to

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,140
come in run open knowledge I thought it

00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:27,539
was a perfect fit because we really

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:30,660
stand at this crossroads between either

00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:32,680
a private proprietary future where only

00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,020
knowledge is accessible to those who can

00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,360
pay and who can afford or we keep

00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:40,509
fighting for an open future where we

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,280
want it to be fear free and open for us

00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:45,400
all that open world that we all desire

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,500
and I think as I reflect upon this and

00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,000
the politics around that I think it's

00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,639
very timely to come and talk about the

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,500
benefits of open source so if we look at

00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:55,090
my next slide we've got kind of three

00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,889
slides here if that's okay if some

00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,270
compute that one just to kind of see

00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:01,570
about what open knowledge is we

00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:03,340
celebrated 15 years on Monday so we're

00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,960
so happy that that's that that's the

00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,160
case why don't I've got a button to and

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,169
I sorry there we go

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,030
I didn't politic somebody than that for

00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:15,070
me but I've got to do that and but

00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:17,139
anyway here we go but our mission is an

00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,599
open world where all non personal

00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:22,150
information is open free for everyone to

00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:23,650
use build on and share and also

00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,289
importantly we're creators and

00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:29,110
innovators are fairly recognized and

00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:31,000
rewarded and are three strands of focus

00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,560
that we're looking at just now are in

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,090
the relatable and that's something I

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,090
think we will talk a little bit about on

00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:38,560
health access to medicine on education

00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,750
and that brings in the copyright work

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,389
that I've worked on about open access as

00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:45,220
well and then on and work about jobs and

00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:47,169
inequality because our world is more

00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:50,080
unequal than ever before and we've got

00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:51,789
to do something about that and then we

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,960
look at kind of three of you asked to

00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:55,210
give kind of three things that we've

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,639
been looking at and one of those is

00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,560
certainly what open knowledge was

00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:00,669
founded upon and which the Roofus

00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,650
doctorate of his who was the

00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:04,750
founder of all / knowledge to find the

00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:06,430
open definition that used everywhere and

00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,830
I'm so proud that it's open knowledge

00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:11,169
that led that then we look at seek on

00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,150
that platform that allows all of the

00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:14,139
open data that could be out there onto

00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,509
something that can actually be

00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:18,669
translatable very important and then our

00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:21,039
new work on frictionless data which is

00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:23,099
described to me is what what shipping

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,599
containers aren't the shipping industry

00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:27,039
frictionless data is to the data world

00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:29,229
and it's some so proud to be part of our

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,270
organization working at the cutting edge

00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:32,860
of that so I'm really looking forward to

00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:35,020
the conversation I've all certainly not

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,789
hold this microphone and I'm gonna hand

00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,199
back to add Mercy's gonna introduce your

00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:39,340
next speaker so thank you very much for

00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,669
listening over to admira's

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,669
thank you

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,410
so it's interesting to have two mics at

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,990
once so I'll give this back to you

00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:57,699
Catherine I will introduce hung next to

00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:59,620
speak about Foss Asia hello

00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:06,160
I'm not doing politics I always have to

00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:09,069
click myself so I thought that I will

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:14,979
start to tell you about how I got into

00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:18,009
open source in 2007 my friend had me

00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:23,289
install Ubuntu to replace windows SP

00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:24,910
editor also begin me no user ID really

00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:27,280
light it in a way that you don't get

00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:31,150
constant update all the time and you

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,860
don't get virus alert every day and I

00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,770
love the fact that you can download

00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:38,050
software from your terminal by typing of

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:40,150
your command line so that really got me

00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:43,569
excited like and then I started to

00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:45,370
participate in the local Linux user

00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:48,310
group get together almost every month

00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:51,669
when I met amazing free software

00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:53,800
contributor who taught me how to how to

00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:56,800
drive light on how to use a very good

00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:00,460
software project in scale how the

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:03,669
community works and many more but it was

00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:06,550
then the software that got me inspired

00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:10,300
I was really surprised how a person

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:13,300
could contribute voluntarily into one

00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,860
project over 15 20 years until so

00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,020
excited about it

00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:20,500
how so passionate about what he is doing

00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:21,460
I feel that the best thing that could

00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,770
happen to anyone

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,479
at least to me is that the ability to be

00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,800
able to work on something that you love

00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:30,190
and be happy about it

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,860
yeah so what I try to say is it's the

00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,779
people the community that taught me to

00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:38,140
in opens the door for me to open source

00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:40,539
and then in 2009 I founded force Asia

00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:44,740
together with my partner Mario Bellini

00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:47,079
who always is also here today for Asia

00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,730
is the community of people from

00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:52,630
everywhere who want to make a better

00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:54,670
future with open technologies some of

00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,949
the core activity of force Asia we

00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:59,589
develop software and hardware a drug

00:08:56,949 --> 00:09:02,459
education program organize events

00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:07,839
throughout Asia we have a very active

00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:09,940
online community on Gita over 3,000

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,459
members so you can just go in as any

00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:15,640
question somebody will be there to to

00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:17,320
answer these are a few for Asia project

00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,050
developed by the community

00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,750
everything hosted on github I just

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:25,690
cannot say lie of a few things on the

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:28,630
list sue CAI basically an alternative to

00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:32,589
Alexa echo or Google home but if you

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:34,660
entirely on open source um you can

00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:38,680
actually build your own speaker the

00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:40,720
kinetics available on github and install

00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,180
the application on your local machine

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:52,660
and make your own personal assistant and

00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:55,150
I can I believe that everyone here knows

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:58,750
Eventbrite you need a ticket to get to

00:09:55,150 --> 00:10:01,050
this event rain event yay is a solution

00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,520
open source solution that offers similar

00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:07,570
functionalities and features exactly

00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:09,430
like Eventbrite we are using it also to

00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:11,699
organize our own conference next flower

00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:13,750
is using it and I hope that github

00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:15,250
consider to try out this solution

00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,579
because a people by the open-source

00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:24,970
community and it hosted on your platform

00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:26,500
github pocket Sian laughs we started a

00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:29,620
project a few years ago they said our

00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:32,170
first open hardware project the aim of

00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,930
the project is to make Sian affordable

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:37,750
and accessible to people in developing

00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:40,449
country basically it's a multifunctional

00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,970
device including of Scylla scarf

00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:45,190
we're generating a logic analyzer

00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:47,470
multimeter and many more I also have the

00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,959
product here today but I'm gonna pass it

I want to mention this project every

00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:05,020
season of code here we bring in over 600

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,210
new user to

00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:10,000
you know basically we teach young

00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:11,500
developer how to use git and github to

Asia mentor everything happened online

00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:23,710
via github and the communication and

00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:27,700
everything on guitar this is a picture

00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:30,130

if you are around later know the website

00:11:50,590 --> 00:12:03,940
open text submit dotnet I think that's

00:11:53,710 --> 00:12:05,970
all I have just get set up for our panel

00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,970
discussion

00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:11,470
and thank you both for for sharing a

00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,850
high-level overview of your work I think

00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:16,089
that's always helpful to set some

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:18,970
context for our discussion so my first

00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:21,069
question to this esteemed panel is what

00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,079
are the barriers and challenges that you

00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:28,029
face every day in your open source for

00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:30,309
good work Katherine would you start so I

00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:32,639
think it's about what we said before

00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:35,800
I've masturbated relatability and

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,269
understanding and I think that with

00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,089
people who understand they're taking

00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:42,399
that technically able it's great but for

00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:44,079
those that are not it is something that

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,170
we have to translate and that's why

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,850
looking at projects and giving examples

00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,589
and storytelling around some of the

00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,959
great work that happens it's really

00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:55,870
important moving forward so I think it

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:59,530
is about understanding relatability how

00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:01,350
what would you say so I would say

00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:04,589
[Music]

00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:07,569
sustainability and scale up our check I

00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:09,220
understand any of us here contribute to

00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:11,649
open source project but it's always the

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:14,290
question how you can actually scale up

00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:16,660
the development how you can sustain your

00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:19,420
community it's not easy to get

00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:21,879
individual who work from everywhere

00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:25,449
getting together in one community and

00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:27,610
follow a common goal or common practices

00:13:25,449 --> 00:13:30,129
and it's always the charge I mean

00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:33,509
challenging for us at Faust Asia so we

00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:35,800
develop common guidelines and also

00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:38,980
recommended best practices for our

00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,929
developers so that we able to stay on

00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:44,589
all on track and carefully moving

00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:46,709
forward so but I would say the major

00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:50,069
challenge of open source project is

00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:52,899
scaling of the project and the community

00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:54,189
yeah and you know interesting time right

00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:56,529
now with our announcement today about

00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:57,939
github sponsors and I think one thing

00:13:56,529 --> 00:13:59,620
that we're really thinking about is how

00:13:57,939 --> 00:14:01,899
does it apply to projects like this that

00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:04,870
have some social good and social purpose

00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:06,220
and the world around us yeah my next

00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,110
question for you both is what are the

00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,850
opportunities what opportunities do you

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,100
see in the landscape that will help

00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:17,840
deepen and amplify the impact of your

00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:20,420
work would you start yes I can say so

00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:23,390
there's a lot of activities in open

00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:26,600
source for insane because of open source

00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:28,940
we can learn from the best people the

00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,190
brightest my of all the amazing project

00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:34,130
and can hope you know contribute a lot

00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:36,529
in the ecosystem how you get people

00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:39,620
allow people to to work on projects

00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:42,350
together and another opportunity in the

00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,420
open source world AI CD to a company

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,640
cooperation enterprises started to

00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:50,089
embrace open source a lot like Microsoft

00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,950
released so many amazing tools and the

00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:54,230
company that I work with solando is a

00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,610
fashion store but we develop so many our

00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,160
software and released so many software

00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,500
in open source so that the ecosystem

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,890
getting better and better and is it a

00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:05,570
great opportunity for open source

00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:07,970
Catherine thank you I think that there's

00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:10,730
huge amounts of opportunity and I think

00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:12,230
that when you look at C from a policy

00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,260
perspective I could just touch upon that

00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:17,810
and one thing that maybe can so sooo

00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,700
boring but actually is so important is

00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:21,830
in public procurement if you look at

00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,110
your public procurement if you can get

00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:26,270
open source as just the standard way

00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,680
that business is done then the

00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,630
opportunity and the innovation the

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,690
creativity you can get from that will be

00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:35,140
I think a fantastic opportunity but more

00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:37,970
than that I think if you think about how

00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:40,190
creativity collaboration the whole

00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:42,050
innovation piece is at the center of

00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:46,070
what open source I think is all about

00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:48,620
and the more people that we can convince

00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,870
the better and I think that's something

00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,910
we're as someone who's quite new to the

00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,310
open world but who is passionate about

00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,410
it but maybe not is technical as many of

00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:59,750
you are in this room I think that if we

00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:03,050
can bring build that bridge between the

00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,850
tech and the human side of things we

00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,800
were able to be more relatable it'll be

00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,720
able to be delivered better and I'll be

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,420
a force for good to fight for an open

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,550
world I want to see as a reality not as

00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,650
something that is just envisioned but

00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:18,750
actually the reality of an open a vote

00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:20,610
of an open place in an open world

00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,220
I also wanted to emphasize what

00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:25,110
Katherine just said I would like to call

00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,540
out for the organization like Open

00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:30,420
Knowledge Foundation Open Source

00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:33,000
Initiative and many more development

00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:36,810
cooperation that try to educate people

00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,689
in lay open sort adoption and policy so

00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:44,699
Dre work by the way thank you very much

00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:45,990
for your work you know I'd love to talk

00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,399
a little bit about something that you

00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:50,069
just first brought up you've talked

00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:52,610
about policy and you talked a little bit

00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:55,230
about this idea of the ecosystem as well

00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:57,060
so as we think about different pieces of

00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:59,550
that ecosystem you know one that I'm

00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:02,279
particularly interested is nonprofits

00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:05,010
not nongovernmental organizations as

00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:06,510
well as government itself what would be

00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,949
more helpful in your work with

00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:10,500
government you talked about procurement

00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:12,030
specifically but as you think about you

00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,949
know maybe how you can start and talk

00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,539
about your work with UNESCO what has

00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:18,870
been helpful in really driving

00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:21,030
open-source contribution adoption etc

00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:24,569
with supporting organizations like that

00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:27,569
and I think the advantage of the UNESCO

00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:32,280
is it is a global organization so it has

00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:35,750
a very wide reach to to the world to the

00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:40,500
community and we work with UNESCO on

00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:42,600
different hackathons I an event where we

00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,720
educate people they also have their own

00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,549
force initiative within the UN and we've

00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,620
been working with them life for the past

00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:52,740
four years and help them to bring

00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:57,150
open-source education to country in

00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:59,909
Southeast Asia yeah so yeah so but it's

00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:02,659
definitely a benefit show for also from

00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:04,950
community to work with this global

00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:08,190
organization you know to improve the

00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:10,530
reach and impact I completely I think

00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:12,510
use the whole aspect of the global

00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:15,480
nature I mean I manage a team know

00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:17,159
remotely from Mexico City Singapore and

00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,020
and when I say that does from my study

00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:20,549
in Dunfermline in Scotland and people

00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,080
are kind of like that's quite an amazing

00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:23,669
thing you can do that you can do that

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,360
because the technology allows your know

00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:28,280
able to do that but equally we

00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,110
a community over 15 years which is

00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,420
global we've got people that we knew

00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:34,400
across the world this is something that

00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:36,440
is of great benefit when we're putting

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,940
forward our vision of this open world

00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,880
were your open sources the heart of that

00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:43,610
as well but I think that if you're

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,770
asking us about where does this go to

00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:47,720
how does it work fundamentally it is

00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:49,160
this thing about how do we make it

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,230
relatable how do we get people to

00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,600
understand we've had developed a school

00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,730
of data about data literacy but it's

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,680
just it's people that say come to our

00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:00,470
website the people who would come anyway

00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,750
how do we get to people who might not

00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:04,370
see this but needless in terms of where

00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,380
the future rests because we knew our

00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:08,000
kids at the moment I've got a 13 year

00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,160
old and a 7 year old and we know that

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,080
boys it's something like one it's 80% of

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,390
the jobs aren't create they will be

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,830
doing aren't created yet and this is

00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:17,660
something I don't know if this ever

00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:20,120
happened before we're in this situation

00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:22,250
where the uncertainty is an opportunity

00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,200
but it's also uncertainty and for many

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,970
people can go this to ways of being a

00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,720
more closed or a more open future and we

00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,720
have to keep it open

00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:35,120
great thank you for those perspectives

00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:37,070
one other question I have is the role of

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,570
companies like github and open source

00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,400
companies like github so you talked a

00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:42,290
little bit about though advantages we

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,600
see is that the ecosystem is maturing

00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:45,890
there's more resources is more language

00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,660
but we still have far to go

00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:50,450
we still have a lot to go in terms of

00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:53,980
relatability and accessibility but what

00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,980
could companies like github do to help

00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:58,580
keep the conversation going

00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,540
I mean I you're doing I mean this is a

00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:02,930
fantastic event

00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:07,250
you've got people I mean I got to know

00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:08,870
github because of coffee and so the

00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,700
great work that you do and I think this

00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:12,890
is something for you you have a role to

00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,300
play whether you know how you do that is

00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:16,820
another question but I think the key

00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,710
thing is how'd you get reach beyond your

00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:20,120
key kind of challenges how we're going

00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,130
to get that relate ability to

00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,070
communities that are non-traditional to

00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:28,880
what you've used to been dealing with

00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:31,680
yeah so I think Kim Huff is constantly

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,110
doing amazing thing I was so excited

00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:36,060
the sponsor feature that you just

00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:39,180
announced today we're just talking about

00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:41,280
the challenges which is slightly so the

00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:43,710
lack of resources in open source project

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,990
and community so if anyone here would

00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,390
like to support Asia community go and

00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:52,140
donate to our repository this is a very

00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:54,660
good idea and again I also see that

00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,730
organized event like this an opportunity

00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:01,280
to bring people together to network how

00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:04,500
many fourth Asia contributors are here

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,270
yeah over there over there yeah so thank

00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,550
you you know for bringing us together I

00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:11,820
think we have like nine ten people here

00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:14,610
today who come from our community and I

00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:16,200
also say that you constantly listen to

00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:19,410
to the developers you always have

00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,470
continual conversation what can you make

00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:25,020
better for the community which is

00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:26,880
critical and if I talk on behalf of post

00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,980
Asia I would say of course we want to

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,260
scale up our project like wholly we want

00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:33,450
not only to reach the people from

00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,010
particular region but everywhere that

00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,810
could be raised if we can work together

00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,790
we'll get up on that to teach more

00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:40,980
people about it and contribute to

00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:44,340
various open source project not only of

00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:50,010
course Asia but in our organization in

00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:51,780
the ecosystem an incredible vision so

00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:54,630
one one thing that you both talked about

00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,920
is this idea of global communities and I

00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:58,800
think it's something that we think a lot

00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:01,080
about as we see the ecosystem maturing

00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,240
as we see opportunities that incredible

00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,920
visual that nacho during his keynote

00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,050
about really that open source

00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,520
contributions on github come from most

00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:11,670
of them really come from outside of the

00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:13,440
US but part of that conversation is

00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:15,810
really about inclusion and what does

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,180
inclusion really look like in a global

00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:20,340
from a global context and so what are

00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:22,470
some of the ways in which you know

00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,150
you've thought been very thoughtful and

00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,890
intentional about inclusion in your

00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:27,450
open-source work because I think those

00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:29,190
kinds of best practice to this could be

00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:31,640
something that we can share even much

00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,640
more widely

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:38,659
I can say something so inclusion so it's

00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:41,750
I think the key thing to build it to

00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:44,570
building an inclusive community a to

00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:47,450
Trier's a very opening and welcoming

00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:49,940
culture for the community and this is

00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:52,669
not easy at all we have people come from

00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:55,629
various background in some time I feel a

00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:58,700
little bit uncomfortable by some of the

00:22:55,629 --> 00:23:00,590
reaction of maintained nerds or

00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,370
developers online you know people get

00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:03,799
sometimes

00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:05,029
impatient when new joinee are getting on

00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:08,299
board is false Asia

00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:11,090
we'd really try our best to to inform

00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:13,490
the community a lot of conflict happened

00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:15,470
because of misunderstanding people are

00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:19,159
not aware that we all come from

00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:21,649
different backgrounds and then some

00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:24,710
people would get offended when they just

00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:26,899
because we don't see each other in a way

00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:29,080
that every how everyone come from a

00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:31,509
different background so we constantly

00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,340
communicate this message to our

00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:36,950
community and try to work together with

00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:39,409
many different organizations so I think

00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:44,149
the thing that we did very well during

00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:46,940
the past video we develop a community at

00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:50,059
the same time we constantly look out for

00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:55,580
lesson good practices and assemble for

00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:57,230
organization like DPN community kinome

00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:59,870
foundation so we actually like

00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:01,490
collaborate with different open sort of

00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:05,259
around the world to learn what is the

00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:07,879
best way to draw the community and

00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:09,830
talking about inclusion I believe that

00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:12,529
it is also somebody in the audience

00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:14,659
cooking on an open source diversity here

00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:18,080
in Berlin and it's like initiative like

00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:20,809
this we always Park of this and we train

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,970
and try to to connect with people and

00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:24,889
another thing about in English learners

00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:28,009
that I want to mention so open source it

00:24:24,889 --> 00:24:29,860
not only about software developers of

00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:33,440
course you add the most important people

00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:35,389
but in order to be an open-source

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,230
or to be a project we also need people

00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:39,480
who can't

00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:41,310
promote the project who can tell us who

00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,680
can do documentation and who can do

00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:45,840
design and may and many more yeah and

00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:49,140
this is something that we want to focus

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,270
on so we try to tell people that if you

00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,770
don't have the technical background or

00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:55,430
knowledge there's so many different ways

00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:58,590
that you can contribute to a project and

00:24:55,430 --> 00:25:03,210
we need to push more on this Eric's and

00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:05,250
I believe anything to add coming from a

00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:07,350
non-technical background myself is is

00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:09,570
interesting to come into and I have to

00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:13,140
be I mean it's been a real eye-opener

00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:14,880
kind of how Co collaborative I guess

00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,840
coming out of politics we're at the

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,180
moment it's not particularly

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,160
collaborative but coming to community

00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:22,530
where is community driven and it is

00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,330
about trying to do the best and to learn

00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:26,340
from each other and to share and to

00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:28,320
create that sense of being something

00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,540
bigger than just what you are working

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,490
you're hearing this and that is really

00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:34,920
powerful and I think actually open

00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:36,300
source it you know we talked about we

00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,400
talked a lot about collaboration in

00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,350
terms of innovation but actually this is

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,180
actually happening and I think that's a

00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:44,700
great strength because you've got the

00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:47,910
agility to look at things to develop

00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:50,190
things to react to issues that are

00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:53,280
pertinent that moment and to do some

00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:55,530
good which it would maybe take in policy

00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:57,150
terms years to do that and that's where

00:25:55,530 --> 00:26:00,000
the challenge I think the risk is that

00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:01,620
so many policymakers are just I think my

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,930
grades are seeing that I'm touching upon

00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:05,520
that are just so far behind what's the

00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:07,470
reality and by the time you meet the

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,120
policy is already whatever many years

00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:10,470
okay and this is going to be moving

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,210
forward I think one of the big

00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:14,490
challenges we face in terms of inclusion

00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:16,350
and community I think this is something

00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:18,720
which is a great advantage that you all

00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:21,020
have and I really do think in terms of

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,340
open knowledge foundation with their

00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:26,700
networking community out there it's

00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:28,320
something I want to tap into in a better

00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,920
and a more constructive way

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:34,140
the Mobe we've done that in the past

00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:36,930
interesting no absolutely I think that

00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:39,060
these best practices you know thinking

00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:41,100
about leveraging those this idea of like

00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:43,680
really valuing all different kinds of

00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,810
expertise being very intentional about

00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,100
community building I'd love to talk a

00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:49,769
little bit about community

00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,360
next so you know what has that been like

00:26:49,769 --> 00:26:52,710
I know you've only been at open

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,240
knowledge foundation for a short while

00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:56,370
but I'm sure you understand sort of the

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,500
history of community building over the

00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:00,299
past you know over the past ten years of

00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,769
the organization the you know Hong

00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:03,419
you've done this you know really

00:27:01,769 --> 00:27:05,429
grassroots effort in building

00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:09,149
communities you know what what does that

00:27:05,429 --> 00:27:10,799
journey really been like Catherine I

00:27:09,149 --> 00:27:13,080
think the whole thing about not being in

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,759
control I think the whole thing about

00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,950
the fact that the community goes out and

00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:19,139
does and grows and changes and develops

00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:22,559
and that's the creative sense of it and

00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:24,840
I also think I mean it's just I did a my

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:27,149
first week I did an article and the

00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,710
community in Brazil translated into

00:27:27,149 --> 00:27:30,570
Portuguese or something and I was like

00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:32,460
this is amazing and it was just this

00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:35,009
sense of being part of this there's a

00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,809
bigger world there's bigger picture that

00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:39,149
you can see and people relate to that

00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:41,490
and I think at the moment bit frankly

00:27:39,149 --> 00:27:44,250
the politics been so paralyzed and

00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:46,139
broken we have an opportunity to talk

00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:48,539
about this world that we want to see and

00:27:46,139 --> 00:27:50,340
we can do that through some of the the

00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:51,299
work that we're doing in terms of some

00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,700
of the project work there certainly

00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:56,429
you've been doing but also just in terms

00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,470
of what we see as the future so it's um

00:27:56,429 --> 00:27:59,970
I just feel so blessed that I've got a

00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:01,860
community out there this global and I

00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,809
can talk to people from all over the

00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:06,269
world across all these continents and we

00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:11,100
all share this common vision that's so

00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:14,100
powerful yeah so the lesson that I

00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:17,700
learned from the foster community the

00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:22,140
past ten years I think something got to

00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:24,630
do with empowerment yeah so we have

00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:28,440
I'm a developer of here who used to be

00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:30,630
the student and then become to be mentor

00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,669
of the neck project and also for Asia

00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:35,580
intern that kept together with very

00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:39,450
senior developers - sitting here so

00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:41,429
that's actually there is no hierarchy or

00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:44,039
barriers between the people in the

00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:45,740
community and what we try to achieve is

00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:48,059
in order to sustain the community

00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:50,730
constantly need to give the

00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:53,909
responsibility for the younger developer

00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:57,059
for for the younger generation so our

00:28:53,909 --> 00:29:00,419
student our interns move on to become

00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:02,340
mentor after some years and they tacked

00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:05,220
on the responsibilities to change

00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:07,740
younger people at the moment we own the

00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:09,980
work we also a mentor organization for

00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:13,559
google code-in which is the program for

00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:17,010
force for young student between 13 and

00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:20,010
17 years old that show them how to work

00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:22,440
and how to work open sort and contribute

00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:25,950
to the community in a very young age so

00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:29,639
I think another key is start with

00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:31,440
education yeah it's never too early or

00:29:29,639 --> 00:29:34,440
too late to learn something yes

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,000
empowerment and education are some that

00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:41,850
I believe is the key of drawing

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:45,149
community so my next question is how can

00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:47,970
developers or users or social scientists

00:29:45,149 --> 00:29:52,409
or scientists or others get engaged in

00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:55,260
your work well I always tell people we

00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:56,760
are on get help we also have a community

00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:59,279
on Guiteau

00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,590
there's so many projects under foster

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:04,440
you can check out the repository we

00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:06,720
actually constantly need help and I also

00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:10,350
pass around our products if you have any

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:13,409
ideas to help improve help to build the

00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:16,820
next open source closer no assistant or

00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:19,409
have to be a solution that can replace

00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:23,220
event price or you can start to you

00:30:19,409 --> 00:30:27,030
infirmed write for your own events

00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:28,740
I think you said something there about

00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:30,480
can ever be education about

00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,610
open-mindedness and I think that's

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,010
something that's really strong and you

00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:37,830
know being open-minded and being able to

00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:40,410
see the opportunity but I think you know

00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:42,410
in terms of sharing ideas of being there

00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:45,000
being out there being able to

00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:46,620
communicate we've got different ways

00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,470
that we can communicate different

00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:51,750
different and certainly different

00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:54,420
communities but certainly ways that you

00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:57,150
can give ideas and share that I think

00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:58,860
though that for the future I think that

00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:00,840
certainly from you know the only being

00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,670
that open knowledge for 14 weeks or it's

00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,890
just it's a start and it's a journey but

00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:06,720
I think for for us it's getting back to

00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:08,820
what we fundamentally are and that's

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,040
about open knowledge and somehow along

00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:14,580
the way we got caught up and the data to

00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:16,950
be which is part of our DNA but it but

00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,690
equally it's about knowledge and that's

00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,490
what you said as well it's knowledge

00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:23,400
that it's important as we move forward

00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:24,960
it's that it's somehow we kind of lost

00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,610
the whole thing about knowledge society

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,110
knowledge equality you know is somehow

00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:29,520
lost and some of the debates that we've

00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:31,530
been having we need to grab that back

00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,720
and see why that's important because

00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:36,690
that is them poem and that is what will

00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:39,060
take us forward and this is where open

00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:42,180
source is so important so I'm excited

00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:43,800
and I'm learning and it's always you've

00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,970
always learned I guarantee you know and

00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,390
that's the thing is to make sure people

00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:50,340
always have that opportunity to learn so

00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:53,400
I'm also curious when you ask us like

00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:55,320
what can get have new to the community I

00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,360
want to ask they're back to get up the

00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,820
question so this prepend know about open

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,160
sword for good what are the initiative

00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:04,980
at kickoff could you share a little bit

00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:07,050
with us happy - happy - and I think that

00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,910
you know part of the the work to date

00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,950
has really been about fostering

00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:13,770
conversations like this and and how do

00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:16,830
we start to build a narrative that open

00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:19,110
source is more than just about you know

00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:21,300
freedom of expression it's more than

00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:23,040
just about you know the opportunity for

00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:25,500
developers to contribute around you know

00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:28,410
you know programming languages that

00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:30,240
there is this bigger purpose towards the

00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:31,860
technology that many Aversa building

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,480
that has an impact in the real world

00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:36,320
around

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,570
now this is a completely new idea for us

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,700
I think that we are starting to see and

00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:42,980
it really came around after we started

00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:45,160
to see this incredible organic evolution

00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:47,300
of activity on the platform of

00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,610
individual developers who were

00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,470
developing or you know working with many

00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:53,390
others on code to address this

00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:55,850
particular issue that they saw in their

00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:57,410
community you know such as assistive

00:32:55,850 --> 00:33:00,230
technology because somebody and their

00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:02,930
family was disabled for example two

00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:04,880
large philanthropic organizations like

00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:06,440
the Gates Foundation who are using

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,320
open-source to expand financial

00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,510
inclusion for the world's poor and this

00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,100
was completely organic it's not specific

00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:14,780
outreach that we did but I think as

00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,600
those of us who are sitting in the

00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:19,130
social sector are starting to understand

00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:21,740
technology can be an incredible asset

00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:23,570
for social change and open source has a

00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,670
really incredible role to play in

00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:28,070
expanding technology for that use it

00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:30,020
lends itself actually really really well

00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:32,240
to addressing these issues because one

00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:34,460
it brings in diverse perspectives that

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,710
are truly global - it's based on

00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:38,150
collaboration the social problems that

00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:40,640
we see in the world around us are

00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:42,500
persistent there preserve a Civ they're

00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,840
not going to be solved by silver bullet

00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:47,810
solutions like we need and all of us

00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,520
hands on deck to be working on them and

00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:51,830
I think three-d-- really harness is this

00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:54,050
incredible creative energy that you know

00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:56,750
developers have that those are on the

00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:59,930
platform have and in a way are starting

00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:01,460
to harness to use for these purposes and

00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:03,350
so what we're thinking about the program

00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:05,990
is in a couple of ways I think one more

00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:08,120
narrative building work like this how do

00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,680
we get the story out around the

00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,660
incredible work that's happening on the

00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,370
platform it's not our work it's work

00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:15,110
like the work but that both of your

00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:17,870
organizations and your community are

00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:19,880
doing so how do we amplify that message

00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:21,560
and what role do we have especially as

00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:24,530
sitting at the center of this ecosystem

00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:26,840
to do I think to is really thinking

00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:29,300
about inclusion in open source and I

00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,770
think that you know we know from the

00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,750
research that you know open

00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:34,460
source is not necessarily as diverse as

00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:36,080
you know technology itself is not

00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:38,570
necessarily as diverse as the world

00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,520
around us and as the world is changing

00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:42,380
as we see the fact that future

00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,510
developers are not going to be coming

00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,850
from the same places that they come from

00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:49,070
today that we need to encourage this

00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:51,110
burgeoning and emerging communities in

00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:53,990
Southeast Asia in Africa and Latin

00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:55,970
America there's an important critical

00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:58,280
piece of this that is how do we make

00:34:55,970 --> 00:35:00,800
open source a place that is inclusive

00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,780
that is inviting and that also can

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,060
leverage this incredible talent that we

00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:06,830
see across the world and so starting to

00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,750
think about that is really critical as

00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:10,280
well and now you'd say the third prong

00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:12,160
is really thinking about ways in which

00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,510
we can deepen the capacity of

00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,550
nongovernmental organizations to

00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:19,220
participate it over an open source and

00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:21,710
that's really all kinds of nonprofits or

00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:24,080
non-governmental organizations form the

00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:26,690
mom and pop nonprofit that is you know

00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,730
needs to use an open source volunteer

00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:30,940
database for managing their volunteer

00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:33,230
programs to large philanthropic

00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:35,300
organizations who are starting to pour

00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:37,250
in an incredible amount of resources

00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:40,370
into open source that we can leverage

00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:42,140
and partner to government I think also

00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:44,240
that's another critical piece of this I

00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,920
think with government the open source

00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,380
movement is a little bit further ahead

00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,330
than with nongovernmental organizations

00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:52,430
but they're critical part because of

00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:54,260
we're seeing incredible ways where

00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:56,330
government is using open source to help

00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:59,030
citizens connect with their government

00:35:56,330 --> 00:36:00,830
to get benefits etc and so those are

00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:03,170
sort of three ways in which we hope to

00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:05,420
start to impact open source in this way

00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:06,950
but it's very nascent and I think today

00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:10,280
is very one of the first steps to doing

00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:13,610
that yeah great

00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:15,590
so we have just a few minutes left

00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:17,570
I think before I started this panel they

00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:19,880
said that we couldn't do any audience QA

00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:22,250
but I'm gonna take a chance cuz we do

00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:24,560
have time and we do have handheld mics

00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:27,160
so I wanted to open it up to the

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:33,640
audience if there are any questions

00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:36,660
that you may have of the panelists and

00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,660
I'll run to you

00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:52,120
okay so I have a question I what's your

00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:55,840
opinion on Khan Academy this is the

00:36:52,120 --> 00:37:01,060
learning tool that actually I feels that

00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:04,930
maybe you're familiar with could you

00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:09,690
repeat your question yeah so Khan

00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:09,690
Academy is a I think it's an open source

00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:19,840
people to learn music so you asking

00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:22,390
about Khan Academy yeah well I think

00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:26,020
it's a great platform so very so a new

00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:29,500
platform that foster grimas education

00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:31,450
and by chance at love for Asia some

00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:35,700
wealth we just announced the force Asia

00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:41,680
Academy with Condor offer online courses

00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:44,290
that teach people more on open source so

00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:49,180
when I study in Vietnam and I understand

00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:50,710
that they actually don't teach the the

00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:52,480
idea about open source in school of

00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:53,890
course you learn how to write higher and

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,440
you learn different programming

00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:59,710
languages but there is not a particular

00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,540
course that that teach you how to behave

00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,850
or high in a community or how to

00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:06,790
contribute the community but but I

00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:09,190
totally if you asked about my opinion

00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:11,620
about Khan Academy I used to think a few

00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:13,630
courses there I think that any more and

00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:15,880
more people so that is a platform that

00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:18,430
allow people from everywhere can share

00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:23,710
the knowledge in London remotely it is

00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:27,400
and Ray it is a ray initiative no any

00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:31,590
other questions yes right here in the

00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,590
front and we do have a runner now

00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:40,340
hi-yah what social causes or social

00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:47,330
areas do you guys think that open-source

00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:49,520
is mostly still not as good in I think

00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:51,020
that's that's quite a hard one unless

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,570
you look in specific project I think

00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:55,790
that more gen and the general basis of

00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:58,100
it I just think it's about explaining

00:38:55,790 --> 00:39:00,980
what it actually is what it means what

00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:02,690
it what why why would why would someone

00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:04,520
be interested and I keep thinking about

00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:06,650
somebody told me a story about a fridge

00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,780
and about the fact that you know we buy

00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:10,550
a smart fridge you buy a the physical

00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:12,350
fridge but the software in the fridge is

00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:14,120
not yours but if there's open source it

00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,950
would be yours and there's something

00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,600
about owning something but not owning

00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:18,770
something that actually brings value and

00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,140
this is going to be more and more of a

00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:23,180
debate so I just I threw the French

00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:24,620
thing out to use it was not having a

00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:27,110
conversation with a foster carer

00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:28,370
and she got it by the fridge example and

00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:31,580
I thought well we have to give more and

00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:34,400
more examples about why this issue and

00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:36,670
area is so important to individuals who

00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,050
we would not be touching otherwise I

00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:41,390
totally agree with you I think this is a

00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:43,130
really hard question and people open it

00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:45,860
okay so you do open source what kind of

00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:49,460
social problem or challenge that you

00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:51,680
have to improve what area in the in the

00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:55,610
society that you actually have an impact

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,980
so I think open source is like a tool so

00:39:55,610 --> 00:40:01,160
we're not talking about the specific

00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:03,890
problem but this is the basic ability

00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:06,110
that people have the resources and

00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:07,880
knowledge to fix any problem that I have

00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:09,950
implies it depends on the community and

00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,810
the people decide for themselves what

00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:13,730
kind of social problem they want to fix

00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:16,010
but open source is the idea of

00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:18,230
collaboration and many people feel you

00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:20,780
empower them to see that they can always

00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:24,730
find our solution by working together in

00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:27,950
a more collaborative way I would agree

00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:29,930
so anyway we are out of time and I hope

00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:32,000
they aren't any burning questions but

00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:33,920
you're welcome to you know perch any one

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,110
of us and our panelists before we end

00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,720
but incredible conversation about

00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:41,570
accessibility the importance

00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,430
have been able to build communities in

00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:46,040
ways that really harness the global

00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:47,720
nature of open source and ways in which

00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:50,210
we can really bring social sector

00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:52,670
organizations like NGOs as well as

00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:54,740
government into the fold so thank you

00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:56,690
both for joining us today for this great

00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:58,730
conversation and for your time and

00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:00,450
audience please join me in thanking them

00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:04,510
as well

00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:13,499
