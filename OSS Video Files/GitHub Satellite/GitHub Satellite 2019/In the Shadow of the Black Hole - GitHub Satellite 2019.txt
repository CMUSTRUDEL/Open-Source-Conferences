[Music]

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,060
you

00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,950
hello everybody and welcome to the EHT

00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,890
panel on the event horizon telescope

00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:34,100
results so we have a panel of experts

00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:37,160
here to to help you dive into the shadow

00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,390
of the black hole so first let me

00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,580
introduce you the event horizon

00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,320
telescope collaboration these are a

00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:45,230
hundred twenty over two hundred plus

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,059
member collaboration the EHT is truly

00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,620
global and that its membership is

00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:51,860
comprised of people from Europe Asia

00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,390
Africa North and South America the goal

00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,370
of the event horizon telescope project

00:00:53,390 --> 00:01:01,550
is to image for the first time the

00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:04,369
shadow of a black hole so if you look up

00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:07,310
at the night sky down in the Virgo

00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:10,610
galaxy in the Virgo constellation there

00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,899
is a galaxy called m87 in the M&E seven

00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,610
galaxies there's a supermassive black

00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:17,390
hole that has the second largest

00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:19,759
apparent size as seen from Earth in this

00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,860
galaxy there is a powerful jet of plasma

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,020
that it's believed to come from the

00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,000
supermassive black hole this jet pierces

00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,940
through the entire galaxy can be seen in

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,099
visible light and in radio radio waves

00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,050
are unimpeded by dust with them we can

00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:35,569
we can peer through the entire galaxy

00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:37,160
follow the jet down to its heart as we

00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:39,289
go to higher resolution and higher

00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,209
observing frequency would go to the base

00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:43,099
of the jet where there is the shadow of

00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:44,899
the black hole surrounded by a ring of

00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:49,940
light image for the first time by the

00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:54,140
event horizon telescope so to be able to

00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:55,819
image a black hole we need to have high

00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,459
resolution to make an image of the

00:01:55,819 --> 00:02:00,890
features we're trying to see about 55

00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:03,319
million light years away so in order to

00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,090
get since resolution scales with the

00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:06,950
size of the telescope we need a

00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,869
telescope the size of the earth to be

00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,959
able to see the shadow of the black hole

00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:14,180
in m87 unfortunately nobody would let us

00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:15,760
fund that so we have to get around it by

00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,200
multiple telescopes

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,209
so the EHD of the computational

00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,430
telescope it's not actually a telescope

00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:25,730
the size of the earth we use many small

00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:28,790
telescopes around the globe at different

00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,470
large distances and connect them we use

00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,330
a principle called very long baseline

00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,260
interferometry or VLBI

00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,569
which basically

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,849
helps us connect the telescopes in our

00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:41,180
network and synthesize a telescope

00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:44,459
virtual telescope the size of the earth

00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:46,560
so say we have a distant source far away

00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:49,069
because it's so far away and the radio

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,349
emission it emits arrives as plane waves

00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:54,329
at the telescopes because of the

00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:56,370
geometry of the earth and the distances

00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:58,110
between the telescope's there is a time

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:02,030
difference in their arrival time of the

00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:05,159
signal this time difference is actually

00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:07,349
timed really accurately by atomic clocks

00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,180
or me tzer's these clocks actually lose

00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:12,810
a second every hundred million years so

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,940
they're extremely precise so by timing

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,829
the arrival of the signal we actually

00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,650
timestamp the signal at each telescope

00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:21,599
and record it onto our hard drives we

00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,150
essentially freeze the light that is

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,769
arriving at each telescope record it and

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,889
then combine it later on in

00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:30,450
post-processing

00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:32,849
so the distances between the telescope's

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,829
tell us about the source structure we're

00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:37,230
seeing the closer telescopes are

00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:39,180
together the more signal they can see in

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,699
common so they actually tell us about

00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,859
the large-scale structure of the source

00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:45,690
as you take telescopes further and

00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:47,340
further apart they see less signal in

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:51,379
common and so tell us about the finer

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:54,150
scale structure of the of the source and

00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:56,669
so in order to make an image you need a

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,459
large range of scales and a large range

00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:02,370
of orientations of the telescope's so to

00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,900
do that you need to have many telescopes

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:07,799
at different distances and different

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,829
orientations on the earth so the EHD

00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,079
observes at a frequency of 230 gigahertz

00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:14,459
radio waves that 230 gigahertz

00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:16,820
unfortunately can get scrambled or

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,949
attenuated by water vapor and

00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:22,139
disturbance in the atmosphere the EHD

00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:24,510
gets around that by borrowing telescopes

00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:26,880
that are very high in dry sites at some

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,190
of the most extreme remote locations on

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,699
earth here are some of the telescope's

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:35,699
of our 2017 campaign there's the SMT in

00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:39,270
the mountains of Arizona the JC MT on

00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:40,949
Mauna Kea in Hawaii the LM T in this on

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,820
the volcano sierra negra

00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:46,830
in mexico the elan 30 meters telescope

00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,580
on pico Valletta in the sierra nevada

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,340
and spain

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,650
the UH pecs telescope and the Alma

00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,350
telescope in the Atacama Desert in Chile

00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,780
one of the driest deserts on earth the

00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:02,070
SBT at the geographic South Pole in

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:03,900
Antarctica and the SMA on the Amano Kea

00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,940
in Hawaii as you can see these

00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,160
telescopes were extremely different they

00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,930
look nothing like each other the reason

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,540
for that is that the EHT actually

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,740
borrows them and equips them but the

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,420
telescope's were actually originally

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,560
designed for completely different

00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:21,930
science so although our telescopes have

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,880
different designs and operations they

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,250
have one thing in common or actually two

00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,350
things one thing is the atomic clocks

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,110
that record and timestamp the signal and

00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:33,480
then we have our amazing EHT custom

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,580
recording equipment with this recording

00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:41,550
equipment which you can see on the left

00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:44,250
here this signal is sampled recorded in

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:46,950
these little boxes that are called

00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:50,430
modules each module is stack is a stack

00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:52,530
of standard hard drives in our 2017

00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:56,490
campaign we use 92 of these modules

00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:59,550
across the entire array or 736 standard

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:01,050
hard drives during our observations we

00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,630
have to keep a very close eye on the

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,460
weather so we use our VLBI monitor which

00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:08,820
actually keeps track of the weather and

00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:11,880
forecast at each site in order to make

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:13,470
observations we basically need to keep a

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,360
close eye that all the weather is

00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,430
excellent at all sites to guarantee a

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,060
strong signal recorded at each telescope

00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:23,940
because of the atmosphere in our 2017

00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,410
campaign we had a 10 day window and we

00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,060
had five days where we triggered

00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:32,070
observations with the best weather

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:33,690
possible of course none of this would be

00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:35,790
possible without our instrumentation

00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,950
hardware and software teams and our

00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:39,270
operators and observers that go to these

00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,210
remote sites and carry out our

00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:44,490
observations test our equipment and

00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:46,200
gather these data for us so now I'm

00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,940
gonna pass on to Lindy who will talk to

00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,090
you about how we get this recorded data

00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:57,240
and transform it to perfect data for

00:06:51,090 --> 00:07:00,740
data analysis so I'll be talking about

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,319
the data pathway so this is how we

00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,460
from these signals recorded telescopes

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,229
to the set of data on the right that's

00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:09,349
used for imaging and this is a

00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:10,759
bird's-eye view of the data so we begin

00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:13,190
with all the telescope's pointed at the

00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:14,990
same source recording signals at the

00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,250
same time straight to hard disks you

00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,050
know about a thousand hard disks as

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,400
Sarah mentioned then it turns out the

00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,110
fastest way to get them all the same

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,789
place is physically picking them up and

00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,349
moving them so he shipped them all to

00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:25,669
our correlation Center and the

00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:27,770
correlations that are plays back this

00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:29,330
frozen light it really forms the virtual

00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:32,690
mirror here of our telescope in a very

00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:34,310
fundamental way during another stage of

00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,630
calibration we extract those signals

00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,520
from the data and measure their

00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:39,080
properties and finally after this we're

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,940
ready for forming the image and this is

00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,030
where the image is actually made during

00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,740
image reconstruction one of the stories

00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,930
of the HT is just the massive amount of

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,610
data we processed so you know that the

00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,039
image that you've seen now it's pretty

00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,300
pretty famous it's really a little

00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:55,970
blurry you know maybe characterised by

00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,199
about a hundred pixels or so it fits on

00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,509
a kilobyte you could send it by email

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,919
and we're beginning with petabytes of

00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:02,389
data that were your chords so this is

00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:04,250
about twelve orders of magnitude indeed

00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:05,650
a reduction a huge amount and it really

00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,120
reflects the amount of noise we have to

00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,590
mitigate and the amount of complexity we

00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,680
have to remove for my data before we can

00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:14,419
actually make the image so stepping back

00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,520
a little bit from from the beginning and

00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:17,810
the signals I want to explain the

00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,030
correlation process because it's so

00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,669
fundamental to the way interferometer

00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,440
like the EHT works so what we want to

00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,490
measure between each pair of stations is

00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,039
something called a correlation

00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,659
coefficient and this this describes how

00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:32,029
similar the signals are that are

00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:34,130
recorded to each station in between

00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:36,349
pairs of stations this is a very simple

00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,329
formula you pull it off Wikipedia but

00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,500
when normalized the signals are

00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:41,479
basically zero if they're completely

00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,510
unrelated and one if they're perfectly

00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:46,399
correlated we add all the rest of the

00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,110
sites and align them in time and the

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,310
correlator can form this correlation

00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,709
coefficient between each pair of

00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,240
antennas so they're an interferometer

00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:56,690
becomes very powerful as we add new

00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,829
stations to the array now there are a

00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,570
couple things that make this process

00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,860
hard and this is why this is not so

00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,360
straightforward one is that the

00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,370
correlation coefficients that we expect

00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,329
are actually quite small and the reason

00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,130
is because the signals are noise

00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:09,140
dominated there's a lot of atmospheric

00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,640
background thermal noise that dominates

00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,589
and the correlation coefficient we

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,490
expect this could be one part in a

00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:16,010
million and we need to

00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:18,080
Everage many millions of samples just to

00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,160
be able to get a technical signal the

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,770
other problem is the atmospheres

00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,750
scattering the the timing of our clocks

00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,800
really the timing of our data in ways

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,260
that make it very hard to do this

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,180
averaging so the atmosphere I bring out

00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,529
because it's fundamental to this to

00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,600
observing at these high frequencies in

00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:34,100
the radio and this is just a just a

00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,660
picture of some real data over over a

00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,450
few minutes and the red is atmospheric

00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:40,190
phase and this is really talking about

00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:42,290
how the signals are delayed randomly by

00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,940
turbulence and from the bottom to top of

00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,800
one of these panels is one wrap of phase

00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,839
and a 230 gigahertz that's about 4 Pico

00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,910
seconds so we're really talking about

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,740
very small amounts of timing jitter but

00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:54,470
causing a very significant effect in our

00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,750
data we use our methods to model this

00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:58,010
out and get something nice and stable

00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,959
after which we can collapse all this

00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:01,130
data into one single point so this is

00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:02,600
one example of how the data is

00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:05,930
simplified during the calibration

00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,029
process we developed three independent

00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,920
pipelines to do this this is a theme

00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:11,990
during our data reduction we do things

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,880
in parallel ways so this is three

00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,230
software pipelines in the underlying

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,140
libraries here actually are written in

00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,520
in C C++ in Fortran

00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,740
but all the pipelines are actually in

00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,110
Python and many of the fitting routines

00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:27,589
are actually fundamentally based in in

00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:29,120
in Python but once we put our data

00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:31,000
through all these three calibration

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,550
pipelines we can then use that

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,779
paralyzation and that independent

00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,970
processing of the data to run a bunch of

00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:40,160
cross comparisons so this is what I show

00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,540
here and at this stage of the data

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,829
processing we're just concerned with

00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,260
making sure we're getting the same

00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:48,560
results from all of our independent

00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,029
reduction pipelines another aspect of

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,770
calibration that's very important is is

00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:53,149
folding in the sensitivity of the

00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,100
stations so as I mentioned before the

00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:57,380
Kolar correlation coefficient is a

00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,279
number between 0 & 1 but to translate

00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,140
and there's something physically

00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:01,430
meaningful we fold into sensitivity

00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,610
estimates and because we're using such

00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:06,440
different stations around the earth this

00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:09,140
is important for physically interpreting

00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:12,620
our data this is just one representation

00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:14,360
the data before before processing before

00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,850
folding in sensitivity and what we have

00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,190
here is a degree of similarity between

00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,390
signals recorded to sites versus the

00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:23,360
length of the baseline between the

00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:24,770
stations and after folding in station

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,120
sensitivities we get something that

00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,820
reflects a very simple and elegant

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,040
structure to the data

00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:33,410
and if we overlay what we expect on this

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,480
spectrum of the data from just a simple

00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:38,000
ring model of a source on the sky we see

00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,830
that it's a pretty good match so we have

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,750
this amplitude spectrum we also have the

00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:43,040
phases representing the time difference

00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,450
between signals recorded at different

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,070
stations and this is our fundamental

00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,590
data product that we can then pass to

00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:56,510
imaging and I'll hand it to cause you to

00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:59,060
begin talking about that process so so

00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:03,050
Sarah and Mindy provided an excellent

00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:05,630
introduction of how the EHC works so our

00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,490
HD is assembling eight Tests of in this

00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:10,100
planet that create a planet sized

00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:12,320
telescope with incredibly high on your

00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,540
resolution capable of imaging a black

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,440
hole for the first time so now you can

00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:20,780
see the the RS seen from m87 and you can

00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,240
see that with art notation a new

00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:25,550
telescope is joining the array and you

00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:29,270
can see that a battery our size

00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:31,130
telescope have a universal mirrors with

00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:33,830
the off notations and we got a

00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:35,810
corresponding data set but you can also

00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:38,810
realize that because we have a limited

00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:41,480
number of station in this planet so our

00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:43,930
virtual mirror is really sparsely

00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,610
sampled so that create a situation that

00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:49,520
so there are infinite number of images

00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:52,520
that can actually perfectly explain our

00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,410
data set so at the imaging process each

00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,240
imaging technique or each managing

00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:59,390
algorithm that create image from

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,300
observing data set delay try to derive

00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:04,640
the most likely image from the sparsely

00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:08,150
sampled data set based on its prior

00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,190
knowledge or its prior assumptions so in

00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:12,440
the history of the radio astronomy their

00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:15,260
new two classes of imaging techniques

00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,910
the first one is the most popular and

00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,160
the most traditional technique so called

00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:22,700
the Queen the queen is an inverse

00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:26,630
modeling approach that that try to drive

00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:29,090
a reasonable solution from from the

00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:32,240
image domain in an interactive way by

00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:34,970
the input of users but Creon has a long

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,610
history of more than 40 years and it has

00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:39,260
been tested by data and used by

00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,769
community for a long time

00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,559
that's of

00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:45,019
really good advantage on the other hand

00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:47,269
that interactive nature of the Korean

00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:50,119
actually needs a lot of user input and

00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:53,720
also expertise of some professionals

00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:56,029
knowledges and and also it's also a

00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,339
little bit difficult to incorporate a

00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:00,980
many of serving effect directly in the

00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:03,170
imaging process so that's why if we

00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:05,059
develop another class of new imaging

00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:07,850
techniques that take afford millennia

00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:11,799
loads so that is a Bayesian inspired

00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:14,899
method that can include a lot of prior

00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:16,819
assumptions of or prior notices of the

00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:19,670
images with sometimes combination of

00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:21,739
them we can also incorporate a lot of

00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:24,439
observing effect of suffering instance

00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:27,199
what are the systematic errors remain

00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:29,209
even after the calculations so the new

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,790
imaging technique is more flexible

00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:35,209
imaging process that can match it more

00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:36,920
with the actual observing process so

00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:39,160
such a development of new imaging

00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:42,619
techniques is actually one of the prime

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:44,299
innovation in even HD corporations so

00:14:42,619 --> 00:14:46,069
there are a number of imaging techniques

00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:49,279
that develop in the last several years

00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:51,470
to make the far shaver buccal images and

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,629
most of images most of imaging

00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:56,360
techniques are implemented in two

00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:58,699
independent imaging libraries the first

00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,879
one is a huge team urging library and

00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:04,549
another one is a smiley so both two new

00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:07,929
libraries are a completely open source

00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:11,779
and Python interface and indeed have and

00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:14,149
and as not mentioned in the beginning of

00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:16,579
this conference actually this two new

00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:18,829
imaging libraries are using a lot of

00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:22,339
libraries actually developed by many

00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:24,319
communities so that means you know the

00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:26,990
number of people in many communities

00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:29,029
actually contributed to make these two

00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:31,339
new imaging libraries that actually

00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:34,910
created the first ever images of buccal

00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:36,370
this is a really really cool thing thank

00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:41,300
you

00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:44,480
so um after a number of a special kind

00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:47,630
of data so finally we got a the

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,300
calibrated data set of m87 so what we

00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:54,050
did in the first seven weeks is that we

00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:57,940
split entire image and groove to do the

00:15:54,050 --> 00:16:01,220
four fantastic games say fantastic four

00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:04,160
so it's imaging team have a variety of

00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:06,170
people that have expertise of both

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,360
traditional and new imaging techniques

00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:11,510
and also there are some characters in

00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:14,030
terms of the population of regions and

00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:16,250
also they have also some modest

00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:19,610
technical preference for the for

00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:21,860
instance the first two teams have some

00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,630
preference to use a new imaging

00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,910
techniques on the other hand the latter

00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:28,670
two teams have a modest focus on the

00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:31,930
traditional techniques anyway so each

00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:34,790
four team actually worked on m87 data

00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:37,300
independently without any exchange of

00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:40,730
information with outside of the team and

00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:42,350
seven weeks later we united together at

00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:46,730
the Harvard University at the end of

00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:49,190
July 2018 and and this photo actually is

00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:52,280
showing the exact moment when we

00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:54,830
compared images across four teams for

00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:58,040
the first time and you cannot see is a

00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:59,960
hook unfortunately but you can see

00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,240
actually what are the results from the

00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,730
people's face particularly you know Tate

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,870
is really really small a face you know

00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:11,720
in front of participants so here is the

00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:16,459
first images compared across the four

00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:18,860
teams so these images are made of made

00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:21,230
from the engineering data Lele so that

00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,660
are not coming from the final data data

00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:26,000
have still some issues but but being

00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:28,280
actually got a very consistent basic

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,040
structure so for instance all images

00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:34,250
have a link with a very consistent

00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:36,110
diameter and then also this Ning is not

00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,360
symmetric you know you can you can see

00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:40,430
that the clear asymmetry where the lower

00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:45,710
side of a southern side is wider and

00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:47,720
this basic structure is not is even seen

00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,490
in the you know our final images that

00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,159
person is on April 10th

00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:54,590
so we got it well basically at the basic

00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:56,480
structure at this time with engineering

00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:58,220
in data we have independent four teams

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,130
that actually provide a certain

00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:03,590
confidence about our results so this is

00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:05,929
another memorial photo taken after the

00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:09,110
first comparison of images you can see a

00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:11,899
single m87 image here so this is the

00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:13,700
average of all four teams images this is

00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:16,309
actually really similar to what we

00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,470
presented in a press conference and then

00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:21,020
also you can also see you know fantastic

00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:23,179
international team that actually spent

00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:25,640
several years to develop new imaging

00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:27,320
techniques and also work hard to create

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,260
the first-ever picture of all black

00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,960
holes so this is a tree acrobatic

00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:36,039
relational effort and and obviously we

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:39,279
are proud of our fantastic imaging team

00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:42,289
so the next speaker our view will give

00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:47,840
actually how we lead at the final images

00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:50,870
that person it is on April 10th thanks

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,130
Kazu so yeah once we had done this

00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,169
imaging process with four different

00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,490
blind imaging teams we have a pretty

00:18:54,169 --> 00:18:57,380
good confidence that we weren't sort of

00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:59,360
deluding ourselves into thinking that

00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,830
this image was there in the data and

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,330
that different imaging methods designs

00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:05,539
with different techniques could

00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:06,799
reproduce the same fundamental image but

00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:08,899
then we still have the question of how

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,090
is we best tune the knobs on our virtual

00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:13,580
camera and to get us the best possible

00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:15,980
image or the most reliable image from

00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,360
all these different algorithms I mean so

00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,309
we have three different software

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,260
packages that we used in this next step

00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:22,669
of imaging one based on the traditional

00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,690
clean algorithm cause we described and

00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:25,520
then the two that were developed

00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:27,409
specifically for the HT and really built

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,779
on all of this open-source Python

00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:31,279
software is cause we describe she wanted

00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:33,320
to objectively strive determine what the

00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:38,149
best way to tune all these different

00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:39,470
knobs in the the image would be so the

00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:40,850
way that we did this is we tested tens

00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,220
of thousands of different imaging

00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:45,649
parameter combinations systematically so

00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,240
we did this on a suite of synthetic

00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:48,380
source images and we demanded that our

00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,360
different imaging parameters could

00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,559
really distinguish between these sources

00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,120
and all the different ways that these

00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:55,730
sources might be fooling us into giving

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,000
us similar images we only chose the

00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:02,330
parameters to apply to m87 that were the

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,650
most trustworthy at the end of the day

00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:06,910
while these dip

00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:08,630
imaging methods have different

00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:10,390
resolutions and socially slightly

00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:13,669
different images when we blur them to a

00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:15,710
fundamental equivalent resolution we get

00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:17,299
very similar images I'm really giving us

00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,740
confidence that these images are robust

00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:21,640
so all the different imaging choices

00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:23,900
that we've made and then these images

00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,520
combine together we actually simply

00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,110
average them to give us the final image

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,450
of m87 that we share with the world on

00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:30,500
April 10th so the next part of my

00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:32,000
discussion I talked a little bit on

00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,070
measuring the mass and the size of the

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,809
black hole um so it turns out that

00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:37,730
measuring black hole masks actually very

00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:39,260
difficult on because you're really

00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:41,360
indirectly looking at it so the best way

00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,220
to can do it is with these direct images

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,200
in previous methods have really

00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:48,559
disagreed and are very very difficult to

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,940
do so the massive black hole is

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,049
proportional to the size of its shadow

00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,030
so if we can measure the size of the

00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:54,620
shadow we could really accurately

00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,580
measure the de mass and the exact value

00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,570
depends on the details on the

00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,549
surrounding material and on the

00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:01,429
calibration so we really needed to

00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:02,570
approach this problem systematically and

00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:04,940
the way that we did this it's a common

00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:07,100
theme in the EHT whose three different

00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,179
imaging techniques to measure three

00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,860
different techniques to measure the size

00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:11,660
of the shadow so we could really verify

00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,070
that we're doing this correctly and that

00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,390
our answer made sense the first ones we

00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:16,610
can just measure directly from the image

00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:19,669
we can just take a circle around the

00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:22,070
ring and measure the size this way and

00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:23,540
an uncertainty on that size the next is

00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,580
we can model the data using simple

00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,590
geometric shapes so in this framework we

00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,940
basically decompose the image into a

00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:31,370
simple collection of geometric shapes

00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:34,040
and fit these shapes on to the to the

00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,780
underlying data and we do this using a

00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,510
sort of Bayesian sampling and parameter

00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:40,059
estimation framework so just this one

00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:41,630
which is really samples the stayce of

00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:43,220
uncertainties of the different

00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:46,070
parameters of our image that we're

00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:47,780
sampling in the third ways that we can

00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,130
fit individual frames from supercomputer

00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,809
simulations that Roman will talk about

00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:56,390
next to the underlying image and so this

00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:58,130
week yeah and so all three of these

00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,450
different methods actually use three new

00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:02,150
different software packages that were

00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:05,000
designed the first to design for the EHT

00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:06,470
the first modular MCMC framework called

00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,510
temas that roman will talk about a

00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,280
second gen a which relies on a machine

00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:12,380
learning algorithms genetic algorithms

00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,179
um and then dynasty actually is a

00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,440
software package developed by a grass

00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:18,359
root at Harvard um that we

00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,879
and he's designed for a completely

00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:22,950
different problem and so then we applied

00:22:20,879 --> 00:22:24,599
it to this to this ESG problem and it

00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,799
worked perfectly um and really gave us

00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:27,179
confidence for the other results I think

00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:31,729
that was just a really great example of

00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:33,570
how sort of this collaboration can work

00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:34,979
at the end of the day we found

00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,629
consistent mass measurement using all

00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:38,070
three of our different techniques we

00:22:36,629 --> 00:22:39,599
found actually the m87 is one of the

00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:41,429
most massive black holes known in the

00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:44,399
universe it's 6.5 billion times the mass

00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:46,440
of the Sun I'm actually love this xkcd

00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:48,089
comic that came out the day after our

00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,349
announcement because it really put into

00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:51,330
perspective I think we throw out numbers

00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:53,279
all the time but really this image was

00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,570
the first to give me at least the actual

00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:57,149
perspective of how big this black hole

00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:59,460
is as big as the solar system much

00:22:57,149 --> 00:23:00,719
bigger than the orbit of Pluto yeah and

00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,339
like I said one of the most the biggest

00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:03,659
black holes known so next I'm going to

00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:07,129
turn it to Roman to talk about the

00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:07,129
theoretical interpretation of this image

00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:14,729
all right

00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:16,889
thanks Andrew so um so I think now

00:23:14,729 --> 00:23:19,229
you've gotten a really good idea and a

00:23:16,889 --> 00:23:21,450
good appreciation for how difficult and

00:23:19,229 --> 00:23:23,429
challenging it is to to make these

00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:25,169
measurements to then understand

00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:29,089
calibrate and therefore reduce the data

00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:32,729
and then to reconstruct an image right

00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:34,320
and now I would like to pose to you a

00:23:32,729 --> 00:23:36,119
couple of additional questions that you

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,469
might be interested in so let's take a

00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:40,229
look at this image again and I would

00:23:37,469 --> 00:23:42,809
like to start at square one and ask what

00:23:40,229 --> 00:23:45,269
do you see in this image I think we can

00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:47,609
all agree that there is that there is a

00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:50,190
bright ring of emission we can agree

00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:51,869
that the lower part of the Ring is

00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:54,149
slightly brighter through the upper part

00:23:51,869 --> 00:23:56,849
and there is a dark region inside the

00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:58,799
ring otherwise it wouldn't be a ring but

00:23:56,849 --> 00:24:02,359
now you've discussed features of the

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:05,729
image but now the questions that that

00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:08,809
that theorists are posing themselves is

00:24:05,729 --> 00:24:11,639
how do we know that it's a black hole or

00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:13,589
why does the image look the way it does

00:24:11,639 --> 00:24:15,719
or in other words what's actually going

00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:17,609
on that gives rise to this to this

00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:19,859
emission and of course the theoretical

00:24:17,609 --> 00:24:21,989
implicit implications what does this all

00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:24,479
mean and for all those three questions

00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:27,239
and related questions you need a theory

00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:29,430
so Andrew in the previous talk told you

00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:31,770
already one important ingredient in

00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:33,890
answering question number one how do we

00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:36,210
know it's a black hole a very important

00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:38,010
ingredient is well you first have to

00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:40,290
measure the data but then second you

00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:41,670
need a theoretical prediction Andrew

00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:44,130
told you that the mass of the black hole

00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:45,900
is related to the angular size but

00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:47,820
that's only true because you've assumed

00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,640
a theory that makes this prediction

00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:52,260
without this theoretical prediction you

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,850
you look at this image in a completely

00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,190
different way and it's much harder to

00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:57,720
gain any confidence in the fact that

00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:00,990
you're actually staring at a black hole

00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:03,000
it could be an exploding envelope of a

00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:06,510
star for example or something like that

00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,700
but there is a theory that tells you if

00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:10,110
you have a mass if you if you have a

00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,590
black hole of a certain mass it should

00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:15,000
have this size now um why does the image

00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:17,250
look the way it does I need to dig a

00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,730
little deeper and for that on the on the

00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:23,210
next in the next few slides the theory

00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:26,640
for black holes really was kick-started

00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:28,650
when Albert Einstein in 1915 published

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,770
his revolutionary theory of gravity he

00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:33,600
called general relativity as in 1915 and

00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:38,070
it was in this very sea right in Berlin

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:40,800
and 104 years ago and to his own

00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:42,270
surprise it took only one year until

00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:45,090
Akash Schwarzschild find the first

00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:47,160
solution to his equations and we now

00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:50,550
know that that solution describes the

00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:53,940
gravitational field of a black hole and

00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:55,070
it took until 1963 until Roy Kerr was

00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:58,020
actually able to generalize

00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:02,280
Schwarzschild solution to allow the

00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:03,870
black hole also to have a spin so Albert

00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,790
Einstein's theory was a was a big

00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,650
revolution because unlike in Newtonian

00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:10,760
theory where there is a rigid framework

00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:13,830
of space and time and gravity is just

00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:17,310
forces acting on masses in Einstein's

00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:19,620
theory of gravity you have a construct

00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:21,270
of space-time that gets bend and warped

00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:24,480
by the presence of mass and energy and

00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:27,540
mass and energy moves in response to the

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,480
curvature of that space-time so one of

00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:32,970
the strange and perhaps defining

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,790
properties of black holes is what we

00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:39,090
call the event horizon a surface of no

00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:41,190
return' a surface where if you dip

00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,960
things into it they are lost to the

00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:44,850
exterior world forever

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,460
even light so if light gets too close to

00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:50,250
a black hole it gets absorbed falls into

00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:51,720
the event horizon and never gets out so

00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,510
that's very useful if you're trying to

00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,549
explain a dark region in an image okay

00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:58,529
it's not so great if you have a bright

00:26:56,549 --> 00:27:00,299
ring around so what about that bright

00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:02,520
ring where is that light coming from

00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:03,899
well we need to take a little deeper and

00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,080
we need some simulations that I will

00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:09,270
show you on the next slide so you see in

00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,370
this lower image that these light rays

00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,720
that are getting closer and closer to

00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:15,149
the black hole and the closer they get

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,640
the more they're deflected by the black

00:27:15,149 --> 00:27:19,140
hole until they get too close and then

00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,000
they get absorbed by the black hole and

00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,580
that's what's giving rise to what we

00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,799
call a shadow the lens structure of the

00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:30,120
event horizon that we see it infinity in

00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:31,679
our telescopes all right so so what what

00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,539
what happens around this black hole

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,820
what's actually physically going on that

00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:38,220
gives rise to this emission well let me

00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:42,510
take you a second time on a journey to

00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:43,919
m87 we're going to zoom in and we're

00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:45,990
going to go through the same scales that

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,059
you saw before now we're approaching

00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:48,809
scales we can see with a Hubble

00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:51,059
telescope

00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:53,010
this fantastically bright jet region

00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:54,960
that points you to the center of the

00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:57,690
galaxy and now you don't see an image

00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:01,110
but you see a simulation that shows you

00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:02,669
what happens to the gas as it orbits the

00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:04,440
black hole and as it falls onto the

00:28:02,669 --> 00:28:07,620
black hole it turns out it's a very

00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:10,500
turbulent very wild environment the gas

00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:12,450
heats up to billions of degrees and you

00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,580
see how the matter is ejected in these

00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:17,880
in these Jets at these very powerful

00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:20,090
Jets and then you turn this into an

00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:23,760
image and I'll get to that in a second

00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:24,840
you see in the left panel one of the one

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,750
of the images that we were able to

00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,429
extract you see in the middle an image a

00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:31,380
theoretical image that was generated

00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:34,110
from one of the simulations you just saw

00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:36,090
and you see on the right a blurred

00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:38,549
version of that theoretical image and

00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:40,740
the amazing thing is that the observed

00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:43,260
image and the blurred version of the

00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,460
theory image look very similar and that

00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,409
gives us a great degree of confidence

00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:49,590
that we have some idea of what's going

00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:51,600
on okay and the ring is caused by the by

00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:53,279
the light that is lin's into your line

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,200
of sight because the black hole is

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:58,090
focusing it into your telescope

00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,250
and the bright part in the self is

00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:02,590
brighter because it's material that

00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:04,990
comes at you at almost the speed of

00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:07,480
light and things are much brighter when

00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:09,490
they approach you so you have to turn

00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,990
the crank in comparing theory and data

00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:14,080
and you have to do this many many times

00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:16,690
and here you see a whole library of

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,490
these simulations that I showed you and

00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:20,889
each one of those takes a week or two to

00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,990
run on thousands of computational cores

00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:25,029
and you have to turn these into images

00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:27,429
many images that depend on viewing angle

00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:29,529
and spin on magnetic flux and all kinds

00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:32,590
of things and you need to very and

00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:35,080
constantly compare data and theory to

00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:38,580
figure out what's going on which models

00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:41,230
can explain the data which ones cannot

00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,970
and Andrew mentioned this already

00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:45,070
there are many software packages that we

00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:47,529
use for this one of them is temas you

00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:50,320
can find temas on github it's hosted

00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:52,570
there there's a lot more collaborators

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,639
there that have worked with MS and other

00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:56,649
software packages and we find nice

00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:58,510
agreement among those key to this

00:29:56,649 --> 00:30:00,610
progress and it highlights the

00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:02,470
collaborative nature of our work which

00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,899
is also built built into these software

00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:07,320
packages and we need extensible and

00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:10,440
modular codes that we can easily develop

00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:14,559
with it with a long-term perspective

00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:16,960
okay so um here's here's a view of demos

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:19,450
on github obviously it's very useful for

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,279
us to track changes in the code monitor

00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:24,700
progress and even helps with validation

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:26,320
of the code and so on so about the

00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,970
theoretical implications just to

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,860
summarize real quick so the first ever

00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:32,710
black hole image and in particular the

00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:34,809
agreement of theory and data is actually

00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:37,779
a game-changer for understanding of

00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:39,909
gravity and Jets and so far Einstein's

00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:41,740
theory seems to be supported by the data

00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:44,889
and also the black hole nature of the

00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:46,840
source is supported in fact we tried

00:30:44,889 --> 00:30:48,460
some black hole mimickers that are not

00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,409
quite black holes but behave in a

00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:52,750
similar way and they're disfavored by

00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:54,610
the data and the question is can we look

00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,649
for deviations from Einstein's theory

00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:58,269
and this is something that the next

00:30:56,649 --> 00:31:00,429
speaker CK is going to tell you more

00:30:58,269 --> 00:31:02,260
about and also about some of the other

00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:05,279
codes and software that were used in the

00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,279
process thank you

00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:16,800
so thank you woman hello okay so in this

00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:20,010
last few minutes I want to go back to a

00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,960
few very simple points the first one

00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:25,680
years the event horizon telescope is a

00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:28,230
scientific experiment so you're taking

00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:32,340
the image of the black hole is just the

00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:37,140
first step in an era of new gravity

00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:39,720
experiments so the big question here is

00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:42,090
how gravity works and if Einstein is

00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,310
correct a lot and it turns out you're

00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:46,650
given all the confirmation that Roman

00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:48,900
just told us there is a signature in

00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:51,690
this black hole image that can answer

00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:53,850
these big questions so you know I want

00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:57,680
to show you a software that we developed

00:31:53,850 --> 00:32:00,690
a few years ago that we follow the

00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:05,340
geodesics of photon or on curved

00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:07,860
space-time so the idea there if you know

00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:13,140
if we send a quarter million photons to

00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:16,500
a black hole we will see your the

00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:19,500
algorithm will integrate here according

00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:21,450
to Einstein's equations and some of them

00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,550
will hit the UN horizon and got stuck

00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:25,320
there some of them you passed around the

00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:27,180
black hole you walk around a black hole

00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:30,000
a few times and some of them will just

00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:32,640
fight through and you know just to give

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,760
you a perspective in order to create an

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:38,550
image in the interstellar movie it takes

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:41,040
a hunger CPU hours to render a single

00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:43,860
frame but with this software that we

00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:46,290
develop fans for the GPU technology we

00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:48,930
are able to compute a single image in

00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:51,990
three seconds and using this kind of

00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:56,730
calculation and follow how like orbit

00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:57,990
around black hole we realized that if I

00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:00,090
stein is correct

00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:02,760
it turns out that the shape of the black

00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:04,590
hole shadow is independent of the black

00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:07,020
hole's being and the inclination angle

00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:09,410
that we look at it and it's always a

00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:12,420
circle so this is a very unique

00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:15,480
signature that we can use and there are

00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:18,050
other kind of your gravity theories out

00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,970
there and they actually predict where

00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:23,180
different shape of the black hole shadow

00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:25,790
so your email collaboration many of us

00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:27,860
actually want to disprove Einstein but

00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:30,290
the fact that you know the black hole

00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:32,870
shadow is consistent with the ship with

00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:38,090
a circle is indicating that Einstein's

00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:40,340
right again but it's always right but

00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:43,460
you're in the future in the future when

00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:46,280
we add more telescopes to our way you

00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:47,870
maybe even go to space we will blue we

00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,450
will be able to place your tighter

00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:53,060
constraint on general relativity and

00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:54,890
understand gravity better and maybe at

00:33:53,060 --> 00:34:00,590
some point we will you'll be able to

00:33:54,890 --> 00:34:02,000
tell which part is wrong okay so the

00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:04,880
second point I want to bring up to you

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,090
if your modern science is advanced in

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,890
the level that you require large

00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:12,140
collaboration the science and all the

00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:15,470
technology involved is so complicated

00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:18,380
that there's no single team can a single

00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:20,179
person can handle that so your energy is

00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,200
key we have scientists with very

00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:23,240
different background

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,550
all working on different part of the

00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:28,100
experiment and the collaboration bring

00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:30,560
off us together to achieve a single goal

00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:34,220
and this is very similar to git and

00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:36,500
github the distribution of get allowed

00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:38,360
developers like you to work

00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:42,140
independently but at the same time

00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:45,140
collaborate on your projects and this is

00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:46,760
again a list of your important open

00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:49,730
source software that we use in our

00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,440
collaboration so thanks again and at the

00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:53,530
end of the day yoky helped bring

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,419
everything together to form a community

00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:58,550
and in that sense the yeast here in

00:34:56,419 --> 00:35:01,130
scientist in you we are just part of the

00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:04,550
community and we are trying our best to

00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:07,370
contribute back and pick our software

00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:10,130
open-source so this is smiley that

00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:12,950
castle showed you earlier Carthoris

00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:15,050
could be in this software and this is HD

00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:17,840
imaging and who is meeting there and

00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:20,660
Lindy and myself and other people in the

00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:23,150
East here contributing the one beautiful

00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:25,160
thing of putting this on github is we

00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:28,190
receive contribution from people that

00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:30,740
will ever met they may not be astronomer

00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:31,820
but they are expert in Python the expert

00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,770
in dr.

00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:37,550
and their contribution helped us improve

00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:39,650
the software and at the same time our

00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:43,640
team also used keep to version control

00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:46,400
our data the result is our data analysis

00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:48,380
of reproducible reproducibility is the

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,320
hallmark of science methods so this is

00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:54,230
very important and it's my pleasure to

00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:57,650
tell you that our team actually released

00:35:54,230 --> 00:36:00,440
both all three of our image

00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:04,070
reconstruction pipeline and also a

00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:14,030
calibrated data set on github so all of

00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:17,600
you can go there run your software and

00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:19,580
create your own m87 image and actually

00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,920
they're already teachers out there use

00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:24,650
it software and data and put them into

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,420
astronomy classes and we are here just

00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:29,200
where we excite you to see how this can

00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:32,350
inspire a new generation of scientists

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:35,000
so the last thing I want to say is your

00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:37,880
science and technology are converging

00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,010
the next big discovery is going to

00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:42,680
happen at the intersection of science

00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:46,160
and technology and as open-source

00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:49,010
software developer of you a contribution

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,110
of you're contributing to this and all

00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:54,520
of you a part of this so thank you very

00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:54,520
much for all your hard work

00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:43,120
all right so do we have a couple of

00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,830
minutes for questions

00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,360
is there any so there's a microphone

00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:50,550
there if you have any questions for the

00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:52,510
panel we can take one or two anything

00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:56,200
anything you want to know about the

00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:57,730
project or the software um yeah can you

00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,560
please just go to the mic there's a

00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:03,160
microphone right there and then we can

00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:04,960
hear you hi thank you very much

00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,720
I was wondering if there was any

00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,790
satellite in the solar system that could

00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:15,670
be added to the telescope array to make

00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:19,200
it bigger satellite in the solar system

00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:21,430
like a planet or a moon or to go solar

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,300
solar system scale instead of planet

00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:30,820
scale Oh so I mean maybe you can take

00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:33,820
take this on the space space stuff okay

00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:36,460
so so well actually the argue resolution

00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:38,980
of the EHC is limited by this the size

00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:41,860
of this planet so of course if you go if

00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:44,470
we launch a satellite in his face and

00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:46,120
then we can increase on we can actually

00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:49,060
go to higher higher angular resolution

00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:50,950
so so for instance if we launch a

00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:53,680
satellite on the mid Earth's orbit where

00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:55,510
the GPS satellites are then actually we

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,880
can increase angular resolution by

00:38:55,510 --> 00:39:01,540
factor 3 or 4 that actually provide

00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:04,030
maybe another four eyes and scale images

00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:07,270
of other supermassive local in other

00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:10,720
galaxies or we can also get much finer

00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:13,090
images for the m87 yeah so that's

00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:16,510
actually one of our scope in the next

00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:21,130
decade thank you for the talk was very

00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:24,490
interesting the rotation of the earth is

00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:27,280
that more like giving you accuracy or is

00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:30,040
it taking it away if that currency so is

00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:34,840
it helping for your resolution or is it

00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:36,310
worse basically so actually so we take

00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:39,790
into account the rotation of the earth

00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:41,530
when we do our calibrations or when we

00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:43,480
combine the data together we actually

00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:44,020
take into account how the earth moves

00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,940
and

00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:49,030
the telescope's move apparent to each

00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:50,950
other but the Earth's rotation synthesis

00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:52,420
which we use in imaging actually help us

00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:54,460
fill our coverage

00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:56,860
so we basically use the earth as our

00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:59,440
telescope to basically rotate beneath

00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:01,480
our feet and kind of with it we sweep

00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,460
different parts of the source so we

00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,230
basically use the earth to kind of sweep

00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:07,240
around different regions and different

00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:08,830
dimensions and orientations of the

00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:12,060
source and get more information about

00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:18,820
what we're observing thank you thank you

00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:21,730
one more yes why m87 of all of the black

00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:25,150
holes that's a great question

00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:27,100
who wants to take this one Roman okay

00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:34,510
I'll give you a couple of reasons it's

00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:37,360
um it's big we can see through it that's

00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:39,040
not always the case so it happens to

00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:41,890
shine bright enough that we can see it

00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,690
and the stuff around is not opaque so

00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:45,880
you can really pinch through it and you

00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:48,060
can get this nice ring and we've looked

00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,710
at other sources as you may have heard

00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:52,180
but this one was the one that that

00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:54,460
looked promising right from the start as

00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:57,070
you could see the moments and the slides

00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:58,359
it just looked very promising and so we

00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:01,060
focused all of our attention and it's

00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:03,670
been a lot of work but there's more to

00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:05,710
come for sure yes we observed another

00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:07,690
black hole Sagittarius a star which is

00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:09,369
at the center of our own galaxy it's the

00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:12,130
supermassive black hole in our Milky Way

00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:14,740
but that one is a lot smaller so it's a

00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:17,710
lot more variables m87 is like taking a

00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:19,570
picture of a person it's a long exposure

00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:21,940
of a person ready to take a portrait

00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:24,369
sign a star is basically taking a

00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:26,770
picture of a running toddler in long

00:41:24,369 --> 00:41:28,630
exposure so that's the kind of challenge

00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:30,369
we're dealing with next is learning how

00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:33,310
to make movies and we're going to need a

00:41:30,369 --> 00:41:35,020
lot more a lot more input and software

00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:36,910
help from the community to be able to

00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:40,540
tackle that challenge so we're looking

00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:43,759
forward to that I think we're we're out

00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:45,819
of time so thanks a lot for coming

00:41:43,759 --> 00:41:45,819
you

00:41:54,120 --> 00:42:03,130
