Publication date: 2021-03-28
Playlist: GitHub Satellite India 2021 - DevOps: Day 1
Description: 
	Presented by Uma Mukkara, Maintainer @ LitmusChaos / CEO @ ChaosNative

Since Kubernetes has achieved mainstream adoption, achieving safe upgrades and resilience in production has become a challenge when the delivery of changes are happening at a much faster pace than before. Fortunately, new Chaos Engineering tools have emerged to meet the needs of resilience engineering of Kubernetes. In this session, Uma will talk about the importance of building application resilience testing into CI pipeline stages using GitHub Actions. Uma will do a couple of LitmusChaos experiments and demonstrate the functioning and usage of the Actions. Then, he'll touch upon best practices for running GitHub Actions on Azure and on native Kubernetes. There will also be a 5- to 10-minute Q&A after the demo.
