Description: 
	Presented by Tarun Pothulapati, Software Engineer @ Buoyant

Automated testing, building, and deployment are critical to the health of your project. For open source projects, which often have contributors across the globe, having automation in place can be the difference between success and failure. In this talk, Tarun Pothulapati will explore how Linkerd, a CNCF Service Mesh, has implemented CI/CD. He'll also share Linkerd’s journey to adopting GitHub Actions. Finally, he'll share how the project went from taking 30 minutes to run tests all the way to under 10 minutes. Attendees can expect a live demonstration of Linkerd’s current workflow. Make sure you pay attention if your project uses Kubernetes!
