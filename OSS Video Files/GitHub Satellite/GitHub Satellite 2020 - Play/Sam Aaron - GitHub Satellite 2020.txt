Description: 
	An improvised DJ session live coded with Sonic Pi, by the creator and maintainer, Sam Aaron.

Sam sees code as a creative form of expression for everyone not just professional programmers. Sam created Sonic Pi, a live coding music environment, in order to lower the barriers to entry for a creative experience with code for everyone.

Sam has live coded internationally featuring in the Royal Albert Hall, Berlin Warehouses, Music Festivals, on the BBC and even school assemblies. The Rolling Stone magazine described his Moogfest performance as “transcending the present”.
