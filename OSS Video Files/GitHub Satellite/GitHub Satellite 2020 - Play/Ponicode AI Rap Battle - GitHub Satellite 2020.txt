hi everyone

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,279
welcome to the pony code ai rap battle

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,119
at github satellite

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,720
you've maybe seen rap battles in real

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,160
life but here today

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,320

world we're here for an

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,800
ai powered rap battle that pits the pony

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,679
bot an ai wrapping machine created by

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,920
pony code

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,559
against a real human rapper larry

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,960
charles coming to us from the bay area

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,360
my name is elisa chen and i'm the ceo of

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,480
pony code the proud sponsor of today's

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,079
rap battle

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,520
please allow me to introduce you to our

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,399
rappers

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,640
ponybot is an ai-powered rap lyrics

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,960
generator created by pony code

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,480
in our day job pony code is your ai

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,719
partner for coding

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,520
allowing you to create modify and

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,920
visualize

00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,399
unit tests in just a few clicks on our

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,079
simple ai powered interface

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,320
so maybe you're hearing the short

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,280
description and you're asking yourself

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,400
what does pony code have to do with wrap

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,320
to be honest

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,760
not much except that our team is made up

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,040
of people who love hanging out and

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,520
listening to rap music

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,040
and love data science and coding so this

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,960
is what naturally comes out of our

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,720
coffee breaks

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,040
let me also introduce you to larry

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,799
charles larry is a connecticut-born

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,720
video game developer with a knack for

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,600
clever wordplay and all things

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,119
creative larry has graciously accepted

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,840
our challenge to go up against the

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,040
machine

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,439
but more on that later so here's the

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,200
download for this session today

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,119
first we're going to start with edmull

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,320
one of pony code's founders and a super

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,320
data scientist

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,159
who will tell us all a little bit more

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,399
about how he created the pony bot

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,920
the pony code wrap generator and what it

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,920
does

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,200
next we will train the pony bot to

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,799
generate rap lyrics

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,880
based on the hundreds of suggestions

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,640
that you've sent in thanks

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,079
and you'll get to peek at the code as it

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,719
learns

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,159
then we'll move on to the rap battle i'm

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,640
obviously biased so i'm going to hand

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,319
over the rap battle to a neutral referee

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,160
we're going to have three rounds in the

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,800
battle with a pony bot going first in

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,239
each round

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,160
followed by larry who will follow with

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,000
his own brilliant lines

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,599
during this rap battle you'll have the

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,080
opportunity to vote live

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,040
for the ponybo abot or for larry as they

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,879
wrap away

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,239
and will crown an ultimate winner at the

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,000
end of this event

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,360
you can vote by going to the twitter

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,520
page for pony code

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,560
our handle is at pony code dev but

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,239
you'll see that on the bottom of your

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,239
screen a little bit later

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,720
and and then voting on the poll that

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,400
we'll have running there

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,560
for those of you watching from home

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,080
which i think is most people today

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,599
we wanted to be honest with you and let

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,239
you know that we've pre-recorded part of

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,599
this event

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,280
since we're all in different places

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,599
across lots of time zones

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,640
but i reassure you that the voting and

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,840
crowning of the winner

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,400
will be done live so now i'll hand it

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,879
over to

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,159
edmund super data scientist and pony

00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,840
code co-founder

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,760
to tell us a little bit more about the

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,200
pony code rack generator machine

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,360
and how he created it edmund

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,480
thank you elisa and hi everyone my name

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,159
is ed mohawt

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,000
i'm a data scientist and one of the

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,760
co-founders of ponycod

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,239
i grew up in france in a family of

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,440
engineers my mother is an engineer my

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,720
father is an engineer

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,360
my aunts my cousins my brother my uncles

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,159
all engineers everything about number in

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,920
my family

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,080
even my cats become very strong in

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,080
arithmetic when it comes

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,680
to counting the keyboards in his plate

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,159
no need to tell you how hard it was for

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,319
me

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,840
to write my essays in school to fire all

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,720
my neurons just to write a bunch of

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,920
sentences

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,760
that resulted in barely passing grades

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,120
some kids in my class wanted to be

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,200
astronauts other wanted to be president

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,319
all i ever wanted was some kind of

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,799
robots to write my essays for me

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,879
so six months ago my girlfriend told me

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,360
i never wrote her a poem

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,400
obviously it was one day before her

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,480
birthday

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,519
so i grabbed a pen a piece of paper

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,080
and put on some french rap music to put

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,439
myself

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,159
in a romantic mood that was the moment i

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,720
realized

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,480
i was even worse at writing lines than

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,680
was than when i was a kid

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,280
and why a poem poems are not fun my past

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,919
was coming back to haunt me

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,800
why couldn't she just ask for some rap

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,520
lyrics

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,160
and that's when it struck me everything

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,520
in my life

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,440
had led me to this moment my love for up

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,960
my job as a data scientist and my

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,680
hateful writing

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,199
i was destined to solve it right here

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,000
and right now

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,040
so three hours and three gigs of data

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,160
later

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,120
i got my first ai rapper generating

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,280
thousands of lyrics needless to say i

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,199
never could finish that poem

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,120
to be honest i didn't even finish their

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,680
first sentence

00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:00,720
so i showed my girlfriend the rap lyrics

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,160
and then she was my ex but in a

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,880
very weird and selfish way i felt very

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,680
happy

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,800
because i had fulfilled my destiny and

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,400
today is the day

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,400
i share my masterpiece with you

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,680
okay let's go for the tutorial so i've

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,240
prepared the google collaboratory

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,800
notebook

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,440
accessible by anyone with the codes and

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,840
tools

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,360
for this generator in case you want to

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,880
try it at home

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,960
for those who aren't familiar with

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,720
google collaboratory it's basically a

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,800
shareable online notebook

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,160
where you can execute your codes sell by

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,320
sale in python

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,280
it's basically the google doc of python

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,120
code

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,960
for the ai wrapper to run you first need

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,680
to prepare your environment

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,400
i have made the bots called open source

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,800
on github

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,639
all of you can clone it also we will

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,039
need to install the marquis

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,320
package that will be used in the first

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,520
step of the ai

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,080
pipeline cd to the

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,720
rub battle folder run the cell to

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,000
download the nltk packages

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,080
and don't worry if you don't know these

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,720
packages you don't need to know how they

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,720
work

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,720
to understand how the ai was built

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,840
so before we train our models we have to

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,240
prepare the data

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,520
let's create two folders one folder for

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,560
the artistic mode

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,600
in the artistic slash data folder and

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,160
the other for

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,880
the freestyle mode in the freestyle

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,560
slash

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:30,560
data folder click on refresh

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:34,720
to see the new folders click on battle

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,840
and then on artistic click right on data

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,319
uploads and select all your lyrics

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,479
the upload is quite fast the data does

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,800
not stay more than a few hours

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,680
or a day on collaboratory so you may

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,960
have to repeat

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,039
this process

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,080
let's do the same for freestyle click on

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,360
freestyle

00:06:52,080 --> 00:07:03,840
then click right on data and upload your

00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:03,840
your lyrics

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,039
okay we are good to go so let's create a

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,280
pony codewrapper instance

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,120
and now the training on artistic modes

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,800
can start

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,639
as you can see i am loading the data

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,120
from the artistic slash

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,680
data folder to make it faster for this

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,400
video

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,800
i've only put 100 sentences and state

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,240
size

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,800
of two as parameter so if you try this

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,160
at home i would advise putting at least

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,039
five thousand sentences

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,759
and a state size of three to get really

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,160
quality

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,280
lyrics don't forget to pass the

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,400
parameter

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,879
modes as artistic

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,759
the training then takes about five to

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,560
ten minutes

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,919
for a thousand songs so let me explain

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,039
how the artistic model

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,800
actually works first it uses the

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,160
markovify package

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,720
to build a markov chain markov chains

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,440
allow calculating probabilities for

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,440
sequences

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:14,160
of words the way it works is very simple

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,120
so we give the model a list of sentences

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,360
and it learns

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,560
which word is more likely to be followed

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,639
by the other

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,319
for example if i give the model the

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,440
sequence of words

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:28,000
i and like

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,560
then it will predict a next word for

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,919
example

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,719
rap so i gave i and like as input

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,440
and it predicted rap the sentence

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,120
generated

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:42,399
is i like rap if i give as input

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,120
what is your it will suggest name

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,080
what is your name so many companies use

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,880
markov models

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,080
for completion of sentences the higher

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,839
the state size

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,880
the better your model will keep words in

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,200
memory if the state size

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,240
is equal to two the model will take into

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,720
consideration

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,920
the last two words to generate a third

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,839
one

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,279
if the state size is equal to three it

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,600
will consider the last

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,360
three words to generate the fourth one

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,920
however i don't advise you putting a

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,240
state size greater than three to avoid

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,920
overfitting

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,920
because of course the higher the state

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,120
size is the higher the meaning of the

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,839
sentence

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,680
that will be generated but the higher

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,080
your probabilities of repeating

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,959
a whole sentence already written in your

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,160
data

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,959
and in the end just making an algorithm

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,000
that repeats

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:40,240
your data sets without any kind

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,640
of intelligence so once the

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,560
markov chains are set up ponycode

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,959
generates the number of sentences you

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,600
gave

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,880
as a parameter here the sentence number

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,200
is 100

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,640
and i would advise you to make at least

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,880
five thousand to increase

00:09:52,640 --> 00:10:00,480
the variety of your lyrics then

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,079
what ponycard does is uh it creates

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:08,320
order out of the chaos of the 5 000

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:11,600
generated sentences it creates an order

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,720
where sentences are paired are grouped

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:18,000
by rhyme obviously

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,800
any algorithm that creates order

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,600
from chaos is very costly and if there

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,720
are some

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,839
heroes heroes among you who wants to

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,640
contribute to make

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,360
this training faster then then it is the

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,360
first place to look

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,480
so when you will when you generate

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,360
lyrics

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,279
pony codes will pick pairs groups of

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,920
sentences that's rhyme

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,519
and make a paragraph follow it following

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,959
a wrap pattern

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:50,959
so a a b b a b

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:54,880
a b or a b b a and each paragraph

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,880
we follow one of these patterns

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,720
okay now that all the training is done

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,120
it's time for some fun

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,920
we can generate our first lyrics here in

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,079
the parameters

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,519
i have put inverses equal to four to

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,839
make the ponybots generate

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,959
four paragraphs i will not read them for

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,040
you for this time

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,079
since you will see plenty of them in the

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,480
battle but

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,560
let's make a quick analysis so we can

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,680
see an aabb pattern

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:23,120
with the rhyme in e so b and me

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:26,079
and one with a rhyme in apps

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,079
so caps and wraps and all the other

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,880
paragraphs are following the expected

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,640
pattern

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,399
thank you all for your attention i

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,120
really enjoyed sharing the ponybots with

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,880
you

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,959
don't forget that the repo is open

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,079
source so you are free to use it

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,040
and contribute thanks so much for that

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,760
elisa we are

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,240
so excited to have you and all the pony

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,880
code

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,240
team here and we've got this amazing

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,440
pony bot here

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,639
which is based on a whole bunch of crowd

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,160
suggested songs

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,320
that heaps of different people from the

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,560
community have been putting in

00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,920
throughout online forms it is like a

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,519
secret source of

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,040
everything that's been happening it's

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,760
creating all the fun

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,760
that you're gonna see right here today

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,959
now to give you a little bit of idea

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:14,160
about how this ponybot has been trained

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,200
we've got some fantastic lineup of all

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,760
different types

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,320
of song genres we've got old school

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,880
songs

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,880
we've got some french and even german

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,560
rap i'm very excited to see that let's

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,399
just say that and then we've got

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,880
anything from hamilton music and

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,959
so so many other different genres so you

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,120
can see we've really trained this spot

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,320
on a whole range of different music and

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,959
different songs

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,399
so it can give our human competitor a

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,959
really good run

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,760
for his money now speaking of our human

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,560
competitor

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,560
we have larry here who's going to battle

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,920
this amazing ai bot so

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,000
larry welcome tell us all about yourself

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,920
oh hey everybody i'm larry charles i'm a

video game designer by trade but i love

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,440
creating rap music writing raps and just

00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,880
battling whenever i get a chance so

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,000
thanks for picking me to do this i'm

right down to business now the first

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,480
theme of the first one we've got coming

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,560
up is

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,800
man versus machine so as they wrap

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,160
as they battle we've got some polls

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,040
happening over on twitter

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,079
so we want you all yeah you to go on

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,639
over to twitter

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,480
and vote for your favorite rap battle

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,200
artist is it going to be the man

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,000
or will it be the machine human versus

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,279
robot

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,120
who is going to win i'm so excited let's

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,279
get into it

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,440
now ponybot is going to take us away

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,959
they're first up onto the stage so

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,959
take it away ponybutt

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,240
we're going to be around so take what

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,680
you found

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,680
i'm the future with a bunch of weight

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,199
every time i log in

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,199
when the walls fall around you is when

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,800
you will know when to begin

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,800
i have never seen you but i know you're

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,880
not the only one missing

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,480
but i want to be loved by digital

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,839
witnesses what's the point of doing

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,040
anything

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,120
in 77 and 69 revolution was in the air

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,800

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,600
name people lining up just to give the

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,839
blame

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,120
world where they've given me

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,480
i once had friends but i can't feel it

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,639
inside

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,920
there's no place to hide i hit you with

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,639
a hard hand you know

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,399

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,800
with all you proceed

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:48,079
i stare at my phone and the voice said

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,079
this is the inspiration i need

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,440
we were meant to be if you need a

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,959
boyfriend please don't mention me

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,600
because even though this is man vs

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,959
