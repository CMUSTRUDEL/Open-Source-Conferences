Description: 
	Presented by Gene Kogan

Over the past several years, two trends in machine learning have 
converged to pique the curiosity of artists working with code: the 
growing popularity of powerful open source deep learning frameworks like
 Torch and TensorFlow, and the emergence of data-intensive generative 
models for hallucinating images, sounds, and text as though they came 
from the oeuvre of Shakespeare, Picasso, or just a gigantic database of 
digitized cats. This talk will review these developments, present 
various artworks, and offer a set of interdisciplinary tools and 
learning resources for artists and data scientists alike, if ever there 
was a difference to begin with.

Gene Kogan is an artist and a programmer who is interested in autonomous systems, collective intelligence, generative art, and computer science. He is a collaborator within numerous open-source software projects, and gives workshops and lectures on topics at the intersection of code and art. Gene initiated ml4a, a free book about machine learning for creative practice, and regularly publishes video lectures, writings, and tutorials to facilitate a greater public understanding of the subject. 

GitHub Satellite: A community connected by code

On May 6th, we threw a free virtual event featuring developers working together on the worldâ€™s software, announcements from the GitHub team, and inspiring performances by artists who code.
