Description: 
	Coding Augmented Reality Live (CARL) is an open-source livecoding 
environment created by Chirag Davé and Char Stiles. In this session, 
Char will use CARL to code a 3D shader from scratch, which you can use 
your phone to see in augmented reality. Char will comment her code and 
use descriptive variable names so you can get a sense of what each line 
is doing. This performance is set to a soundtrack by Dan Gorelick. You 
can read more about CARL (and see a video which explains it better)

Char Stiles is a multidisciplinary digital artist. She works using emerging technologies as tools for expression. Using computational systems and algorithms she is producing pieces that spans disciplines such as video, dance, interactive installation, performance and online works.

GitHub Satellite: A community connected by code
