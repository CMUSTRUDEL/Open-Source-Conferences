Description: 
	Presented by Cassie Tarakajian

Have you written code before, but never thought about how it could be used for art? What are the artistic possibilities for software? This session will introduce the foundational concepts of creative coding through p5.js, a JavaScript library with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else. This session will explore how software techniques, such as algorithms, randomness, data, and interactivity can be applied to creative work. Familiarity with JavaScript or code syntax is recommended.

Cassie Tarakajian (they/them) is a technologist and artist based in Brooklyn, New York. Their work focuses on creative tools, working as an engineer at Cycling ’74 and as the lead developer and maintainer on the open source p5.js Web Editor. They also teach creative coding workshops and classes, and serve as an adjunct professor at NYU ITP. Past artistic projects range from generating sonnets from Wikipedia contributions to teaching computers how to love as a member of the band Lullabies for AI.

GitHub Satellite: A community connected by code

On May 6th, we threw a free virtual event featuring developers working together on the world’s software, announcements from the GitHub team, and inspiring performances by artists who code.

ah

00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:11,609
[Music]

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:23,140
hi my name is Cassie and today I'm gonna

00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,900
be talking about the basics of creative

00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:28,630
coding by doing a little live coding and

00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:31,150
p5.js so if you've just seen some of the

00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:33,580
past talks and you're feeling really

00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,050
inspired or kind of like intimidated

00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,580
like well I don't even know how I could

00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,680
possibly ever do this and I think this

00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,699
talk is for you but first I want to

00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,989
introduce myself

00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:46,150
hi I'm Cassie I am a technologist and

00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:49,960
artist and educator so that means that I

00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:53,020
do a few different things one thing I do

00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,059
is I work on the software for creative

00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,739
tools so this is a picture of a

00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:59,379
graphical programming language called

00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:01,030
max/msp it's a good musical programming

00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:02,739
language it's managed by a company named

00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:06,430
cycling 74 that I've worked with for a

00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:08,950
few years I also teach here is a picture

00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,380
of me teaching a max workshop this past

00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:15,220
summer down to some high school students

00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:17,440
and I also teach at a grad program at

00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,479
NYU called ATP or interactive

00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,160
telecommunications program and talked

00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:23,920
creative coding there for about two

00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:26,590
years I also have my own creative

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,709
practice this is a picture of me

00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:32,440
performing in a musical project called

00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:35,020
lullabies for AI which was about writing

00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,660
songs to teach our AI children how to

00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:40,349
love and exist in the world but really

00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:43,649
what I want to talk about today is p5.js

00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:46,959
something is near and dear to my heart

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:49,119
p5 is an open-source JavaScript library

00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,310
for creative coding the focus on making

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,530
coding accessible and inclusive and it's

00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,300
managed by this foundation called

00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,399
processing foundation is created by a

00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:00,069
person named Laura mccarthy about seven

00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:02,080
years ago and so you would use p5 to

00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:03,819
make interactive audio visual art so

00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:08,020
that means stuff like you know you can

00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:09,759
draw shapes you can do you can alter

00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,220
like videos and images you can do data

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,200
visualizations have some quick examples

00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:18,250
just so you can kind of see stuff made

00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:22,000
of p5 here's an example here's an

00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:24,129
example like a video shader you can also

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,019
make like an interactive movie poster

00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:28,680
just like this is you can do a lots lots

00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:28,680
and lots stuff

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:34,790
p5 was really inspiring to me because my

00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:37,250
background is in engineering and when I

00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:39,890
started when I first started learning

00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:43,340
how to code I was writing like command

00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,960
line applications in Java and like the

00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,440
whole thing was like really intimidating

00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,690
and scary to me and I felt like after I

00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,250
like spent all this time learning I like

00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,900
didn't actually know how to make

00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,730
anything and from ep5 was really

00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,280
inspiring that like I could know very

00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,320
little and be able to make a lot so I

00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,030
loved it so much that I started my own

00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,280
open-source project which was an

00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,470
in-browser code editor for p5 so the

00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,500
idea here is that like you really

00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,850
removed the barrier to entry for writing

00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,920
code or writing creative code and you

00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,750
just like have the code on left preview

00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,340
on the right could just like open this

00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,750
website and get started so this is what

00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:22,310
we're going to use to do some live

00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:26,120
coding so let's so I'm just gonna open

00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:28,430
the web editor and this is like the

00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,520
sketch that you get when you first open

00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:33,140
it I'm so I'm just gonna hit play and we

00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,720
can see what we get and we just got this

00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,790
like kind of boring gray square but

00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,570
let's like break down what we've done

00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:43,730
here or what what it gives us so first

00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:45,380
important line we have here is create

00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:47,150
canvas and this is creating like our

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,820
drawing a surface where we're gonna draw

00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,980
all of our visual elements it just takes

00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,989
like a width and a height as arguments

00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,700
so I could like make the speaker and

00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:57,410
then we'd have something bigger right

00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,320
and then we have a background and this

00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:02,690
is just like painting a whole big color

00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,030
like one color over the whole canvas and

00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:06,980
this argument that it takes is a color

00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,049
and this color can be like you can

00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,209
specify in a lot of different ways so if

00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:13,160
we just have a number then that's just a

00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:16,400
grayscale value right so if we put in 0

00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,200
it's gonna be black if we put in 255

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,269
it's gonna be white I'm if you're

00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,280
familiar with hexadecimal colors that

00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:24,440
255 is white if you're used to like

00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,600
using colors on the web like that you

00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,300
can also make it a red green blue value

00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,180
right so man if I just specify a red

00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,740
component and then if I put in you know

00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,600
I could put in a blue component and then

00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,700
it's gonna be like paint color but yeah

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,840
colors are just numbers and in fact like

00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:45,560
to our computer everything is numbers

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,060
eight images text video everything is

00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,960
just numbers and that's really one of

00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,610
the like exciting parts of creative

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,740
coding is that we can like take these

00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,300
different numbers and like map them and

00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,360
interpret them and use them in different

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,949
ways one other thing I want to note is

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,930
that there are these two functions set

00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:06,320
up and draw and these are being called

00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:09,110
behind the scenes by five piece by the

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,930
p5 library and so setup is being called

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:14,030
one time and draw is actually being

00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,370
called 60 times a second right it's just

00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,760
like constantly being executed over and

00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,050
over again

00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,200
it's what computers are good at and this

00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,630
is what allows us to make animations and

00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,120
and that kind of stuff

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:28,040
so now what I want to do is I want to

00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,660
add like an interactive element here and

00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,370
I just want to add like a really simple

00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,900
one so we can kind of understand it and

00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,610
then we can like keep building on this

00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,880
and this is how you might if you're just

00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:38,930
like starting working on it creative

00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,460
coding project how you might how you

00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,400
might just start so what I want to do is

00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,380
I want to draw a circle at the mouse

00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,229
position so the way I do that is they

00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:51,380
use circle function yeah that's that's

00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:54,139
right by p5 and then I can pass it takes

00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:56,690
like a X&Y position and a size so I'm

00:05:54,139 --> 00:06:00,320
just gonna put in the mouse x position

00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:02,240
this is a variable that's provided by p5

00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,770
it just specified every go draw loop

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,510
every time the draw loop gets run it

00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,330
gets updated I'm just gonna put in a

00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,400
size and we can like see oh you see I

00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,590
have this in the wrong order background

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,120
is getting drawn over it put this in the

00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,580
right order and now we can see our

00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,020
Sierra Circle right and if I move it

00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,700
around I have the circle following me

00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:23,210
and you're like okay Cassidy was so kind

00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:25,160
boring there with me so now I think it

00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:27,289
gets slightly more interesting when we

00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,120
move background up to the setup because

00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:31,250
then we have them were no longer like

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,190
painting over the canvas every frame and

00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:38,810
then we're able to like see this trail

00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:41,599
of me moving the mouse and you know

00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,130
actually it's actually like a bad it's

00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:45,320
like a bad drawing up and you kind of

00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,150
move the circle around faster and slower

00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,410
I mean you can like swing your eyes you

00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,330
could like see this like three

00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:53,300
dimensional tubes filter or something

00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,880
it's kind of cool but let's keep making

00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,250
this more interesting what I

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,350
do its I want to add some color to this

00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,120
and I want to have the color be affected

00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:03,370
by the mouse position right I'm kind of

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,320
doing like a one-to-one mapping here or

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,150
I'm just mapping the mouse position to

00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,430
like the position of the circle we can

00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:11,290
get a little more more fancy so let's

00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,970
change the color at the circle where

00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,620
that we do that is we use function

00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:17,770
called fill just fill color I'm gonna

00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:20,440
put in Mouse X for the red value and

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,570
let's gonna put in maximum for the green

00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,400
and blue let's see what that looks like

00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:27,250
so as I move the circle across the

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,150
canvas we see that all the way on the

00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:33,460
Left where the mouse x position is zero

00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,990
it's like it we can see just the the

00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,030
green and blue components and then as I

00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,890
move it to the right it's white because

00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,840
all of those colors some together is

00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:42,670
white but one interesting thing to

00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,910
notice about this is it actually changes

00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:49,420
to white like halfway through the canvas

00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:50,680
and that's not quite what I want right

00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,990
like I want this to be like a nice

00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,790
gradient all across and the reason that

00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:58,200
this is happening is because these two

00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:01,990
values the position of the mouse and

00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:04,180
colors have different ranges right the

00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,760
mouse position is a value between zero

00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:09,730
and the width of the canvas and colors

00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:12,160
are values between 0 and 255

00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:14,860
so we need to need to take the mouse

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,420
position and map it to the right range

00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:21,460
and the way that we do that is we use a

00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:22,510
function called map I'm saying what sort

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:27,040
of map and I couldn't think of it

00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:29,740
Red Dog equals Mac and so map takes five

00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,720
arguments one of which is the input and

00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,849
then the input range and then the output

00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,469
range so the minimum maximum and the

00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:38,349
minimum and maximum so this is going to

00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:40,210
be a value between 0 and rick p5 also

00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:42,340
just gives us width of the canvas py

00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:46,450
that's very nice to us gives us the

00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:49,720
things that we want and now as we move

00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:52,990
oh I have to actually use this variable

00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,490
rather than just define it and then it's

00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,900
we move the mouse across you can see

00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,540
that now we have like a nice gradient

00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:02,110
and we can like enjoy it even more maybe

00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,100
I'll remove the stroke around it ooh and

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,839
then we could like kind of draw around

00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,880
we got like a nice gradient so that's

00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:09,700
fun but now

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,160
I want to like keep playing with this I

00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:17,470
want to like use a different shape here

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:19,030
um I happen to like using line and I

00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,890
want to slide the line takes like a

00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:24,190
start and end position and I'm just

00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:25,750
gonna like offset the X the X the start

00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,610
act I'm gonna make it like you know

00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,260
you'll see what I mean level with the

00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,120
expert a little bit offset to the left

00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,990
and right so I'm gonna be Mouse X minus

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,180
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:42,790
now Y takes X Y X Y mouse X plus 50

00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:46,300
Mouse Y cool and we're not gonna see

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:48,670
anything because I removed the stroke

00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,290
and lines are an empty shape they have

00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:52,360
no fill they only have strokes I

00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:55,120
actually just need to like get rid of my

00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:59,680
circle and then I need to specify a

00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,510
stroke color if I just call stroke with

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,180
a color then I got a color now if I

00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:08,710
start drawing here yeah I get like a

00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:10,780
line but I'm not really I'm still not

00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:13,120
liking this variation in color I want to

00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:16,210
add a little bit more and so I'm going

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,520
to have the mouse Y control the green

00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:21,850
green position so then I'm going to

00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:26,380
change this to green brown make this

00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:28,150
mouse why make this type trait because Y

00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:31,060
is the value between 0 and height Y

00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,690
positive is actually down takes some

00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:35,200
getting used to

00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:37,450
it's actually really common and like

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,460
every everything digital I don't know

00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:41,590
did a lot of creative coding frameworks

00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,020
okay cool so now I'm getting more more

00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:46,240
color variation that I like it's kind of

00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:48,370
like a vapor wave the colors and I could

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,960
like play around with these color ranges

00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:52,300
and like see what I like I'm happy with

00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,220
this color range so I'm gonna keep going

00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,800
it's kind of nice as I like move my

00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:59,110
lying around I can see how like they

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,470
overlap and make these like textural

00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:03,910
shapes I'm liking this but now what I

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,940
want to do is I want to add some

00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:08,980
rotation to this line to like have a

00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:11,590
little bit more to see like what other

00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:14,820
kind of shapes arise there and so

00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:18,220
there's a Pew 5 function called rotate

00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:20,590
and it takes one argument that's an

00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:26,280
angle and it takes by

00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:29,800
fault radians which maybe is scary but

00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:31,450
but unfortunately in creative coding you

00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,450
have to do a lot of I feel like you have

00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:36,520
to do a lot of maths like I need to work

00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:39,220
arranging visual stuff on the screen

00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,900
it's like you have to do math and my

00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,400
students are always like oh no I thought

00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,320
we were avoiding math by going to art

00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,660
school I'm like hahaha you have to learn

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,670
trigonometry we have to remember trigger

00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:51,100
object okay well as I'm like are you

00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,960
trying to use this rotate it's like not

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,610
really working how I want like I wanted

00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,110
it to rotate the shape but like as I

00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,430
have my mouse over here it's like now

00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,960
it's position as well as you don't

00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,160
really understand what's happening while

00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,690
I'm pretending that I don't understand

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,570
something I do understand something I

00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,980
have an example here to show you so it's

00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,800
like offset in this weird way and so

00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:11,650
what's happening is so here's an example

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,320
where I'm rotating a rectangle at the

00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:17,650
origin I've actually translated the

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,750
origin here to the centre of the screen

00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:22,300
and so we'll see if the second square

00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:24,040
which is the blue one I've rotated it PI

00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,900
over four like the same amount 45

00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,790
degrees and we'll see that it rotates in

00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,380
place right when you rotate rotate

00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:32,950
something at the urge and it just

00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:36,310
rotates the shape but if you move the

00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:37,900
rectangle out from the axis so here I'm

00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:40,450
gonna I'm setting the x and y position

00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,730
so the red one is the unrotated one

00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:44,050
that's connected with the black axes and

00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:47,350
the blue one is the rotator one you see

00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:50,380
how like it's XY position gets moved and

00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:52,150
so that's what's happening in our inner

00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,250
sketch now I don't want that to happen I

00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:57,040
wanted to get rotated in place so then

00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:59,770
what I need to do is translate the axes

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:03,280
to the mouse X and mouse Y position now

00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:05,920
six that's why right and then what I

00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:09,600
need to do is then draw the line back at

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:15,430
the origin so then I get rid of the zero

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:18,400
makes this zero get rid of you get rid

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:24,610
of you oh I got put a zero here actually

00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:30,310
so cool what did I do wrong what did I

00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:33,550
do wrong what's happening cute

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,329
Oh negative 52 50 I was like the line

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:39,369
had nose

00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:41,410
sighs okay cool so now I have a rotated

00:13:39,369 --> 00:13:43,239
line this is fun but it's kind of just

00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:47,230
like the same thing that we were doing

00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:49,540
but it's like tilted yeah but now I want

00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:51,249
to now that I'm like able to rotate it

00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,110
how I want I want to like have the

00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:54,790
rotation change with the mouse X and

00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,759
last by position so let's create a new

00:13:54,790 --> 00:14:00,309
variable called rotation when you use

00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,259
our trusty friend map again

00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:05,379
what do you mass Y which I know is a

00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:09,549
value between 0 and height and let's map

00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:15,759
it to a value between 0 and pi pi is

00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:17,799
also just provided by p5 so now I can

00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,720
get some squiggly shapes as I move my

00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:25,059
mouse and that's fun I could try making

00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:26,799
this like 2 pi I'm like honestly if I'm

00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:27,939
like playing around with mapping it's

00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,589
something like this like I don't I'm not

00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:31,299
like thinking about this too hard I just

00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:33,129
kind of like put in a random number and

00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:34,509
just like see what it looks like it's

00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:36,759
really nice that like you can just write

00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:38,170
code you know and then just like

00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:39,339
immediately see what it looks like and

00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,139
be like oh that looks good that looks

00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:42,759
bad and that's just really common in

00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:45,160
creative coding okay like how this kind

00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:50,949
of had this like san shape comics like a

00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:52,629
leaf or something cool so now I could

00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:56,309
also try playing around with like the

00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:58,779
line size I want the line to be breaker

00:14:56,309 --> 00:15:02,439
300 and then I kind of get like a

00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:05,230
totally different um different effect so

00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:07,029
now like I don't like that every time I

00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,470
do this I have to like move my mouse

00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:10,569
around to test it I just want to hit

00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:14,049
play and I had the computer do the work

00:15:10,569 --> 00:15:16,089
for me and so that's a really nice thing

00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:19,299
about I'm using computers and you're

00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:20,470
when you're trying to make visual art is

00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:22,360
that you can just hit play a bunch of

00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,309
times and like see what it generates and

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,449
pick the ones that you pick the ones

00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:27,129
that you like it's like you're laying

00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:28,899
the computer do the hard work doing what

00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:30,999
it's good at and you can also have it

00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:32,619
like have some randomness so every time

00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:35,079
you hit play it does something different

00:15:32,619 --> 00:15:36,910
and then pick the good ones and so the

00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:39,100
way that I want this like the line

00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:42,009
position to move is I have this like

00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,779
bouncing ball example and I want it to

00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:45,669
like just bounce around the canvas like

00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:47,160
this and rotate around and we'll kind of

00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:49,170
see what that looks like

00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,899
and because I already have this example

00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:54,690
like I'm not like you know it's all this

00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:57,180
is doing is really just like it has some

00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:59,190
x and y position and it's just updating

00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,529
the speed every it's updating the

00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:03,600
position with the speed and then when it

00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:05,490
hits the wall it's just reversing the X

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,129
speed or the Y speed it's pretty it's

00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,779
pretty simple and really like I don't

00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:11,490
want to think about how to do this again

00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:13,860
like I'm unlike I know those code works

00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:18,209
so I'm just going to go back to my

00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:22,319
example and paste it only thing to do is

00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:24,240
merge my setups so I don't have to set

00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:27,810
up functions the one that comes second

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,490
is the one that's gonna override okay so

00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:31,110
now I have this and if I hit play

00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:35,220
they're just gonna be the things I

00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:37,350
haven't connected it at all I also need

00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:40,829
my code that's in my draw loop that's

00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:47,939
doing all the updating so it's gonna

00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:49,680
copy that go to my draw loop and now so

00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:51,180
this is my code that's updating the

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,939
position and this is the code that's

00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,949
making it bounce off the walls and in

00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:59,130
the other example I had the circle that

00:16:55,949 --> 00:17:00,990
had a diameter but my line has no

00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:03,089
diameter I just wanted to directly hit

00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:06,089
the wall and so in this case D is zero

00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:08,699
so I can just get rid of these these or

00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:10,169
set it to zero where it makes sense okay

00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:12,659
so now if I hit play it's still not

00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:14,459
working because I haven't actually

00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:18,150
connected it so what I need to do is

00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:20,309
change this to X check every time I have

00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:25,199
mouse X or Mouse Y got to change it to

00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:27,990
Mouse X or change it to X or Y whoo okay

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,330
so now I can just like let it hit play

00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:32,280
and just like see what happens that's

00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:36,690
kind of fun I really like how it looks

00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:41,570
if this speed it's a little bit slower

00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:43,770
or like that let's see how that looks

00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:45,960
yeah and you have it slower you get

00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:48,000
these more a patterns that I really like

00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:53,490
because the the line is then closer

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:56,820
together yeah this is fun this feels

00:17:53,490 --> 00:18:01,220
like this feels like math textbook

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:03,020
energy would be like multivariate

00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,620
oculus third edition or something I

00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:08,600
don't know cool so I hope this has given

00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:10,580
you an example of how you might just

00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,880
like start from something really really

00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:15,890
simple and like iterate on an idea and

00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,720
just like play it around if I hit play a

00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:19,520
bunch of times I could get totally

00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,630
different things oh this is cool like

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,190
how it's just spinning in the center

00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,990
whoo I could like take a screenshot

00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:27,080
there and be like this is my art piece

00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:29,030
you can really generate cool ideas but

00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,890
now I want to show you how to take like

00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:32,570
different types of inputs and how you

00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,570
might just like take some code that

00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:37,309
maybe you don't know and just like put

00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:39,470
like just sort of like plug different

00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:42,830
things together and also work with

00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:46,549
libraries that you maybe don't know so

00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:51,470
what I want to do is I have this example

00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:52,270
that is in one of the p5 examples and

00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,950
like where'd I put it

00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:56,929
and what it is is that it's really

00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:59,630
simple synthesizers so like when I just

00:18:56,929 --> 00:19:01,700
press the mouse it like plays a sound

00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:04,429
and just changing the mouse position

00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:08,419
changes the amplitude and frequency I'm

00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:10,549
like this is great I want it and then

00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:13,490
what I want to do is I want this

00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:15,110
synthesizer to be controlled by my face

00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:20,230
what I want to happen it's like when I

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:23,179
open my mouth I want to play a note so

00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:25,640
how do I do that well luckily there's

00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:28,580
this JavaScript library called CLM

00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,020
tracker that I know is really easy to

00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,120
use and really great doing face tracking

00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:33,799
so I'm like cool I can kind of look at

00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,360
this documentation I see it gives me a

00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:38,150
bunch of points for like where my mouth

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,340
and eyes are and stuff I'm just going to

00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:41,990
need to figure out like the distance my

00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:45,730
mouth opens right song I need to like

00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:48,740
measure the distance between 60 and 57

00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:51,020
and I have some example code and so here

00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:54,470
I have open the CDN so I can just like

00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:58,820
copy it to my sketch I can then put it

00:19:54,470 --> 00:20:00,620
in my HTML yeah so this on the right is

00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,350
actually a hole it's like a whole web

00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:06,409
page just running in an iframe here so

00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:08,720
yeah that's how I add new files to my

00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:09,169
sketch and if I hit play nothing's gonna

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,700
happen

00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:12,169
well actually I need to get my face

00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,690
input right like I'm not getting my

00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:17,390
video in here so what I need to do

00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:19,610
create function your variable called

00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:24,380
capture I'm actually gonna change

00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:27,050
I want my the sizer to be a sawtooth

00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:30,710
instead I think it's more annoying and I

00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:33,200
like that so I'm gonna do capture equals

00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:35,240
create capture this is another function

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,140
probably by p5 that allows us to get

00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:46,880
video input and then I'm gonna do

00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:48,950
capture got size 400 225 so now we can

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,620
see there's my face and double because

00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,150
you can also see my face over this thing

00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:55,160
and then what I want to do is you can

00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,750
see that it's like not on the canvas and

00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:00,950
that's because this actually creates a

00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:03,440
totally different video element on the

00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:05,680
screen it's like it's like a literally a

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,600
video tag I'm doing this for triangle

00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:11,900
HTML element so I want to draw it to the

00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:16,810
canvas and so let's first set my canvas

00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:19,610
to the same size and then I'm gonna do

00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:23,150
use the image function this draws an

00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:25,610
image to the p5 canvas at some position

00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:31,850
all I have to do is pass the image or

00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:33,620
video capture 0 0 and then we see now I

00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:40,190
have two of me and I can like hide the

00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:42,020
other one capture dot kind so now now if

00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:43,460
I click on my face I have the

00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:47,240
synthesizer here I don't want any of

00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:49,190
this text here okay so now I have my

00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:53,300
face and then I need to get the points

00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:55,490
in my face and I know I'm gonna need to

00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:59,270
like somehow plug it into this amplitude

00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:01,250
and frequency right um so now what I

00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:03,230
want to do is go to my face tracking

00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,780
thing and I want to just get the starter

00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:10,430
code so I'm just gonna copy this it's

00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:12,800
the initialization code then I have my

00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:17,900
tracker I want to make this a global

00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:20,570
variable I like can't even let a var

00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,650
exist in the world I'm like a bar is

00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:25,840
evil

00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:27,690
it must not exist so I initialize it

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,570
emit and then

00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:32,250
I have a I need to connect my video

00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:33,840
input this was just the video input from

00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,600
the example so then I need to put

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:40,350
capture a perfect captured got me LT

00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:44,070
because P 5 has its own wrapper for Dom

00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:45,720
elements okay so now I have this and I'm

00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:48,779
still not gonna see anything's I'm not

00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:52,740
actually getting my face points so that

00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:56,039
I need to go here and this is the line

00:22:52,740 --> 00:23:00,860
code I need this is the friend that I

00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:05,250
need I'm going to come back here go into

00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:07,019
my draw loop and have called this line

00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,330
and then what I want to do is I want to

00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:10,950
iterate through all of the positions it

00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:14,039
gives me like however my positions like

00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:16,110
60 something and draw like little

00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:20,220
circles on all them so we can like

00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:22,139
visualize those points so I'm going to

00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,940
need to do I have to put this in it and

00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:27,210
this is just a thing that I know from

00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:29,399
running through this a bunch of times is

00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:31,590
that positions doesn't get defined and

00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:35,039
maybe at least you have to just oh sorry

00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:37,740
you have to do it like this because I

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,360
want to do positions dot for each and it

00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:42,120
was like people ignoring the errors like

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:47,250
positions is not fine but I'm gonna save

00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:49,110
you I'm gonna save you that okay so yeah

00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:51,419
I have my for each loop and then I want

00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:54,029
to draw a circle each point so first I

00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:58,740
need to set my fill color I'm just gonna

00:23:54,029 --> 00:24:02,220
make red then I need to set I'm gonna be

00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:03,539
no stroke and then I'm gonna draw a

00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:08,789
circle at the point so I'm gonna do

00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:11,120
circle positions at zero positions at

00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:14,389
one so the way this positions array

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,980
works is that it's an array of

00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:21,539
two-dimensional arrays where 0 as X and

00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:25,080
1 is y so I'm just gonna be circle 0 0 5

00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:29,220
and be real tiny of course let's see oh

00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:30,240
if I think I spelled it wrong positions

00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,190
Wow

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,350
I made up a new variable ok cool so now

00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:36,850
let's see if that working a has my face

00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:39,820
points

00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:43,430
so that's fun so now I need two unlit

00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:46,280
allure this three

00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:48,920
now I need to figure out what my mouse

00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:54,590
distance is and so the way that I do

00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:56,450
that is I need points 60 and 57 I need

00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:58,130
to like find the distance between them

00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,900
and I can't just subtract the Y

00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:02,150
components I need to like do some vector

00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:04,220
math like if my face is tilted but

00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:05,660
luckily I can just let p5 do all the

00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,460
vector math for me and I don't have to

00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:09,950
think about it so what I need to do is

00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:12,820
create two variables mouth top and mouth

00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:21,880
bottom this is going to be create vector

00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:26,929
it's gonna be positioned at 60 0 at 61

00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:30,260
it's bigger so you can see it and then

00:25:26,929 --> 00:25:37,309
I'm gonna do the same thing but mouth

00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:39,140
bottom but it's gonna be 57 57 then I

00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:41,780
just need to get the vector difference

00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:43,760
and magnitude of that difference to get

00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:47,780
the distance of the mouth so I'm gonna

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:54,380
do Const mouth fist it's gonna be now

00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:58,070
top dot subtract now bottom got neg and

00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:59,720
this is all p5 functions this is all p5

00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:01,640
vector stuff so now what I want to do is

00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,429
like I need to figure out what the range

00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:07,910
is for my mouth and this is God

00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:12,100
screenshot that so what I need to do is

00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:15,170
just like see what range of values I get

00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,640
and so this is this is really common

00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:18,530
when you're trying to work with some

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,090
kind of input for in your creative

00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:21,170
coding projects you've got to like see

00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:23,920
what your range looks like and usually

00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:26,870
notice like print it to the console

00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:30,460
mouth yeah it's because Mouse dist is

00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:30,460
not defined now

00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,400
you

00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:43,590
okay so it seems like it's a number from

00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:48,810
like 3 to 17 I can't talk well I'm - I'm

00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:52,080
trying that out okay so now we have our

00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:55,860
values Oh so I need to make this global

00:26:52,080 --> 00:27:01,260
and to do let or more global announced

00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:04,260
bist don't need to print it out anymore

00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:08,220
and then I just need to connect it so

00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:12,480
let's connect it to the amplitudes and

00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,860
then I can just do mouth now fist which

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,270
I know it's a value what did I say it

00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:22,830
was between like 3 and 17 I'll make it 4

00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:26,870
to 17 I'm gonna make this value between

00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:30,500
0 and 0.5 in case it's like really loud

00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:38,820
okay okay Mona truth

00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:41,860
[Music]

00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:43,750
nice and I have this like kind of stupid

00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:46,030
mount synthesizer but it literally took

00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:48,550
me like 10 minutes to make but it was

00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:50,290
pretty exciting and this you know I

00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:51,640
could make this much more exciting and

00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:53,740
like make the sound elements more

00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,330
exciting I could use like a better base

00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:59,230
tracker this is just the easiest one to

00:27:55,330 --> 00:28:02,620
use but I could also maybe connect it to

00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:04,270
the frequency to good try let's try that

00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:11,820
we could do just do the same thing Mouse

00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:11,820
fist which is a number between 4 and 17

00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:22,400
[Music]

00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:23,980
so yeah that's your mouth synthesizer

00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,510
project

00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:28,580
cool I hope you've enjoyed learning how

00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:33,260
to make visual art and a weird mouth

00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:35,810
synthesizer um cool so now I want to go

00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:37,930
just sort of have some closing remarks

00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:42,020
here

00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:44,870
well I've sort of summarized my points

00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:46,070
about creative coding in the slide that

00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:48,200
you probably can't read if you want to

00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:49,880
like screenshot it and take it read it

00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,800
later but really I've tried to cover

00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,270
just like some of the basic stuff you

00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,970
would do in creative coding and a lot of

00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:57,290
these principles apply to any creative

00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:00,260
coding environment whether it be

00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:04,100
something like open frameworks or

00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:07,880
Maximus P or Sonic PI or shaders or

00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:11,090
whatever all all applies I want to

00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,680
encourage you to learn p5 which I love

00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:14,720
so much this is a screenshot from a

00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,040
YouTube channel called the coding tram

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,540
just talked by a person named Dan

00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,740
Schiffman who's on the on the board of

00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:20,600
frosting foundation and makes really

00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,270
amazing toriel's but there's tons of

00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,460
other ways to learn like you can read

00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:30,260
there's examples on the p5 website so

00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:32,540
many books I also encourage you to join

00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:35,480
the p5 community which just really

00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:37,190
inspires me every day this is a picture

00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,200
from the p5 contributors conference

00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:42,890
which happened this past august at

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,110
carnegie mellon see here's just a really

00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:47,000
amazing opportunity to meet in person

00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:48,320
these are a lot of people who I like

00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,410
talked to you over the internet over

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:53,090
github a lot as I'm working on the web

00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:55,370
editor it's really awesome to see

00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:57,970
everyone in person I also encourage you

00:29:55,370 --> 00:30:01,430
to contribute if you have wanted to

00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:02,840
contribute to open source tools this is

00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:05,600
a great place to start it's a really

00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:07,250
friendly and open community and there's

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,340
so many different ways to contribute you

00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:12,170
can contribute code but contributing to

00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:15,470
open source is not just writing code you

00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:18,050
can do you can do documentation you can

00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:20,030
teach you can create you can also just

00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:21,890
donate money if you want to donate money

00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:24,350
to processing foundation and keep this

00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:25,740
project going p5 and the web editor

00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:27,419
highly recommend

00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,059
