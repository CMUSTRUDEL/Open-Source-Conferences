	Presented by Cassie Tarakajian

Have you written code before, but never thought about how it could be used for art? What are the artistic possibilities for software? This session will introduce the foundational concepts of creative coding through p5.js, a JavaScript library with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else. This session will explore how software techniques, such as algorithms, randomness, data, and interactivity can be applied to creative work. Familiarity with JavaScript or code syntax is recommended.

Cassie Tarakajian (they/them) is a technologist and artist based in Brooklyn, New York. Their work focuses on creative tools, working as an engineer at Cycling ’74 and as the lead developer and maintainer on the open source p5.js Web Editor. They also teach creative coding workshops and classes, and serve as an adjunct professor at NYU ITP. Past artistic projects range from generating sonnets from Wikipedia contributions to teaching computers how to love as a member of the band Lullabies for AI.

GitHub Satellite: A community connected by code

On May 6th, we threw a free virtual event featuring developers working together on the world’s software, announcements from the GitHub team, and inspiring performances by artists who code.
