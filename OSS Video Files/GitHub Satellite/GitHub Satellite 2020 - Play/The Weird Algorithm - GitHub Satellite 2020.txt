Title: The Weird Algorithm - GitHub Satellite 2020
Publication date: 2020-05-07

Description: 
	The Weird Algorithm is a program that creates KARAOKE MASHUPS by 
replacing the lyrics to a SONG with matching lines from a specific 
SOURCE TEXT.  For example: 'I Want It That Way' with replacement lines 
from Mean Girls, or 'Mr. Brightside' with lines from Craigslist ads. In 
this session, we will combine songs and texts based on audience requests
 and then sing the generated results live.

Jamie Brew is a writer and software engineer living in Seattle. He runs 
the creative technology group Botnik and was previously a writer and 
editor at The Onion and Clickhole.
