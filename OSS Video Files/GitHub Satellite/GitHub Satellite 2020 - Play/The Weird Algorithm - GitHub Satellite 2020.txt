Title: The Weird Algorithm - GitHub Satellite 2020
Publication date: 2020-05-07
Playlist: GitHub Satellite 2020 - Play
Description: 
	The Weird Algorithm is a program that creates KARAOKE MASHUPS by 
replacing the lyrics to a SONG with matching lines from a specific 
SOURCE TEXT.  For example: 'I Want It That Way' with replacement lines 
from Mean Girls, or 'Mr. Brightside' with lines from Craigslist ads. In 
this session, we will combine songs and texts based on audience requests
 and then sing the generated results live.

Jamie Brew is a writer and software engineer living in Seattle. He runs 
the creative technology group Botnik and was previously a writer and 
editor at The Onion and Clickhole.

GitHub Satellite: A community connected by code

On May 6th, we threw a free virtual event featuring developers working together on the worldâ€™s software, announcements from the GitHub team, and inspiring performances by artists who code.

00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,660
you

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,580
okay

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,390
revive

00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:38,370
hello this is Jamie brew I am happy to

00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:41,640
be here in my room and also somehow at

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,950
the github satellite conference um thank

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,040
you for having me I'm representing

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,739
banach which is a tech company one of

00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,760
the big four tech companies and today

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:56,600
we're gonna be showing we're gonna be

00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,540
stepping through a few songs in the

00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:03,480
karaoke mashup generation program that I

00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:07,100
called the weird algorithm and what it

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:10,350
does is takes a song that you know and

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:13,259
then take some source text that could be

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,720
anything and replaces every line for

00:01:13,259 --> 00:01:18,390
that song with a line from the source

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,360
text and in doing this we're trying to

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,310
do what Weird Al does maybe put we're

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,830
down a lot of a job so we call it the

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,500
weird algorithm and it was actually

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:33,450
inspired by a story that I heard about

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:36,450
the Beatles song yesterday yesterday we

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,310
all know now is one of the most

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,670
beautiful meditations on loss ever

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,770
committed to music and words but in its

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,789
first draft yesterday had different

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:50,520
lyrics that at some point got replaced

00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:54,000
and those first lyrics were I think I'm

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,980
quoting right here scrambled eggs oh my

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,620
baby how I love your legs

00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:02,380
and you know that got they got switched

00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:05,140
into a very different song so the

00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:08,380
question we want to ask is to other

00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:11,230
songs contain in them possible

00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:16,360
yesterday's and can we extract those

00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:19,000
beautiful new songs using algorithms so

00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,920
the way the weird algorithm works is we

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,150
first choose a song so we're going to

00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:28,360
choose yesterday and then you choose

00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:30,460
experts text of lines to serve serve as

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,000
possibly in placements plays lines on

00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:39,700
the song I'm gonna choose

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,880
Yelp Realtors use of psychophysics and

00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,390
the other sundry screen I'm gonna pull

00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:53,050
up pull up

00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:56,980
a karaoke for Asians yesterday and then

00:02:53,050 --> 00:03:00,240
and then forget sing sing so this is

00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,240
necessary networking works

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,430
[Music]

00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:20,550
I will apply listen clients for way that

00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:28,270
is pretty much all I can say every year

00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:32,980
for my birthday normally she went over

00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:39,000
the price plans with me I love how the

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:41,000
school's motto could be no problem

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,480
understandable

00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,510
I don't need to know please don't go 4

00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,510
grand

00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:58,890
to be wrong she took my name

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:08,909
anyway and I mean that in the nicest way

00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:18,540
so I went and checked out their display

00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:18,540
she did not ask my

00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:28,290
[Music]

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,290
letting go as of today

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,810
[Music]

00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:38,460
boy what she run

00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:41,200
[Music]

00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,800
energize

00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,400
my back pain too

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,400
went away

00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,980
literally

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,180
I had a session yesterday

00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,349
[Music]

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:08,450
yesterday with new lyrics from Yelp

00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:10,310
reviews of psychics so this is the game

00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:13,160
we're playing every time with the weird

00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:16,610
algorithm we were taking a song that we

00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:19,490
know and finding lines that are

00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,830
compatible with the same syllable

00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:25,520
pattern and rhyme scheme from the

00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:29,270
original song as best as we can so let's

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,729
run it again and one of the points I

00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:33,529
want to show here is that

00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:36,050
switching the swords text and keeping

00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:40,210
the same algorithm we can get wildly

00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:43,720
different results so for the second one

00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,980
I'm gonna choose

00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,660
now what are we going to choose here

00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,660
let's do mr. Brightside

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,370
and since this is github satellite let's

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,069
do something to do with tech we have to

00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,060
here and maybe we can get to them both

00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:01,669
programming interview questions from

00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,169
lead code and tech company Terms of

00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:06,580
Service

00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:10,539
let's do tech company Terms of Service

00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:13,629
something compatible with mr. Brightside

00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:18,039
expand that to get the SVR out right and

00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:18,039
go get our mr. inside

00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:30,979
okay here's mr. Brightside with tech

00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:33,860
company in terms of service the devices

00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:36,589

00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:40,459
you comply with these terms

00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:43,519
those points will be Skype makes no

[Music]

00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:08,680
and that's mr. Brightside with a lot of

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:11,290
lyrics about services from a collection

00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:16,810
of tech company terms of service from

00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:19,840
some of the big four so one thing about

00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:21,460
this program is every time we run it it

00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,800
will be yielding something different

00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:26,320
because it's got some randomness built

00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,500
into the choice of which of the many

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,060
lines that could fit a particular loan

00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,560
we actually choose so we could run that

00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:36,010
again and get something different we

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:39,340
could also try loading in a completely

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:41,350
new song or a new source text and and

00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:43,540
running it to get a song that we've

00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:48,280
never heard before so I took some

00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:51,790
suggestions before this act and got the

00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,350
suggestion of the Big Lebowski loading

00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:57,220
in the script for the Big Lebowski

00:10:53,350 --> 00:11:00,460
so what's it as an exercise track down

00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,110
The Big Lebowski and try that as the

00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:06,280
replacement source text for one of these

00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:09,880
songs I'm gonna just search for The Big

00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:13,420
Lebowski go to it internet movie script

00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:16,800
database reliable places to get scripts

00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,800
indeed it's there

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,290
copy all of this text

00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:36,340
in a text file oh I am clumsy with the

00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:36,340
keyboard on the big call okay

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,560
so let's put this in a text file and if

00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,550
you want to just get the lines from the

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,180
Big Lebowski

00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:48,210
then we can do a little bit of custom

00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:52,260
text cleaning so we can see

00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:55,530
let's eliminate lines that have four

00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:57,200
tabs at the start but I did all of those

00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:00,350
in sublime text

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,350
very good

00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:06,990
we can also pull out all the lines that

00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:09,380
have two tabs at the start by finding

00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,380
those

00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:19,040
[Music]

00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:19,040
these lines in a new text file and

00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:24,660
and get rid of those ten second line

00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:29,100
breaks

00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:32,580
I think we should be left with here

00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,529
is a file of just the lines in the Big

00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:38,779
Lebowski

00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:47,420
we can now save this now as a text file

00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:47,420
in your movie spirits text

00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:57,860
[Music]

00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:57,860
add that to our tests

00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:00,149
you

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,260
see

00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,260
roots

00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:23,449
this should not be an option

00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:25,429
replace lines from any song with lines

00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:27,459
from the Big Lebowski so let's give it a

00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,459
whirl

00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,390
let's do it with

00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:42,100
to do it was I wanted out

00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:42,100
we get lines from Big Lebowski

00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,650
it's like it worked it okay

00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,910
let's go find a karaoke version

00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:01,940
yes before so without further ado here

00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:04,330
is I want it that way with only lines

00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,980
 rude

00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:20,350
so let me make something clean here we

00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:24,120
are

00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:24,120
I like the way

00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,539
[Music]

00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:35,880
and this guy is

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,880
me

00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:42,350
you

00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:45,530
okay that is I want it that way with

00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:46,910
lines from The Big Lebowski we probably

00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,660
have time for at least a couple more

00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:51,560
songs

00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:55,160
so another requests that that I have

00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:56,780
received is for the song shallow which I

00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,880
think I've heard enough

00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:03,710
just out in the wild to have picked up

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:07,870
uh and to try to fake my way along to so

00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:07,870
let's go get the lyrics for shallow

00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:17,160
these into the other module of this

00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:20,400
program where we're collecting not

00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:23,540
source texts but songs you can make a

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,830
new text file the shallow and we can

00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:28,110
just go through and make sure the line

00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:30,240
breaks over all right we want to split

00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:32,810
up any lines so that they are separately

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,810
searched for

00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:42,070
Thanks

00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:42,070
these lines

00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,880
easier they're shorter

00:18:46,649 --> 00:18:51,210
if it's a childhood text

00:18:52,910 --> 00:19:02,700
it's gonna run a little utility function

00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:04,620
right this format we need it will ask us

00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,870
questions for lines it's not sure about

00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:11,180
we have to manually input stress

00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:11,180
patterns so tell me something girl

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,830
searching for

00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:19,869
and change

00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:27,060
shallow wrist Lady gaga

00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:39,670
we're

00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:42,310
again and now choose number nine shallow

00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:45,250
I want to put next to shallow

00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:47,500
maybe this is a time for our other tech

00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,890
source we can do programming interview

00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:54,550
questions so these are little exercises

00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:57,660
from from programming interviews things

00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,660
that you might be challenged

00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,430
titles of those problems become the

00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:07,860
possible replacement source lines for a

00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:11,370
song and we're going to give it a whirl

00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:13,080
oh that doesn't look great that looks

00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:16,740
like it has a line that didn't find a

00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:19,289
match so let's give it a larger source

00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:22,580
text any shallow as a weird song to find

00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:22,580
search text replacements for

00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:30,150
programming interview questions let's do

00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:30,150
transcripts from the x-files

00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,519

00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,039

00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:16,120
now this kind of works so duo and I do

00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,120
let's get some dinner

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:27,110

00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:36,710
do I nothing

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:46,730
while girls good at music you're a so

00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:06,240
it's the real McCoy

00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:25,339
not a cloud in the sky you can tell what

00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:25,339
are you for he's probably going to I got

00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:32,980
are you sure you didn't cut yourself

00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:36,099
only

00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,099
[Music]

00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:44,930
I'm asking you to get yourself

00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,930
[Music]

00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:59,580
that is a puzzle

00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:01,760
get on the bus I can't really talk right

00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,760
now

00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,230
isn't that what

00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:16,150
[Music]

00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,150
Quinten what's the

00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:20,290
you come by this knowledge

00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,960

00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:33,149
ah

00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:39,009
I don't know

00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:42,279
[Music]

00:23:39,009 --> 00:23:42,279
comes back

00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:47,280
I'm not leave

00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:50,570
how can we get

00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,570
I'll take a look

00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:55,020
yeah just

00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:10,599
[Music]

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:24,880
we don't know who to trust now

00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:29,440
[Music]

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:32,830
okay that one all right there's shallow

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,230
with x-files replacement lines and as an

00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:37,810
exercise you can guess which one of

00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:40,000
those lines from the x-files belongs to

00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:41,860
Mulder and which one belongs to skeleton

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,530
I think those are the only two

00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:50,080
represented in that source text let's

00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:52,990
see how the other things we can do with

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,480
this program is discover the lyrics to

00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:58,000
songs that don't have lyrics so we can

00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:01,620
take an instrumental or orchestral piece

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:06,340
like the main theme for our words and

00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:08,410
search for lines that have same listen

00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:10,090
we can annotate the stresses so that we

00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,800
can also search for what feels I'm

00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:16,230
getting that's the right stress pattern

00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:19,710
so let's do the Star Wars and

00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:22,279
let's replace that with Jeopardy

00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,279
categories

00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,480
and for this one I think we can do it a

00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,820
cappella we don't need a karaoke track

00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,890
you just need to remember how the star

00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:34,620
boards main theme goes and if you know

00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:36,410
it we want to sing along at home as with

00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:40,230
all of these songs you're welcome to

00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:43,460
this is the Star Wars main theme with

00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,460
replacement lyrics from jeopardy

there in the middle but I've got hard to

00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:39,040
sing at the end but there's Star Wars

00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:41,470
with only jeopardy categories as the

00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,779
replacement not even replacement lyrics

00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:46,480
is the new lyrics

00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:49,750
so it's one that never had

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,840
um let's see it looks like we're closing

00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:55,049
in on the end here so why don't we break

00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,049
out

00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:02,700
where I'd request

00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:05,700
requested source text from the crowd but

00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:08,609
thank since it's a one-way street here

00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:11,029
and I'm just streaming into the void I'm

00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:14,339
gonna have to make the call

00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:17,909
let's do craigslist ads for vehicles

00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:19,709
it's my favorite source it's pretty big

00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:22,830
so it sometimes takes a little while to

00:27:19,709 --> 00:27:27,059
load which means this might be a good

00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:29,789
time to thank everyone out there in this

00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:34,589
love you've been a lovely crowd very

00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:38,459
quiet and respectful and to say thanks

00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:41,549
to give up burn posting all this and

00:27:38,459 --> 00:27:44,899
thanks to all of these very popular pop

00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:49,619
musicians for writing these songs that

00:27:44,899 --> 00:27:52,940
we are harvesting karaoke joy that's

00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:52,940
good towards the heart

00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:01,309
are you Persian it is the karaoke

00:27:58,129 --> 00:28:03,919
version okay I think that means we're

00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:05,809
ready to go now that you've seen the

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,649
ASCII all right you can move it back to

00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,649
the convenient size

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,960
means with that

00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,820
with this one what I'm gonna leave you

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,859

00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:21,960
has been the weird algorithm I'm Jamie

00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:26,009
brew and someday I hope to see you in

00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:30,289
some sort to do this together

00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:42,650
drive around Carter than in Florida and
