Publication date: 2019-05-29
Playlist: GitHub Satellite 2019 Connect Stage
Description: 
	Presented by Isabel Drost-Fromm, Open Source Strategist, Europace AG

Europace AG, a Berlin-based FinTech company, has been piloting innersource efforts for over two years. During that time, they've followed and contributed to innersourcecommons.org, a global, cross-organization initiative to further innersource practices that “apply the lessons of open source to all software engineering, using collaboration and transparency to increase quality, speed, and developer joy”.

This session will take your team on a journey from innersource as a vague idea to an organization that embraces open source collaboration techniques with developers who contribute to open source projects themselves.
