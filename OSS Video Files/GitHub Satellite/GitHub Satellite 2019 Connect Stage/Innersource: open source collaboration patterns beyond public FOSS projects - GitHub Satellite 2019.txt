Title: Innersource: open source collaboration patterns beyond public FOSS projects - GitHub Satellite 2019
Publication date: 2019-05-29
Playlist: GitHub Satellite 2019 Connect Stage
Description: 
	Presented by Isabel Drost-Fromm, Open Source Strategist, Europace AG

Europace AG, a Berlin-based FinTech company, has been piloting innersource efforts for over two years. During that time, they've followed and contributed to innersourcecommons.org, a global, cross-organization initiative to further innersource practices that “apply the lessons of open source to all software engineering, using collaboration and transparency to increase quality, speed, and developer joy”.

This session will take your team on a journey from innersource as a vague idea to an organization that embraces open source collaboration techniques with developers who contribute to open source projects themselves.

00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:14,199
[Music]

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,810
hello and welcome to my presentation on

00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:20,050
inner source which is about open source

00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:23,740
collaboration taken beyond just open

00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:26,110
source projects for the past 15 years

00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,989
I've spent my time in the Apache

00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:31,540
Software Foundation ecosystem what I've

00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:33,550
seen there is how open source projects

00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:36,510
manage to build bridges that are

00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:40,149
crossing time zones geographies but also

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:42,070
organizations for the past two years

00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:44,200
I've had a chance to bring that

00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:47,260
collaboration knowledge into a company

00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,989
called arrow pace here in Berlin working

00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:53,560
to enable teams to work across

00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:55,660
boundaries and across silos what I'm

00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,630
going to tell you today is our story of

00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,640
the past two years the lessons that

00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:04,989
we've learned and the principles that

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:08,020
we've discovered so I happen to be open

00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:09,729
so strategist at our pacer game but I am

00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:14,590
also a member of SIA patches of her

00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:17,470
foundation a couple years ago actually

00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:19,810
ten years ago I wanted to have a few

00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:25,690
friends travel to Berlin for my birthday

00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:28,600
I wanted to have their employers pay for

00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:31,240
the trip how do you do that you create a

00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,510
conference on also in search scalability

00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,250
no sequel and analytics which was Berlin

00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:38,560
buzzwords I did that together we see

00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,830
online out who is here today and Simon

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,400
will narrow next edition will be

00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:48,369
mid-june here in Berlin I also created a

00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,290
conference called Faust backstage which

00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:52,150
essentially brings together people from

00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:55,630
the Linux Foundation Apache Software

00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:58,090
Foundation Eclipse Foundation as well as

00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:01,630
individuals to discuss all things

00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:06,579
open-source economics open source legal

00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:08,259
and opens us governance this talk was

00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:12,010
done in collaboration with Tobias

00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:13,420
possession sitting right here he's a

00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:16,290
software developer at your pace

00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,520
maintainer of open source projects and

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,030
generally active in the free and open

00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,590
source ecosystem

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:26,500
so I've been mentioning our company and

00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:29,800
we can name a couple times we are active

00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:33,040
in the financial space connecting banks

00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:37,270
with distributors essentially building a

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,190
platform where you can go to a shop and

00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,860
tell them that you want a mortgage and

00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:45,550
they will use our platform in order to

00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:47,650
compute the best offer for you now this

00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,840
sounds like a FinTech except that we are

00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:52,690
at 20 years old and well-established and

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,780
profitable it sounds extremely boring

00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:59,950
and hierarchical except that we are very

00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:02,190
h l and c goal in our management

00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,840
structure is to move decision-making

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,930
towards where they acknowledge actually

00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:11,760
is and this is where inner source really

00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:15,160
comes into play your pace itself is a

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,050
170 people company belongs to a larger

00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:20,340
holding called hippo port which it has

00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:22,390
like one and a half thousand employees

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,310
so now that you know where I'm coming

00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,290
from what I would like to learn is

00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,850
what's your company size how many people

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:32,550
here in the room are working for a

00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,550
company was like ten people startup ish

00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:40,960
okay maybe like 10 percent what about

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:44,580
hundred to three what about cooperations

00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,580
Wilson service into ten thousand people

00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:53,290
okay like ten percent how many of you

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,810
have had the feeling in the past that

00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:58,540
instead of going in circles getting

00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:01,300
priority to have your fix rolled out to

00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:04,240
the team that you depend on would have

00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:11,550
been faster achieved by doing the work

00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:11,550
yourself maybe you want quarter

00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,689
how many of you worked in engineering

00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:26,750
70% maybe what about UX 1 2 3 not set

00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:32,389
money how many product are with owners

00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:40,400
do we have in the room none one many

00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:43,220
operations people 1 2 3 4 5 6 ok how

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,110
many of you knows a feeling of wait a

00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:49,370
minute this looks broken in our

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:52,160
deployment but Jim's no longer here we

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:56,330
have no clue how to fix it does that

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,400
sound familiar to anyone lots of smiling

00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:03,410
faces people not daring to raise your

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:09,889
hand ok how many teams do we have which

00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:16,220
are fully remote how many do we have

00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:17,990
which have more than one office 1/4

00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,849
how many have at least remote

00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:28,250
individuals in your team or in your

00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:32,449
company ok so the reason why you want to

00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:35,690
look into inner sisters is if you come

00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:39,280
from background you probably have heard

00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:42,919
about putting more emphasis on

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,810
non-formal negotiations if you have a

00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:47,509
little team that's taking this to the

00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,250
extreme you may have ended up with a

00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:51,740
team that doesn't do any documentation

00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,710
as well and also as here comes two

00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:57,560
balances and recurrent roses and we will

00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:59,330
see later how that works you may also

00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,789
want to look into innocence if you want

00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:06,349
to turn customers into part of your own

00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:08,330
team helping you contributing back I've

00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:10,490
asked you before whether you have remote

00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,770
people in your companies because in

00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,139
Ursus helps you with flexibility and was

00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:18,560
becoming more remotely remote friendly

00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:21,500
of course it also helps to give more

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,759
autonomy autonomy to navigate to those

00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:29,810
working down in the trenches

00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:33,050
so at Europeans residing was a few teams

00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:36,949
setting up a tribe that's centered

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:39,710
around the topic of in Ursus after a

00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:41,990
couple after some time what became clear

00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,820
was that there are some common

00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:47,470
principles that would help us establish

00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:51,650
in Ursus in our company one of the scum

00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:54,350
one of those principles was being open

00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,850
transparent and findable essentially

00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,009
that means that you have to put all your

00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:00,320
code in a place where everyone in your

00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:02,180
company can at least read it and not

00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:06,020
only your code but also documentation

00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:07,190
etc moles that translates to put

00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:11,330
everything on github or github

00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:15,500
Enterprise and you're done right except

00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:17,930
that's not quite how it works what have

00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,330
you seen happen is you've got team a

00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,759
which has a component or micro service

00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:26,150
you've got team P which wants to reuse

00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:28,190
this micro service but kimby thinks it's

00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:31,130
not quite there yet they need another

00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:33,849
feature so what they do is to implement

00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:36,199
that feature say send a pull request

00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:38,320
progress doesn't get it get any

00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:42,260
attention

00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:44,810
this kind of fertile starts bid to be to

00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,909
bubble up towards management which then

00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:50,510
chat to each other create creating more

00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:53,110
friction lesson learned

00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:56,780
oh my gosh I know so it's doesn't work

00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:59,840
so what didn't what what what went wrong

00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,820
here one things that went wrong maybe is

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,710
the progress requests didn't get the

00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:06,110
attention because it's on the receiving

00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:09,680
end of the of the requests

00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:12,080
there was no priority on that particular

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,090
feature there was no communication

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,190
before that whether this feature was

00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,900
wanted or whether it's some things that

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,370
fits with the architecture so

00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,650
something's that's still true and that's

00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:24,110
even true an open source static

00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:27,530
conversation or a start whether there

00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:30,320
was a ticket I've made a little

00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:32,479
experiment just anecdotal evidence not

00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,550
stick statistically relevant but for the

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,940
largest open source projects it

00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:44,560
I checked roughly 50% of the

00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:47,420
sobbing rejected what else can go wrong

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,350
the teams that is making the pro request

00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,770
is working

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:55,250
lightly was slightly different Scott

00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:59,090
Stiles was slightly different standards

00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:01,430
to how a development happens so what

00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:04,100
they create some things that maybe

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:06,920
doesn't fit with a code base such they

00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,440
want to contribute to what helps was

00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:13,190
that is to sink in mi casa es su casa

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:16,820
way if you come to my house back at home

00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:19,610
I will tell you what can go wrong if you

00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,230
visit me well what is that if you go to

00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,460
my kitchen and you switch on the

00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:29,900
dishwasher and see water heating machine

00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:31,670
then the fuse will blow similar thing

00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,950
you can do in your inner source project

00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:36,320
you take a contributing document you

00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:37,910
write down your coding guidelines you

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,670
write down testing diet like guidelines

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:46,400
your how your boat pipeline works etc

00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:49,310
etc do you write all of that down it's a

00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,430
pretty long list isn't it nobody's ever

00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:55,160
gonna read it what you do write down is

00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:57,260
some things that's most essential how do

00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,120
you find what's essential it's stuff

00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:06,880
that other people have been stumbling

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:11,050
over before there we are at sea advice -

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:13,760
well you've written over verbal advice

00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:15,710
the goal here is to be able to

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,540
collaborate as asynchronous when

00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:20,060
synchronous communicate communication

00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:22,730
gets hard even for those in the audience

00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:25,940
that don't have any remote people as

00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:28,070
soon as you have team members who work

00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,560
on slightly different schedules as soon

00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,360
a few s meetings come into play it

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:37,090
starts suddenly getting more and more

00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,090
tricky to find time for pairing sessions

00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:42,170
if you go one step further if you have

00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,630
colleagues in your company which don't

00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:47,950
work on site working synchronously

00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,950
becomes even more tricky

00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:54,300
so what you want to do is to pull all

00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:57,370
your decision-making into written form

00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,920
what happened that herb Lopez was said

00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:05,470
suddenly people try to do everything in

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:07,720
writing what we learned through that us

00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:10,420
sure physical colocation is still

00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,640
beneficial you should absolutely use it

00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,920
if you go to any open source projects

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,570
they will have on-site hackathons they

00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,190
will have conferences where people meet

00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:22,720
where you learn to put faces to people

00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,850
however all of the decision making

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,620
process should still happen in a written

00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,990
form such as the team members who are

00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:33,579
not as in part of that meeting can

00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:35,260
participate at Apache our rule is that

00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:36,820
every decision has to happen on the

00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,920
mailing list and every decision has to

00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:42,190
like every important decision has to be

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:44,230
open for 72 hours do we have the same

00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,360
rule in our company clearly not we are

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,970
pretty much co-located but at least in

00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:52,630
the same time zone so depending on

00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:53,380
Europe setting you will have to figure

00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,930
that out

00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,790
so the gist really is that you want to

00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,740
take decisions where everyone can

00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:05,050
participate and remove settings that's

00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:07,449
in a written form what happens if you do

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,920
that is that you create a project memory

00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:11,949
essentially a kind of passive

00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,279
documentation what I mean mister passive

00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:17,170
documentation is not a pile of documents

00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:19,779
what I mean is something that is an

00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:23,290
archive set is searchable so it has

00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:25,089
stable URLs over time so that you can go

00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:27,010
there drill down to your conversation

00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:29,079
link it and send it to someone else and

00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:32,320
that link is still valid ten years from

00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:34,930
now if you go to your patchy you can go

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,839
to the httpd service project and drill

00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:39,699
down to 1995 and still find the

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,829
decisions and the discussions that

00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:46,839
happens there and you can still search

00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:49,750
them we do a retrospective at our pace

00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:52,029
on moving towards a more written

00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:54,190
communication form feedback that we

00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:57,550
received was full requests are more

00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:59,470
detailed feedbacks of people received

00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:03,310
seems to rock

00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:04,930
just quite solid feedback why do you

00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:07,390
want that clearly you want to remember

00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:10,600
what you did you want to remember why

00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:12,250
you did something even years from now so

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,020
some things that we have observed is

00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:17,410
something was implemented you see it's

00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:21,160
implemented now but you start wondering

00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:24,130
is that a feature or can I delete it is

00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,440
that customers still around is that use

00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:28,630
case still around and you only know that

00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:32,560
if you've trekked why you've implemented

00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:34,540
something now if you move towards a

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,200
setting where more things are being

00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:40,300
written down and archived forever what

00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:44,200
do you need to establish is a culture

00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:47,380
where mistakes are okay what I mean was

00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:50,320
a culture where mistakes are okay do you

00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:52,950
remember how back at school you were

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:59,280
sitting in the classroom writing a test

00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:59,280
teacher standing right at your back step

00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:06,280
that doesn't sound very comfortable does

00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:09,910
it but that's exactly what it feels like

00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:12,430
in the beginning if you roll out and you

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,710
want to share work in progress github

00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,630
has this nice feature of marking pull

00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,370
requests as still being in progress

00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:22,060
something's that's not supposed to be

00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:24,940
merged back um that's a nice way in

00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:26,530
order to show to share early progress to

00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:29,320
get early feedback from your

00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:32,380
collaborators and to avoid running into

00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,240
the wrong direction however you need to

00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:39,220
be comfortable and you need to have

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,960
colleagues who appreciate that what you

00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,030
will have to figure out as well as how

00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,280
much configuration you want to do is to

00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:48,390
avoid things going wrong over how much

00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:52,480
convention you want to have at a patchy

00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:55,860
we had a talk on good community

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:59,140
practices one of them was to have little

00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,780
configuration and more social strings

00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:04,600
attached

00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:07,150
so three community convention people

00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,390
know when to merge for requests people

00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:11,820
know how to do things if you have teams

00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:14,490
that are not experienced

00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,460
this kind of work you likely want to at

00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:20,580
first at least opt for more

00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:23,400
configuration like lockdown fortress

00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:25,680
being locked down per request from being

00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:30,960
merged if they haven't received a review

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:32,970
already for instance something else for

00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,970
making it okay to make mistakes is to

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:38,460
automate feedback something like style

00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,320
violations testing violation sets all

00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,930
some things that a bot can tell you

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:48,180
without overloading maintainer x' to do

00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:50,100
all of these reviews with that then you

00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:53,120
can move to your model value value

00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:55,650
contributions over feature requests

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,450
taken to the extremes this means

00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:59,970
integrating your customers into your

00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:02,400
development projects set something that

00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:04,620
we've done at our pace where our

00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:07,260
platform is being developed as an over

00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:09,230
pace but used by other subsidiaries of

00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:12,150
you purport and some of these

00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:15,060
subsidiaries decided to help us will see

00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:19,080
implementation and see refinement of the

00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:23,000
platform so essentially taking see pulls

00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:26,490
the customer in early one step further

00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,070
as soon as you receive contributions

00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:33,090
you wanna reward them typically with

00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:35,820
praise as publicly and as early as often

00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:38,010
one pattern that we have even in the

00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:40,740
inner source Commons is to praise

00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:42,570
participants and to give qualified

00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,820
thank-yous what do you mean basic

00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:47,610
qualify thank you I don't say thanks

00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:50,970
things I say thank you for X because it

00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:53,700
helped me do why this helps this makes

00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:57,240
it more credible it also helps the

00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:59,420
contributor understand which kinds of

00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,460
contributions of our common needed

00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:05,400
however you also can say thank you with

00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:09,449
influence you can pull your contributors

00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:12,300
in as new trusted commuters what the

00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:12,810
heck is extra commuter the goal of

00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,780
committee

00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:18,770
trusted committee is someone who mentors

00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:21,089
enables and invites new contributors

00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:22,709
it's someone who is responsible and

00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:24,630
accountable so setting the house rules

00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,660
remember the contributions m-day from

00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:30,630
earlier

00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:32,700
so you're someone who can help who hid

00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:36,000
themselves communicates openly and

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:38,160
transparently what's important about

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,470
this role is sets this role is filled

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,900
wollen Terry so it's the way it works in

00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:46,140
our case is the invitation is sent

00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:48,450
privately to the prison in question they

00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,500
respond privately was as they okay being

00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,780
a trusted committer

00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,820
and only then it's announced publicly

00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:58,410
and widely that they are welcomed as a

00:17:53,820 --> 00:18:01,130
new trusted committer so how do you

00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:03,360
start your innocence initiative

00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:05,640
seriously a project out there called

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,210
enosis commenced our arc we've got one

00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:12,809
friend over here I maybe you're gonna

00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:14,730
stand thank you I don't know if there's

00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:17,640
anyone else in the audience and Walsall

00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:20,130
sinners those comments not yet

00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,770
okay I know that then at least the niece

00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:25,679
is somewhere here at the github

00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:28,290
satellite so what this is is essentially

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:31,049
a group of people rolling out in a

00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:33,230
search within their organizations what

00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:35,250
they did was to collect patterns

00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:38,850
collaboration patterns that you can use

00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:41,460
in your organization located as Volvo's

00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:43,470
to videotape a Learning Path so that

00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,360
your organization can better understand

00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:48,540
how to roll out inner source and what it

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,570
actually means what they have as well as

00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:54,710
a couple of books on what a gnosis is on

00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:58,230
success stories of different companies

00:18:54,710 --> 00:19:00,600
but most importantly it's a community

00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:03,410
that is open for you to join services

00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:06,360
like teams that you can join right now

00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:09,090
the select team runs and Jeri Chatham

00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,860
House Rules what does that mean you can

00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:12,360
take all of the wisdom and almost as

00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,350
lessons learned from the innocence

00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:18,780
comments and shares emotes everyone else

00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:20,370
provided you're dropping the names of

00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:23,820
the people who share those stories with

00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:24,240
you why are you supposed to drop some

00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,059
names

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,120
well if company acts as sharing that

00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:32,070
something went wrong

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,080
say likely don't want to have say a

00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:37,850
trademark associated verses failure

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:40,880
story but as I still can learn from it

00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:43,760
in addition there's two events one one

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:49,100
and spring in Europe and one in autumn

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:51,410
in the US so how do you get started so

00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:55,490
why we start gets got started at your

00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:56,870
pace was with experiments what do you

00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:59,510
mean with experiments

00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:02,470
those are real projects but they are

00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:05,480
small said you have a business impact

00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:08,840
but they are small enough to not pull

00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,660
the entire company down with tricks a

00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,010
lesson learned from these experiments

00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:15,200
collected summon retrospectives and

00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:18,230
shared those lessons learned with the

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,660
entire company well actually we shared

00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:22,970
them with the entire world by putting

00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:27,680
them on our tech block so you yourself

00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:30,410
can read them as well we brought

00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,990
together people within the company who

00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:34,970
very into open source who were in trio

00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:37,280
inner service and who wanted to

00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:41,180
collaborate to a monthly meeting

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,100
essentially like a tribe but luckily

00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:45,380
what happened was that we had one

00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:48,410
representative of each important

00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:50,180
department in that meeting so that we

00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:53,660
could tap another knowledge of what

00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:55,970
happens in those departments so what we

00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:58,850
did was to collect these patterns to

00:20:55,970 --> 00:21:01,280
share them in the organization and to

00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:03,410
share not only what didn't work but also

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,480
the success stories and the fixes of

00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:07,160
what didn't work so that others didn't

00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:12,040
have to repeat the mistakes that we had

00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:14,300
made some feedback

00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:17,360
yeah we've been collaborating with

00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:20,180
professionals for those of you not

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:23,390
speaking German there's also a you yeah

00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:29,210
it was fun and who doesn't want to have

00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:33,320
fun at work so just summarize what you

00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:36,310
want to do is to strive to a open and

00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:38,870
transparent and findable collaboration

00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:43,220
you want to value written or verbal

00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:45,050
advice three is that with written

00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:47,600
communication you will end up at a

00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:50,550
project manner memory essentially a

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,620
passive form of documentation

00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:56,680
again this kind of documentation this is

00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:58,510
not like your entire specification of

00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,060
your software stack it's nothing formal

00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:03,600
and it's definitely not the end of the

00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:06,250
documentation story it's your baseline

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,210
what happens at Apache for instance is

00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:12,640
that a lot of cells commit conversations

00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:14,680
tend to be linked down to from the

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,530
formal documentation so you don't have

00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,930
to rewrite it yours already have it but

00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:23,050
if you imagine going back 20 years in

00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:25,720
history of like 300 projects discussing

00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:27,820
on a daily basis finding that one

00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,110
important communication chains gonna be

00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,170
like searching for a needle in the

00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:35,650
haystack so you want something more

00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:38,800
formal on top what you need is a culture

00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:41,440
where mistakes are okay and very you

00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,090
will end up with is a cultural rare

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,060
contributions of being valued over

00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:48,510
future risks such as people offering to

00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:52,120
help enabling people to help themselves

00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:55,290
and those people helping themselves you

00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:59,110
will end up in a environment where

00:22:55,290 --> 00:23:02,440
contributions are provided by praise and

00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:04,860
by influence and was that I'm happy to

00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,860
take questions

00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,180
[Applause]

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:17,090
yes

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:41,330
so how do we get people to value written

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:43,630
or verbal advice so most of the times

00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:46,730
that it seems really easy to go to

00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:47,690
people and talk to them instead of going

00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:52,160
the way around

00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:57,410
maybe you open an issue or whatever so a

00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:59,870
formula yeah so one one point that's

00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:01,340
important here retina verbal doesn't

00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:04,430
implies that you have to open an issue

00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:07,130
it could be as simple as talk to the

00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:09,440
public slack channel so that everyone

00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:11,450
else sees it as well this is one way of

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,790
lowering the barrier there are the

00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:16,100
things that we observed it says that as

00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:19,180
soon as teams are even distributed

00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:21,560
across two levels in the same building

00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:24,620
there's a communication barrier between

00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:29,720
these teams it could pretty much as well

00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:31,910
could be removed so it sometimes it even

00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:35,090
then it's easier to write on slack if

00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:38,870
you go beyond a certain team size or if

00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:41,660
you go beyond a certain company size it

00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:44,150
starts getting hard finding people

00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:45,950
around the corner and talking to them

00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:48,010
directly because they may be in the

00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,780
meeting save may be sick or on vacation

00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:54,340
so at some point it's easier to do it in

00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:57,560
a written way the other thing is that

00:24:54,340 --> 00:25:02,300
through this community tribes that we

00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:03,980
created we're living by example we were

00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:08,720
living the change that we wanted to see

00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:11,480
so people saw the advantage of it monix

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,750
was very simple example we've got these

00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:17,470
monthly meetings after each meeting it I

00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:22,970
sit down and write tiny meeting minutes

00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:25,190
not so tiny may I take this meeting

00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:28,070
minutes I post seven slacking on and on

00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:30,770
github after doing this for a couple of

00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:33,080
times this became like a role model way

00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:35,600
of running meetings which as a team's

00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,730
aspire to because what's a realizes you

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,670
can participate in that meeting without

00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:42,590
actually being zarin's

00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:44,780
like one hour there but you can skim

00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:46,130
read it and you can drill it down if

00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:49,940
there's something interesting to you

00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:52,370
okay so your advice is to establish best

00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:54,530
practices in your team and then push it

00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:56,660
out to your company or whatever okay

00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:58,549
thank you and of course the other thing

00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:00,770
is you need to understand why you want

00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:03,590
to do is that so you explain to people

00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:06,440
why you want to value written over

00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:08,420
verbal in our case what helped it was to

00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,280
do like workshops where we looked at the

00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:12,440
reasons why we want to look into users

00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,540
and one of the pain points that the team

00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,299
said was safe been developing software

00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:20,000
for years and they didn't remember why

00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:22,100
certain changes were made and that's

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,540
where they themselves understood okay

00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:27,860
some things have to be written down for

00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:30,400
us to remember them any further

00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,400
questions

00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,970
there's one in the back I think

00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:51,590
hi thank you for the song what do you

00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:55,970
find is the 20% of the work that does

00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:58,100
the most effect to put it in context

00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:03,200
I work in enterprise and everything is

00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:04,730
heavily load siloed so all of this would

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,000
be will be great to implement but it's

00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:11,090
almost impossible well what is the best

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,230
way to get the advantages let's start to

00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:17,240
get the advantages from what I've seen

00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:18,680
in our company and from what I've heard

00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,670
about success stories and other

00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:27,770
companies what you really want to do is

00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:30,680
to try to find one team that buys into

00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:34,100
this try to run an experiment that shows

00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:36,800
that this is valuable and from their

00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:39,410
scale out don't try to convert all of

00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:42,200
your company at once but like try to

00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:45,710
find one trial company like one trial

00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:48,710
team sorry for that team try to identify

00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:50,990
what their pain points were what we did

00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:53,990
at our case was not roll all of that out

00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:56,090
at once and Hadassah like from one day

00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:58,670
to the other but it was a continuous

00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:01,160
process so we were talking to the teams

00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:03,290
we were listening to their challenges

00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,970
and for each of these those challenges

00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:06,500
that they came up to me I was like hey

00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,920
wait a minute there's a solution over

00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,720
there

00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,850
it's called you have to communicate more

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,120
openly or you have to value written

00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:18,650
advice more or just recently we had the

00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:22,310
issue of wait a minute I want to drill

00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:24,830
down into github notifications after the

00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:26,450
fact like I have joined today but I

00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:29,230
wanna see the notification from

00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:31,820
yesterday well there's an easy fix

00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:35,510
direct all of those to a channel where

00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:37,790
everyone can access my done so try to

00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:40,310
take one team try to fix their

00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:42,800
challenges and then talk about how good

00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:45,340
that is to the rest of the company okay

00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,340
thank you

00:28:54,059 --> 00:29:02,639
any further questions last chance

00:28:58,049 --> 00:29:05,129
3 2 1 well that I would like to say

00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:05,940
thank you first of all to all of you

providing hints and being helpful also

00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:17,099
choose in my personal case to the Apache

00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:19,289
Software Foundation which is the basis

00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:21,269
of a lot of these lessons learned but

00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:23,820
also like to the guys representing the

00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:33,509
company can you just stand up turn
