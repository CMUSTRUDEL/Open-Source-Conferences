Title: Maintaining the maintainers: supporting open source tools - GitHub Satellite 2019
Publication date: 2019-05-29
Playlist: GitHub Satellite 2019 Connect Stage
Description: 
	Presented by Don Goodman-Wilson, Developer Advocate, EMEA, GitHub
Floor Drees, Product Marketing Manager, Microsoft
K Rain Leander, OpenStack Liaison, Red Hat
Mehdi Medjaoui, President, Les Mainteneurs

This panel will debate whether formalized support like an accelerator program for maintainers could provide motivation in the face of these challenges or if the risks of corporatism outweigh the benefits. At the center of this discussion will be the core question, “How do we help more people to work in open source independently?”

00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:14,849
[Music]

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,240
so welcome to maintaining the maintainer

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:22,199
z-- this is this is the comedy section

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:26,930
of the no no no this is very serious the

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:30,150
cup might be session was yesterday so

00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:33,059
we're here with rain leander from Red

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,590
Hat and floor Dre's from Microsoft I'm

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,660
Don Goodman Wilson I'm on the developer

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,100
relations team at github and all three

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,550
of us care very deeply about open source

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,140
from a very broad point of view and

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,300
we're all very interested in the

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,309
institutions that support open source

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,840
software and give it the space to grow

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:52,320
and so we're gonna have a conversation

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,129
today with these two about their

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,350
experiences and their opinions and their

00:00:55,129 --> 00:01:00,930
their predictions about how open source

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,180
is going to grow over the next say 10

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,619
years and the role that existing

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,710
institutions will play in that growth

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:11,100
and the need for new institutions to

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,540
sustain that growth so rain why don't

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,890
you say just a little bit about yourself

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,619
and how you got into open source just

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,689
quickly but I want to add to that and

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,939
that is that even though we're gonna

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,040
have a conversation between the three of

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:27,720
us today and we would really appreciate

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:31,049
your feedback after and especially if

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,869
you want to write response to things

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:37,470
that we say or add to the things that we

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:39,450
say that's that's more that is the most

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,220
important thing for me that's true we're

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,189
not just up here lecturing or under

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,020
starting a conversation yeah yeah we

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,729
would we would like to start a

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:53,939
conversation Oh

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:54,869
so I'm ring with read that and you may

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,689
have heard of us

00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:00,859
I'm a

00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:05,929
cloud community liaison with OpenStack

00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:10,099
and so the the project is massive

00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:13,430
umbrella and I am officially in the

00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:16,069
midstream project called are do between

00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:18,560
OpenStack and the Red Hat products but

00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:21,890
because the midstream product is

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,849
affected by both upstream as well as

00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:28,910
product and customers and partners I

00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:34,040
have to listen both ways all the all the

00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:36,860
time so my name is flora I work with

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:40,060
Microsoft since three months - it's

00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:43,010
quite neil still for me I come from

00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,930
open-source and startups I used to live

00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,549
in Austria for eight years and I've

00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,819
lived in Berlin actually for a year

00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:52,819
working for a startup that build on top

00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:56,150
of the pivotal Cloud Foundry platform

00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:58,780
and yeah now I'm a developer product

00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:01,430
marketing manager for Microsoft Azure

00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:04,069
and it's a whole new team in Western

00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:06,620
Europe and and I have very smart

00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:08,480
colleagues that I love working with my

00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,709
first steps in open-source because I

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,930
think that was part of the question

00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:18,650
right is when I started learning to code

00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,660
myself nine months nine months nine nine

00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:23,750
years ago and I went through the rails

00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:26,930
girls guides because like I was in a

00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:28,819
company back then that was very very

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,940
much building on top of Ruby and Ruby on

00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:33,680
Rails and just that all of the material

00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,470
was open-source and I could just go in

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,349
there and like follow it on my by my own

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:42,049
pace and then started organizing rails

00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:44,599
girls workshops and Eddings with the

00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:46,400
heading to the guides and those were

00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,470
sort of my first steps and they were so

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,190
positive the experience was so positive

00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:55,310
that I never left again I forgot to say

00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,950
my first steps in open-source yeah I'm

00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:00,349
[Music]

00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:04,160
officially a friend so in my own my

00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:05,640
undergrad is in dance and my master's is

00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,430
an IT

00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,530
and while I was giving my undergrad in

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,520
dance very close friend of mine was

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:17,190
getting his computer science degree and

00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:19,590
he said hey this really exciting company

00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,329
just started it's called Red Hat and it

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:27,150
does open-source and I was like that's

00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:29,160
nice and that it was literally a 10

00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:32,790
minute conversation and then a few years

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,370
later I was I was suit to the same

00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:37,500
friend hey I'd like to earn a little

00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,190
extra cash can I work in the computer

00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,460
labs

00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:45,720
I am technical and he goes oh yeah

00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:48,480
and so I used to do Windows support that

00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,690
was mostly turn it off and turn it back

00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:55,890
on again and then randomly go work in

00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:58,230
the Linux labs and then and they own to

00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:03,930
be moving apart a lot more yes I think

00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:10,890
we're like reverberating let's do close

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:13,020
to anyway okay and and oh so my my

00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:15,090
partner went to Duke University which is

00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:21,300
in Durham North Carolina and when we

00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:26,550
moved there I kind of went ooh I have no

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,710
idea what those symbols me what a little

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:32,040
louder

00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:33,600
okay basically we moved to North

00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,370
Carolina I kind of checked the

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,650
requirements and they always included

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,410
Linux and then one year when I happened

00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:43,050
to be looking for a job and they removed

00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:45,060
the Linux requirement I applied because

00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:47,580
I had Windows support and technical

00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,220
support and no open source support

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:55,050
whatsoever and they were like yeah we'll

00:05:50,220 --> 00:06:00,410
try and I inhaled it within 30 days I

00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:06,120
had my C II and then 10 years later oh

00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:08,130
yeah here we are so looking forward to

00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,750
the next ten years and what do you see

00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:17,780
is the biggest barrier won't reduce

00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:17,780
yourself first steps an open source I

00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:23,530
consuming oven source and Slackware

00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:26,110
point nine something which was

00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:29,880
distributed on 170 floppy disks and took

00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:32,470
all night to install good times

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,810
most of my open source involvement is in

00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:36,640
model railroading

00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,960
yeah yeah I like toy trains they're a

00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,610
lot of fun there's a lot of very

00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,050
interesting engineering challenges there

00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,420
and there's a very dedicated group of

00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,770
people working to overcome these

00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,530
challenges and they're using the open

00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,930
source development model and super fun

00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:53,290
it's you know crazy weird networking

00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:57,070
protocols and stuff like that

00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:59,290
micro miniature electronics and so I did

00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:02,440
did that for a while and then then I got

00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:05,740
a real job because it wasn't paying the

00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:09,250
bills because you know I mean look

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,990
there's six of us we're very passionate

00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:16,380
they're gonna kill me if they see this

00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:19,300
yeah but yeah so now then I ended up

00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:22,680
doing a philosophy degree and now I'm

00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:25,780
really interested in broader questions

00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,970
of the foundations of open-source what

00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,650
makes the movement successful you know

00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:31,110
what does that movement need to thrive

00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:34,600
and grow

00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:36,880
hence my next question which is which is

00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,800
over the next ten years what do you see

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:44,830
is the biggest barriers to the growth of

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:47,410
open-source and I'm how they're both

00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:50,170
looking at me like wait up in surprise

00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,250
excellent good well I think it's super

00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,710
interesting at least that there's

00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,680
there's new stakeholders right in the

00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,400
ecosystem and they're they're more

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,090
visible than they have ever been before

00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,320
I think it was the October's where we

00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:05,200
saw that Microsoft is actually the

00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,270
biggest contributor to open source and I

00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,130
know that five years ago if anyone would

00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:14,290
have told me that today I'd be working

00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:16,930
at Microsoft or like No

00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:19,090
yeah Here I am and it's it's really an

00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,970
integral part to what Microsoft does and

00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:24,640
stands for it and so and they've also

00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,759
been playing a huge part in open source

00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:30,300
and I think

00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,860
I mean we could do better and there's a

00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,440
lot of institutions that could be doing

00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,490
better but they just need to learn how

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,050
and I think that's what we want to be

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:42,120
talking about I so I feel like the

00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:45,990
biggest blocker over the next ten years

00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:48,060
is going to be not adapting to change

00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,120
and trying to do what you've always done

00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:54,810
because you've always done it and so

00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:57,060
evolving is is key and then also

00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:00,420
listening actually listening to the

00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:03,389
community and then third burnout burnout

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:07,589
is a blocker so like we're still

00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:09,899
passionate but that could change if

00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:12,500
we're working full time if we're if

00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:15,899
we're doing our day job but then also

00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,820
and then also at night coding and

00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:19,740
contributing and doing that and I I

00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,449
realized that there are a lot of people

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,269
out there who are not open-source

00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:26,279
contributors for their day jobs but they

00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:30,000
feel passionate and so they have this

00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:32,850
nine-to-five 40 hours a week or more or

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,370
less and then they also contribute after

00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:41,339
work and and actually when the when the

00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:46,560
github supports was announced my initial

00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:49,079
reaction was that was awesome like the

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,569
idea of that is awesome but also in the

00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:52,740
back of my head because it's something

00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:56,550
on my mind

00:09:52,740 --> 00:10:00,209
burnout is I think okay yeah but doesn't

00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:02,970
that also encourage less of a work-life

00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:04,589
balance for people because you feel like

00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:08,370
you have a responsibility to the people

00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:10,680
that are begging you yeah like like yeah

00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:13,139
I immediately was like we what about

00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:16,529
balance what about mental health

00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:24,029
what about burnout so that that's on my

00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:26,760
mind but you can tell where I am no I I

00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:29,100
think it's you know so yeah I understand

00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,940
where you're coming from at least this a

00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:34,410
way where people can work on open source

00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:36,660
full-time they have the opportunity to

00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,490
maybe be able to work full time on open

00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,690
source so that's first to say the

00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:44,610
ability I think it good

00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:46,950
thing open-source project

00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,630
so companies could support the open

00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,760
source projects that they depend upon

00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:53,400
rice and just give back to the community

00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,840
in a different way than sort of gobbling

00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,090
up some of these open source companies

00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,740
that they've been doing which is not the

00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,780
best solution because it's usually they

00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,820
they then end up in this whole corporate

00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,990
machine where the corporate machine

00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,060
should actually be working for them

00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,980
right because there's corporate cesare

00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:11,610
very good at a couple of things like HR

00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:13,980
and marketing and PR they should be

00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:15,780
worth working with these projects and

00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,930
helping them with all of these abilities

00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,240
that they have and not have them become

00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:24,840
a cog in the machine

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:28,170
yeah I also feel like I mean who as a

00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:30,390
child dreams become a open-source

00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,910
maintainer you know no one it's

00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,020
something that happens to you and if you

00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,460
need all the help that you can get

00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,160
because you don't have all of the skill

00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:43,140
sets that are needed for a software

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:44,970
project to thrive yeah yeah I think

00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,220
that's very interesting actually so so

00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,930
do you see then an increase in the rate

00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,380
of burnout and an increase in the risk

00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:54,990
of burnout in the project absolutely I

00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:59,100
have been the OpenStack community

00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:01,590
liaison for only two years before that I

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:04,980
was a full-time Python engineer within

00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:09,870
the same project and in the last single

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:12,720
year there have been a rather large

00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:15,690
number of engineers either switch

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:20,790
projects within the company or leave the

00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:26,790
company completely in in different ways

00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:31,050
and that's that's you know that's it's

00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:35,580
not good I mean Red Hat does very good I

00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:39,810
I have been sick before and Red Hat has

00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:41,850
supported my recovery and whatnot but it

00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:44,460
really depends on who your manager is

00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:46,000
and what department and and and what

00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,920
country you live in

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,430
[Music]

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:55,150
yeah yeah I have and you know one person

00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:58,100
burning out from something that's that

00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:59,630
could be just some it could be the

00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,610
project could be something else could be

00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,170
the manager could be like any number of

00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,840
factors but then you have two people

00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:08,450
burn out within the same project within

00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,070
a very short span that's coincidence and

00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,950
then three people that becomes a pattern

00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:18,410
and that's that means something needs to

00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:19,730
change so historically this whole time

00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,140
but there's a little bit of roundabout

00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:23,030
here historically there been two very

00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,380
large institutions right that supported

00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:26,210
open source software the Free Software

00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,280
Foundation and the open source

00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:32,650
initiative right and they both had goals

00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:35,660
around legitimizing open source as a

00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:37,040
bonafide development model right and

00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:41,180
creating corporate acceptance especially

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,860
in the oocytes case of open source what

00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,950
kinds of institutions are we missing

00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,480
that could help help address this

00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,630
problem that you raised of increasing

00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,250
rates of burnout an increasing sense of

00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:55,040
not having enough time or opportunity to

00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:58,430
continue maintaining the software that

00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:02,780
you do or resources could be resources

00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:04,940
could be corporate corporate structures

00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:11,540
and you'd be you know systemic

00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:15,650
incentives right now it is there a

00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:18,160
couple of topics that are hotter to a

00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:20,660
lot of people and one is diversity and

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,690
the other is work-life balance and

00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:27,380
preventing burnout I I feel I've noticed

00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:30,670
in the past three years or so

00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:33,170
and I feel like that is great like that

00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:36,650
acknowledgment that there is a need for

00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:40,610
diversity there is a need for a focus on

00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:44,060
yourself right not just on the code that

00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:46,640
company the project and and so that's

00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:47,900
already started happening but there's

00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:52,790
not

00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:54,230
a institution that is officially being

00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:56,900
like you know what I'm going to focus

00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:59,930
there there are little institutions that

00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:02,420
focus on mental health or data for

00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:05,570
specific diversity demographic or

00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:08,540
whatnot but there's not one that's like

00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:13,880
the equivalent of OSI there's no come

00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:16,340
single company that's like shouting I'm

00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,560
going to do this which is baby

00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,390
maybe not Bessie yeah maybe it's a good

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,770
thing that it's a bit scattered yeah

00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:23,900
that you have real school Summer of Code

00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:26,570
that helps provide scholarships for

00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,700
women to work on open source projects

00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:31,040
and that you have I know CN CF that

00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,140
helps community organizers to organize

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,940
their conferences I mean maybe it's a

00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:39,470
good thing that it support is like

00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:45,890
grassroots thank you spread out I was

00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:52,880
looking for that work yeah like frankly

00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:56,470
I think that the community is key like

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,940
if the community is silent then

00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:02,060
institutions and companies and projects

00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:06,980
can do whatever they want but if the

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:09,590
community demands XYZ or says this is

00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:12,620
what's important to me as an individual

00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:15,440
and slope floor comes along and it's

00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,300
like that's important to me too and you

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,680
come along and you say that's important

00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:25,970
to meet you then we've developed a voice

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:28,970
together and to me it's not about the

00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:31,660
institutions like yay yay for making

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:34,850
open-source relevance yay red hat sure

00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:41,810
but I'm more interested in encouraging

00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:44,090
the people from my own part I think

00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:47,000
institutions can be can be formal they

00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:49,730
can be informal right and so I think

00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,710
community is a form of institution right

00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:53,420
it's just not it it's not a formalized

00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,920
version of it so that's I mean for me

00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,520
that you know that that's very very

00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:02,529
interesting to hear

00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:04,329
as of as a community of practice you

00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:07,179
know those of us who are maintaining

00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:09,040
open source we we do open source right

00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:10,750
and at one point in time that had very

00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,510
very specific meaning right that was

00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:16,120
tied to a political ideology it was tied

00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:18,339
to a legal framework for creating

00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:21,429
licenses that ensured that certain

00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:22,870
conditions were met over the over the

00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:25,329
past ten years and looking forward to

00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:27,040
the next two years how has the practical

00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:29,020
definition of open source as we as

00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:33,550
practitioners use it how is how has that

00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:34,929
changed like I can think of this I can

00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:37,230
think of some examples of my own but I'd

00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:40,450
really like to hear it from from you

00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:44,340
you're a panel member now we're just the

00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,340
three of us not four of us so go for it

00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:54,360
okay so for example there are a number

00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:57,040
of open source projects maintained by

00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:00,040
larger corporations that are you know

00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:08,050
mainly used for recruiting right it's

00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:10,330
got sample meaningful looks anything

00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:11,679
DevOps related no not anything that pops

00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,600
really would you see a lot of them right

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,309
you you go I don't want to name names

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,750
and I don't think it's a bad thing

00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:18,240
either right like this but it's a very

00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:23,020
different purpose right it's not about

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:25,000
freeing software and and the freedom to

00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,290
do is you want with the software now now

00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,429
it's like it's a marketing tool right

00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:30,670
it's something that lots of people can

00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:32,650
participate in and in virtue of that you

00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:34,240
can identify community leaders and and

00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:36,190
and then recruit them right so that's

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,059
one way that I think it's evolved no

00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:42,100
judgment on whether that's good or bad

00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:44,200
another way that it's evolved is that

00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,450
for example some projects and again I'm

00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:50,020
not going to name names I don't want to

00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:53,679
do that I don't want to judge offer

00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:54,670
their software as open source but

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,170
they're not looking for active

00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,730
contributors right they're putting it

00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,740
out there because they want to meet a

00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:02,440
certain legal requirement or they have a

00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:05,890
certain set of legal goals associated

00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:08,080
with having the source open right as as

00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,830
a tool to prevent certain things from

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,090
happening

00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,380
but there it's not open source because

00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,570
they want other people contributing to

00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:18,970
it so they're using the legal framework

00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:21,640
for four different ins yeah but you know

00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:23,830
as so as as practitioners of open source

00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:38,170
for example how important is license

00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:43,890
choice to you well I like yeah some open

00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:47,470
source comm kind of took the essence of

00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:50,230
open source and defined it a little bit

00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:53,470
more specifically that it has to be

00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:55,690
dynamic receive feedback in kind of the

00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:57,370
prototype model that it that it needs to

00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:01,210
be public that there needs to be

00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:05,980
maintained Erzebet don't quote me a good

00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:09,280
thing this isn't recording and and that

00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:13,510
opened it up to be about government or

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:16,900
cities or or healthcare or so many other

00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:20,530
things than software and part of that

00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:26,070
key between proprietary and open source

00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:30,370
is the license but frankly the life

00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:32,560
licenses don't cover every use case

00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:35,940
every possible use case in the world

00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:39,810
there is we were talking last night and

00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:43,630
and we brought up what about when

00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:45,730
someone wants to put their projects

00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:47,800
online have it be open source get other

00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:50,140
contributors you know like to take all

00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:54,310
the boxes except they're worried about

00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:59,560
inventing dynamite that is then taken

00:20:54,310 --> 00:21:03,610
and used to kill people and and why

00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:08,710
isn't there a license for that specific

00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:14,320
use case like that's that's only one

00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:16,120
example and and frankly I don't know why

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,180
there's not a license for that probably

00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:21,200
because if that code is out there then

00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:23,420
the code is out there it's

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:27,020
still out there and that's a that's

00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:28,550
still a risk like you you like why do

00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,860
people jump out of perfectly good

00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:32,720
airplanes because of the adrenaline rush

00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:40,580
there's there's things are still gonna

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:42,830
happen I think I think that's a very

00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:45,500
good point right and a very strict

00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:47,120
reading like putting those sorts of

00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:50,300
restrictions on software is no longer

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,580
open source right nevertheless I think

00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:55,220
there there is a sense of growing since

00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,900
among certain segments that there are

00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,060
ethical concerns that there is a

00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,860
different set of moral assumptions that

00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,720
underlying why they're creating this and

00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:05,030
it's not about the freedom to do it the

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,470
disease like but something else and I

00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:08,120
can't quite put my finger on what it is

00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,280
but it's about this about sharing it's

00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,200
about community building it's about but

00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,690
it's also about doing good in the world

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,180
right not just releasing things

00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:18,860
willy-nilly but thinking carefully and

00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,270
conscientiously about what the code gets

00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:23,720
used for and there's there's there's a

00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:27,470
tension there I think that is is not

00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,790
currently addressed by the existing

00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,990
institutions that we have because

00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:33,410
they're focused on a different set of

00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,480
philosophical principles alright just

00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:38,330
y-you know you know the next question

00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,610
right like to the extent that

00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:43,700
open-source is changing like should we

00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:48,050
be looking to support these new ways of

00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:50,810
doing things and formalizing these kinds

00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:53,240
of practices the way that free software

00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:55,400
and an open-source and the strict OS ice

00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,590
incident have been formalized right to

00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:02,660
support and legitimizes those use cases

00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:05,300
I not necessarily from a license point

00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:07,550
of view but just generally yeah I think

00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,410
there's also still a lot of third

00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:11,210
there's a huge awareness campaign still

00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:14,450
to happen I think one of the sessions in

00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:18,140
the learn Trek upstairs was about the

00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:19,370
open source program office enterprises

00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:22,820
because still within an enterprise

00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:24,530
there's even if Microsoft adopts open

00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,940
source it's not like the whole

00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:29,210
organization understand what that even

00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:31,470
means and those are programs that's that

00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:35,460
are very important still

00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:37,529
to have a look at and I think I think

00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:44,389
it's important to understand yourself

00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:48,509
where is your line where is what

00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:51,240
Red Hat might call me more naked than

00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:55,080
transparent because my line is a little

00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:58,470
bit more transparent than Red Hat as a

00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:01,230
company can afford to be but that's my

00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:04,139
line and I know where my line is and so

00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:06,120
I am willing to do X Y C and if

00:24:04,139 --> 00:24:08,279
something comes along that is grey I

00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:14,820
have to examine that and see if it's

00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:18,899
within my line and institutions have to

00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:21,299
do that too and if they have a room for

00:24:18,899 --> 00:24:28,529
that yeah and but I also feel like open

00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:32,399
sources become too broad like it means

00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:35,159
many things to many people yes yeah do

00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:36,870
we need new terms yeah what does a post

00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:38,750
open source world look like or better

00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:43,620
yet what do we call it there are zombies

00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:45,299
no not post-apocalyptic oh oh sorry

00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:47,879
those are just the projects that have

00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:51,330
been abandoned open source is not the

00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:53,220
apocalypse I don't know actually I've

00:24:51,330 --> 00:25:01,230
been I've been searching for terms but I

00:24:53,220 --> 00:25:04,830
thought that's yeah so so we've talked

00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:06,980
about we've talked about briefly like

00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:09,090
creating ethical frameworks for people

00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,919
who are concerned about the ethical

00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:14,399
consequences of their software right

00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:18,090
we've talked a bit about the way that

00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:18,720
open source is used for marketing

00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:22,129
purposes

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:25,129
right or or strictly legal purposes

00:25:22,129 --> 00:25:27,600
we've even talked a little bit about

00:25:25,129 --> 00:25:29,009
diversity and inclusion and open source

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,389
communities I'd like to circle back

00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:34,830
around to that for just a moment

00:25:30,389 --> 00:25:36,750
right because I think sustaining the

00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:38,610
growth of open source requires bringing

00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,930
more people in right we have to bring

00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,810
more

00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:44,510
people in and the only way that we're

00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:51,080
going to get more people in is we move

00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:53,810
beyond white dudes white dude yeah I

00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,940
want less of me more more more not me

00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:58,100
right can we do that you mentioned

00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:01,580
grassroots campaigns is a way of doing

00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:03,830
that but I mean what other options do we

00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:06,350
have like how can we how can we create a

00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:13,460
culture where that's the norm well right

00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:17,330
now I really like the in the what is

00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:20,290
like the Google protests and and people

00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:23,690
welcome yeah the walk out people are

00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:25,970
complaining loudly and publicly and

00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:30,890
that's that's awesome

00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:33,890
yes more yes and that's something that

00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:36,560
we do as individuals but also having an

00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:39,370
institution publicly step forward and be

00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:42,110
like you know what anyone that wants to

00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:44,110
anonymously step forward we will protect

00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:47,930
you and we'll get your story out there

00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:50,210
that would be nice too but it's not it's

00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:55,250
not just because it seems like there's a

00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:59,360
focus maybe just on skin color or sex

00:26:55,250 --> 00:27:04,580
right now and it's not just gender and

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:10,670
race its age and cultural backgrounds

00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:14,570
and ability and economic and so so much

00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:19,190
of diversity and frankly I've picked a

00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:23,950
couple that I fight for and then I get

00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:25,250
behind other people who fight for things

00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,990
yeah

00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:30,230
that's why that's why the pronoun

00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:32,600
sticker by the way I always have the

00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:35,890
alternative pronoun stickers is because

00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:42,880
that's my fight that's what I fight for

00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:44,470
is non-binary recognition this is great

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,480
this is like how do we normalize this

00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:49,540
sort of attitude or non Snickers that's

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:52,650
a good one we talked about the other

00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:58,990
thing I fight for is mental mence a

00:27:52,650 --> 00:28:01,230
distinct nation D stigmatization English

00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:05,590
is hard

00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:11,200
D stigmatization have you seen that new

00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:13,540
Dutch days at sea yeah to be honest I

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,470
don't know - making mental illness more

00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,950
normal

00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:18,580
normalizing normalizing that's a good

00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:22,150
one

00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:22,840
mental illness and so I talk about it on

00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:25,450
my blog

00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:28,690
I will talk about my mental illnesses I

00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:31,770
have PTSD and depression and I take

00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:34,570
medication for it and I think it likes

00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:37,510
five years ago the audience would have

00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:41,890
been like and maybe maybe inside you

00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:45,070
feel like that right now but I think

00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:49,180
like someone in this audience just heard

00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:52,260
that and went oh okay cool and like

00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:55,180
feels better and that's important like

00:28:52,260 --> 00:29:00,100
that's how that's how I fight that is an

00:28:55,180 --> 00:29:02,650
individual sight but what about you know

00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:05,500
whatever I also things like part of

00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:07,240
bigger bigger bigger corporations and so

00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,160
I am brain saying open source of trying

00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,960
to empower open source is that they have

00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,460
pilots policies for these type of things

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,950
and they have processes for that these

00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,780
type of things and that's that's one of

00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:19,330
the really good examples of what they

00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:24,120
can introduce to open source to make it

00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:25,510
a bit more inclusive and diverse yeah

00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,930
cool

00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:30,250
so last question then is I want to talk

00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,770
a little bit about maintaining a rowdy

00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:34,270
ah

00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:36,970
simply because what is that what is that

00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:39,340
tell us maintain rowdy is an

00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:42,070
organization for maintaining maintainer

00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:43,450
x' for creating a forum for discussion

00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,430
of the issues and problems that

00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,540
maintainer his face and working to

00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,470
dissolve them together

00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,990
it's a

00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:51,960
conference that's met three times I

00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:54,100
think another meeting is tomorrow

00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,509
there'll be more over the course of the

00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,399
year we're going to find out tomorrow

00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:59,889
really what what develop or what

00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:04,000
maintain errs problems maintain restore

00:29:59,889 --> 00:30:07,960
amazing Joe thanks this going this is my

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,139
favorite people in the audience also

00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:13,090
it's sold out so sorry if you didn't

00:30:11,139 --> 00:30:16,480
raise your hand it'll it'll come back

00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:20,740
around but what would your advice be to

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,600
maintain arathi like moving forward what

00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:25,419
would you recommend that we do that we

00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:31,389
focus on to be most effective you have

00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:34,480
an opinion floor what so I mean Don you

00:30:31,389 --> 00:30:37,269
have supported me in the organizing the

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,980
Ross Kampf conferences which are Ruby

00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:41,879
open source software conferences where

00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:44,289
most of the time of the day is actually

00:30:41,879 --> 00:30:46,870
solely dedicated to finding new

00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:50,500
long-term contributors for open source

00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:52,629
projects which is super beneficial for

00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,309
everyone for what everyone attending and

00:30:52,629 --> 00:30:56,710
we did interviews with all of the

00:30:54,309 --> 00:30:59,710
maintainer and the thing that they

00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:00,970
struggled with most Lauren like most of

00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:03,519
their challenges have all to do with

00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:05,350
people management and how do you respond

00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,750
to issues that need to respond to issues

00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:09,789
like how much time can I take until I

00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:11,730
respond to an issue and why is everyone

00:31:09,789 --> 00:31:15,129
looking at me to respond to like

00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:16,990
shitstorm happening in the community and

00:31:15,129 --> 00:31:19,539
so that's something that maintainer is

00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:21,460
apparently vanilla what alright that's a

00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:24,700
cry for help if you ask me and so that

00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:28,570
will be a topic that should be addressed

00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:32,860
much more than it is now and I think

00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:37,210
that if maintain around he wants to gain

00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:40,179
momentum it needs to be documented more

00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:41,620
and then because I know I as part of

00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:44,889
maintain irani there is someone that

00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:50,019
takes notes and and then those notes are

00:31:44,889 --> 00:31:52,990
gathered and then they disappear in the

00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:55,929
past historically unfortunately okay yes

00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:58,509
so now we have an anthropologist exactly

00:31:55,929 --> 00:31:59,910
there's a person who a single person

00:31:58,509 --> 00:32:03,150
which is

00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:05,010
a single point of failure who will take

00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:07,010
notes and then get them online and

00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:09,270
published and there needs to be more

00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:12,630
writers beautifully

00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:14,910
we have tuned for tomorrow ok great and

00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:18,330
then anthropologist to process meant

00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:21,720
Elisaveta exactly and so so me

00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:23,220
documentation sauce so much this is

00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,790
seriously not a leading question we

00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:30,570
actually hadn't discussed advice taken

00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:35,430
time machine used I've altered the

00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:37,380
pastor great I mean you talk to a lot of

00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:39,810
maintainer Zsasz will raise at the last

00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:42,060
year is Daru Co conference it's also a

00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:44,340
ruby conference sorry for like going on

00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,510
about Ruby all the time you you

00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,100
interviewed a couple of maintained errs

00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,880
as well did you also ask them about

00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,580
their challenges

00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,930
I bet to you you do for me that was the

00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,670
very beginning of this project and I

00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:55,320
hadn't really started thinking about the

00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:56,790
challenges so much is just like well

00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,770
what if we just had a platform for

00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:59,820
people to sort of get on a soapbox and

00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:02,190
talk about whatever's on their mind

00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,720
which is frequently like hey my project

00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:05,610
is awesome and nobody's heard of it and

00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,290
it sort of transformed into hey my

00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:10,530
project is also me nobody's heard of it

00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:13,670
and I need help and and then white start

00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:15,690
to go on like oh I see I see and

00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:16,650
well-spoken smore on the problems that

00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:18,450
you're having and talk about that

00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:23,070
because I mean people love to complain I

00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:24,600
love to complain so from those initial

00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:26,520
interviews I didn't get I didn't get

00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,990
much but it did sort of orient me in the

00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,730
direction of asking these sorts of

00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:32,010
questions what what is your biggest pain

00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:33,960
point I mean money frankly is the

00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:36,450
response that comes back so I'm very

00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,520
happy to see sponsors I think it's not

00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:40,620
just the availability of money but the

00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:45,150
availability of you know viable business

00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:47,400
models and I think one possible function

00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:49,590
is the creation of like a business model

00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,450
advisory group I don't know like like

00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:54,030
those you oh so this is what your

00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:55,530
project looks like here's here's a range

00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:57,060
of viable business models that have

00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:58,010
worked in the past that you can try out

00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,900
for your own if you

00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:01,490
want to monetize it it's a thought I

00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:06,800
don't know if that's what people want or

00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:10,940
not but an open office like not not a

00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:15,770
physical open office that layout is

00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:18,169
 a open office hours an office

00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:23,030
hours officers kind of thing where

00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:27,500
people can talk to a coach mentorship

00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:31,570
yeah just like I would like to Marquette

00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:34,100
my I don't know what license to choose I

00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:35,389
would like more people that come to my

00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:38,960
Meetup

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:47,929
