As we strive to make progress on looming social issues like class divides, climate change, and access to education, innovation is key. New technologies are one of the most effective ways we can manage the complexity of these problems—bringing together institutions, developers, and companies to build collaborative open source solutions—and many of them are being built on GitHub.

In this session you’ll hear from people who are working at the intersection of social change and open source technology and walk away inspired by their stories of impact on some of the most important issues of our time.
