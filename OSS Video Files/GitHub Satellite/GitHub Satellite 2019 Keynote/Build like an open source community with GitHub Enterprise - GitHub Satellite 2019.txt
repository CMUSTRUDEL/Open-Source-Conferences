00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,340
now we want to share how our

00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:20,950
interconnected community actually

00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,710
extends into enterprises and large

00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:25,570
organizations and helps them be part of

00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,789
the community too and to tell you about

00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,200
that I'm super excited to have Dana

00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:31,250
Lawson vice president of engineering

00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:37,880
join us Dana

00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:37,880
[Applause]

00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:45,660
danke Shon ku I've been waiting to say

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,520
that for a long time how do y'all what a

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,260
privilege it is to be here today in

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,390
beautiful Berlin and I don't know about

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,129
you but this face is just absolutely

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,410
mind-blowing I've never been at a

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:58,140
conference like this so as you've heard

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,330
from NAT shanku and gray that the world

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,360
of open-source is truly an

00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:05,610
interconnected community not only does

00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,130
it take a global team to create your

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,380
favorite open-source technologies the

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,900
same is true for enterprise products and

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:17,610
companies that we've come to know love

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:20,040
and trust did you know that enterprise

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,890
companies are the largest contributors

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,590
and consumers of open-source and we are

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,259
so proud to play a part in the products

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,479
that these software companies make with

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,090
over 2 million organizations trusting

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,670
github as well as over half of the

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,530
Fortune 50 companies use github

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,860
enterprise for their internal

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,500
development I love that these companies

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,759
are sharing their code and ideas but the

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,619
downside for these large-scale

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,880
organizations that it's just still too

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,580
difficult to understand how they're

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,649
using open-source how secure they are in

00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:55,229
addition to what packages and products

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:57,390
are bringing into their ecosystems but

00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,990
more importantly how their broader teams

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:03,330
are innovating and collaborating here at

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:06,149
github we listened and I am so pleased

00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,310
to announce available today these four

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,950
new enterprise features that will help

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,450
not only me as an engineering leader but

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,660
countless other companies as they

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:19,349
continue to innovate and they our

00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:22,080
enterprise accounts internal repos new

00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:24,650
roles and permissions in organization

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,650
insights

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,270
so let's dive in last October we

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,790
introduced a limited beta for enterprise

00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:38,130
account feature with air price accounts

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:41,220
you can group all the organizations in a

00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:43,260
single account making it easier for you

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,890
to manage the needs of every org and

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:49,020
team in your company but just with

00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,459
enterprise accounts we also wanted to

00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,500
make it easier for companies to share

00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:55,500
their code across the organization in a

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,110
safe open and secure way before you only

00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,959
had two choices private and public repos

00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:03,750
and today we're introducing internal

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,880
repos I'm sure you're like what our

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,760
internal repos they don't make no sense

00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:11,640
we already a private repos I know right

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,410
but internal repos are away for an

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,120
helping Enterprise company state

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:17,280
interconnected because software

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,610
development is truly a team sport

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:24,180
it takes designers tech support cells

00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:25,830
even bosses like me and others in an

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,120
organization to build these products we

00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,860
love because it's not just about

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,680
developing code it's about everything

00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,989
that we do to make it wonderful so now

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,820
with enterprise in eternal repose you

00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:37,890
can broadly share your projects where

00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,820
every user in an enterprise account can

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,250
participate

00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,350
no more trudging through going hey can I

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,299
get access to that can I get access to

00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:49,049
that now you have access to that so

00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:52,440
you're welcome so we created Enterprise

00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:54,090
accounts yeah it's a big deal yeah so we

00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,220
created enterprise accounts to easily

00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,410
manner your org and internal repos to

00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,670
inter source your projects but we also

00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,989
wanted to help maintain errs because

00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,359
it's not all about enterprise it's

00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:05,040
really about y'all and enterprise of the

00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:07,410
like have the ability to give the right

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,940
access at the right time because like I

00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,250
said it's not just about writing code

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,500
it's about everything else that happens

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,180
and it's just equally as important our

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,650
goal is to enable everyone to contribute

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,750
no matter if you're new to open source

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:22,109
or you're an enterprise company with

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,970
nuance needs so we've worked to overhaul

00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:25,950
our permission model to introduce new

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:29,130
roles for your team the triage and

00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:30,960
maintain role the triage role allows

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,910
users the ability to manage issues

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,650
without having to Rabb write access to

00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,580
your code so I know you maintainer

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,349
they're gonna feel pretty good about

00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,020
that when those noobs getting your repos

00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:42,090
and you're like I don't know you but I

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:45,870
love you but you can't write

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:48,060
so you're welcome the maintained role

00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:50,160
which has most of the rights of admins

00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:53,130
but removes the ability to do dangerous

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,110
thing like delete repos because believe

00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:57,150
me you don't want to do that not that I

00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,169
have but maybe I okay I have but

00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,540
whatever you don't wanna be that person

00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:02,660
don't be me that's that's why I don't

00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:05,070
yeah anyway

00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,630
now that we have all these tools to

00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:10,080
better enable your enterprise teams to

00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:11,550
ship smarter faster and more secure we

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,690
also wanted to give them the ability to

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,750
understand how they're using their

00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:17,639
development work flows with organization

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,990
insights you can now understand where

00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,970
your teams are spending time in these

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,919
workflows what languages you're using

00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,050
and what's changing over time in your

00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:27,660
company's ecosystem and this is just the

00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,639
beginning with org insights our goal is

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,750
to be the instrument panel for your

00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:35,700
development lifecycle now listen I am

00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,760
sure you're as excited as I am about

00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:41,010
these features and we are bringing to

00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,680
developers maintainer and enterprise

00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:45,720
companies alike and I am also sure you

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,910
never thought enterprise could be so

00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,210
cool because believe me it is I mean

00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:54,240
look at this but most importantly more

00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:56,130
most importantly valuable because it

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,200
really does take a global team to build

00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,940
these global products and we really want

00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,680
to enable everybody no matter where you

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,080
come from no matter where you work no

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,090
matter what you do but don't just take

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,430
my word for it here to tell their story

00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,410
how Enterprise company Shopify has

00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,539
embraced open-source and enabled their

00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:15,980
culture with the mantra open by default

00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:22,029
our sebastian and christian

00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:22,029
[Applause]

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:29,180
Thank You Dana and thank you for having

00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:31,009
us this is really exciting so my name is

00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,690
Christian I'm a staff developer on the

00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:34,190
payments team in Montreal and I'm

00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,740
Sebastian senior production engineer

00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,389
also Montreal so we're part of shop

00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,610
fight and for those who don't know

00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:43,490
Shopify we're ecommerce platform that

00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,710
allow for small medium and big merchants

00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:48,410
to sell their products across a plethora

00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,030
of channels and our core mission is

00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,509
really to make commerce better for

00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,930
everyone

00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:56,229
which also involves open source we're at

00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:59,169
around 4,000 employees now we have

00:06:56,229 --> 00:07:03,020
800,000 merchants across 175 countries

00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:05,990
and we have several offices around

00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:08,600
different cities including in Berlin now

00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,340
Ralph I started in 2006 and if you

00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:14,240
really want to be that 100 year company

00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:17,539
we need to invest in our stack and a big

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,460
part of our stack is rails rails being

00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:22,729
powered by Ruby we actually compete

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:25,060
contribute to its ecosystem in fact Toby

00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:28,789
our CEO used to be a core contributor

00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:32,000
now we also have a dedicated rails core

00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:34,099
team with contributors and as much as

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,010
possible we live on the cutting-edge

00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:38,270
releases of rails that allows us to

00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,720
benefit from the latest performance

00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:44,330
enhancements features and bug fixes many

00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,849
of which we contributed to it also

00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:49,880
allows us to reduce the maintenance cost

00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:55,760
but most importantly Foster's success

00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:57,530
for all the community thanks well I mean

00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,990
as much as rails development at the core

00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:02,030
of our business Shopify platform is

00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,340
actually a full ecosystem of different

00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,800
technologies I mean as the company grew

00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,539
our needs became more specific and we

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,060
needed projects that would properly

00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:12,889
tailor to our specific needs and after

00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:16,190
all writing code is part of the fun of

00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:18,740
solving problems excluding Forks Shopify

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:22,310
has over 200 open-source repos that are

00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:24,050
available out there and perhaps most

00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:26,870
important interesting story of an open

00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:28,849
source is boot snap so boot snap is a

00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,830
library that plugs into Ruby and

00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:31,900
optimizes and caches expensive

00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,610
computations

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,339
with a focus on reducing the boot time

00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:38,529
for rails for the Shopify core platform

00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:41,020
it was able to slash the boot time in

00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:44,229
for dropping from 25 seconds to Round

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:46,060
six I mean open source two years ago the

00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:48,279
project has received over a hundred fold

00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:51,279
requests and now it's activated by

00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:53,320
default in rails 5.2 powering all the

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:59,680
million or so rails website out there

00:08:53,320 --> 00:09:01,690
I mean Shopify believes an open doesn't

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,880
start at the publication of a project

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:06,640
but that it's much bigger than open

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,160
source internally we have a deep culture

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,870
of the transparency the vast majority of

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,240
our sack communications are happening in

00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:16,000
public channels and in the vaults are

00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,670
internal wiki we're able to facilitate

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,089
the search a call all of our shared

00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,670
knowledge

00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:24,010
I mean internal work is not about

00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:28,300
signing NDA's it's about people working

00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:31,600
together but what about the code I mean

00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:34,150
yes we use github and with very few

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,970
exceptions all developers designers

00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:38,980
content creators have access to all the

00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,860
repositories issues in project groups

00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,140
teams are encouraged to create repos and

00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:46,060
share between each other

00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:48,370
github essentially allows us to bring

00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:52,750
that open-source mentality inside

00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:54,610
Shopify with zero effort in projects are

00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:57,130
generally started by individual team and

00:09:54,610 --> 00:10:00,459
over time internal communities will

00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:02,290
start forming and around technologies

00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:05,350
and sharing their struggles and their

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:07,150
solutions I mean organically projects

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,560
become Co maintained and they spread

00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:11,500
throughout the company eventually

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,050
becoming the standard and recommended by

00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:16,120
default on our valve projects if and

00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:18,940
when those projects be are made public

00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,450
those same communities carry on and

00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:24,070
become the stewards of public facing

00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:25,660
github help us carry off the open

00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:30,220
philosophy throughout that development

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:32,620
cycle but allowing the communities to

00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,080
flourish that much tends to multiply the

00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:38,110
number of repositories throughout its

00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:41,770
years Shopify has created over thousands

00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:44,380
of repository and having so many repos

00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:46,360
comes with some complexity

00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:49,090
the role of my team developer

00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:52,480
acceleration is to reduce that friction

00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:55,600
to automate and to standardize I mean

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,060
our customers are the developers we want

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,950
to empower them and the better we enable

00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:03,190
them the better they go on and serve

00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:05,440
their own customers so we integrate into

00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:08,020
github is API and we provide tooling for

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,570
local development review testing

00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,550
production and even after production

00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:15,340
carries on and again the maintenance and

00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:17,230
that feedback loop that comes back well

00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,300
whether development is happening within

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:22,990
a team across team or out of the public

00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:25,840
the platform remains the same that's a

00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,970
lot of investment but connecting our

00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,440
teams with the rest of the world we

00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,760
allow the crowdsourcing of that

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:37,240
maintenance and the rest of the

00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:39,250
development so we've been doing open

00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,980
source for many years and I wish we had

00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:46,300
developer acceleration a decade ago so

00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:49,150
about around 2008 2012 we released two

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,740
open-source libraries under a sister

00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:53,740
getup organization called active

00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:57,310
merchants and the goal of those

00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:58,870
libraries were a means of quickly

00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:01,870
expanding the payments accepted by our

00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,820
merchants in new markets and at the time

00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,550
it was the easiest way we knew of for

00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:09,460
expansion so let me explain a bit the

00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,630
woodwork is partners would write their

00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,520
own implementation of those libraries

00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:15,610
those libraries would have just simple

00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:18,370
abstractions they'd open up a PR we'd

00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,920
review it then merge it back and that

00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:22,810
would save us from writing all the code

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,820
then we'd simply bump the version of

00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:26,800
activemerchant inside of our platform

00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,860
and merchants would instantly have

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,750
access to many more payment gateways so

00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,790
in that sense we ended up in a very

00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,490
interesting client provider relationship

00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:38,200
we not only provided the platform but we

00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:40,480
provided an SDK to work with the

00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,940
platform and this beneficial two-way

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,740
street of collaboration about growth not

00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,580
only for shop fire but for payment

00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:50,770
gateways to be included on shop fire and

00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:52,870
then being that it's open source it

00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:55,240
doesn't stop there right we also have a

00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,960
CO maintainer Spradley who uses the

00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:01,280
libraries in production as well

00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,990
and this is only one example of ours so

00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,580
investing an open-source means different

00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,860
things obviously different things for

00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:08,990
different companies of different stages

00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:11,300
but if done correctly applying the open

00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:14,060
principles to various communities be it

00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:16,910
internal or external blurs the lines and

00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:19,550
makes them interconnected having an open

00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,330
mindset is beneficial to everyone thank

00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:24,980
you

00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:33,980
[Applause]

00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:33,980
