00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,060
this year we've had hundreds of

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:20,250
conversations with maintainer x' and

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,050
open source contributors and I actually

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,910
have a practice that I'm really loving

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,919
right now which is I personally spend a

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,169
couple of hours every Friday having

00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:29,759
video calls with maintainer zuv big open

00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:32,220
source projects and small open source

00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:34,350
projects some of you I've talked to on

00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,149
Fridays before it's become one of the

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,219
favorite parts of my week for me

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:39,510
and it's also been in combination with

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,000
everything else we're doing a really

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,960
great way for us to learn from you about

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,059
the challenges and the opportunities

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,770
that you have in the open source world

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:49,410
and how github can serve you better and

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,480
so we have some pretty exciting news to

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:55,610
unveil today and to tell you more please

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,610
welcome Devon's oogle Devon

00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:08,490
thanks NAT hi I'm Devin and I'm the

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,790
product manager of the open source

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,890
economy team here at github our work is

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,870
focused on maintainer x' and building

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,920
tools for the open source community to

00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:23,520
thrive as NAT showed earlier we're all

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,250
connected the world runs on open source

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,860
none of it would be possible without the

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:32,040
global team of maintainer x' developers

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,290
designers researchers writers and more

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,590
who devote their time to pushing

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,470
technology forward like the scientists

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:43,259
on stage earlier today each of us builds

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:46,950
on the work of others and each of the

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:49,050
developers we depend on has a story let

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,670
me introduce you to a few open-source

00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:54,090
maintainer x' who's built software that

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,869
you've likely used yourself meat

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,270
mariotta

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,789
she's a Python core developer from

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,380
Vancouver and she has a ritual of taking

00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:05,610
an ice cream selfie after each

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,030
conference talk she gives and here's

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,030
fattie

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:12,540
he's from Ankara Turkey and he's the

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:14,760
creator of MgO thottie works from home

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:19,080
so when he needs a break he gets to play

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:21,180
with his adorable son Alper and meet

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,700
Henry who's based in New York City and

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:27,030
left his job last year to work on open

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,640
source full-time Henry is the maintainer

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,060
of Babel which is an NPM package that we

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:35,010
use here at github

00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:38,220
it's these developers that make the

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,530
github community what it is the strength

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,720
of its connected community depends on

00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:46,800
the continued success of developers just

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,500
like mariotta sahti and Henry and at

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,349
github this is the core of what we're

00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:56,190
about we're here to support the humans

00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:58,410
behind human progress in that spirit

00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:02,640
were thrilled to announce a brand new

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:04,349
feature of github I'm so excited to

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,780
share that today we're launching the

00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:08,939
beta of github sponsors a new way to

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,420
financially support the developers you

00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,420
depend on

00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:28,880
I'm really excited to this is the first

00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,320
step the the purpose of this beta is to

00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,780
get your feedback and we're really

00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,210
excited to hear from you so I bet you're

00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:39,500
just as excited as I am so let's see how

00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:41,660
it works to start let's sponsor mariotta

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,640
we'll head to her github profile and

00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:47,240
you'll see there's a new sponsor button

00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,280
right on her profile I'm a huge space

00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,560
nerd so I think it's awesome that her

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,320
contributions to Python played a role in

00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,120
creating the black hole image when I see

00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,180
that button I'm super excited that I can

00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,760
now show her my support clicking it

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,350
takes me to her sponsorship page here

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,120
she gets to decide how to represent

00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:09,200
herself and how you can best support her

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,480
now let's see this from maryadas

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,520
perspective when she goes to my profile

00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,650
or when she sees my profile hovercard

00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,260
she will see a new call-out that says

00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:21,830
your sponsor so she knows I'm invested

00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:23,780
in her work we've also built this into

00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:25,840
existing github workflows so that it's

00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,190
seen wants to support developers I'm

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,960
really excited about this because it'll

00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,060
surface developers that you can sponsor

00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,550
directly from the conversations where

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,770
you collaborate with them for instance

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,919
perhaps Patti has been really helpful as

00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,690
I make my contributions to Van Gogh

00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:43,310
imagine I've merged my first PR into the

00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:46,010
project and I want to thank him for all

00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,810
his help I can jump straight into the

00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:51,680
sponsorship page from the hover card on

00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:54,710
the PR but maybe you want to support a

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,480
project not a person to do that

00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:59,090
we've also added support for a new file

00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,620
called funding gamal that makes it easy

00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:03,860
to support the project however the

00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,990
maintainer is see fit when funding amel

00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,270
is added to a projects master bank

00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:11,090
branch a new sponsor button will appear

00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:13,040
at the top of the repo clicking the

00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:17,210
button opens a natively rendered view of

00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:18,919
the funding links listed in that file it

00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,660
can showcase the sponsor the 'get of

00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:23,030
sponsors profiles of the developers who

00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,620
contribute to the project or it can also

00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,320
link to other popular funding models

00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:32,900
including open collective community

00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:33,770
bridge tide lifts and more open source

00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,770
is

00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:38,660
the heart of github the developers who

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,030
build our shared digital infrastructure

00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,580
are what make this community so strong

00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:46,129
as a thank you for these valuable

00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:48,560
contributions github sponsors charges

00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:51,940
zero platform fees when you support the

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,940
work of other developers

00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:05,090
we'll also cover payment processing

00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:08,210
costs for the first 12 months of the

00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:10,400
program to celebrate the launch 100% of

00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:15,110
your sponsorship goes directly to the

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:17,000
developer github sponsors also supports

00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,390
payouts and all around the world in

00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,260
every country where github does business

00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,910
over the course of the summer we're

00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,880
excited to be working with strength to

00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:28,100
scale of this beta we're all part of a

00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,750
global software team expanding

00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,630
opportunities to participate on that

00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:34,820
team is at the core of our mission so we

00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:40,520
are proud to make this tool available to

00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:42,020
developers worldwide finally many

00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,790
contributions that are crucial to a

00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,640
well-functioning project don't show up

00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,740
in code review github sponsors is built

00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:53,300
for funding all types of work that

00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:54,980
advance open source software anyone who

00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:58,010
contributes to open source whether

00:06:54,980 --> 00:07:00,980
through code documentation leadership

00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:03,410
mentorship design technical writing I

00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,850
could spend the rest of this keynote

00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,919
listing things that go into an open

00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:11,570
source project all of those people are

00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:13,550
eligible for sponsorship github sponsors

00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:16,340
is one more way to contribute to open

00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:19,729
source financially supporting the people

00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:22,310
who build and maintain it starting today

00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:25,070
and in github user can sponsor an open

00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,510
source developer in the beta if you're

00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:29,030
interested in getting sponsored for your

00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:32,900
own work you can apply at github comm

00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:35,960
slash sponsors we're launching small and

00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,790
simple but our mission is fast to expand

00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:41,000
opportunities to participate in and

00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,380
build on open-source we're here to serve

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,850
the developer community and we're

00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,380
eagerly listening for your input for

00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,930
what you'd like to see and get up

00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:50,850
sponsors we're really excited to hear

00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:55,619
from you thanks and back to you net

00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:55,619
[Applause]

00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:03,140
Thank You Devin we are so excited about

00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,660
the launch of github sponsors and this

00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,820
new mechanism for supporting independent

00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,410
developers directly on github and we're

00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,330
equally excited to hear your feedback

00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,400
and learn how we can improve this

00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,650
program so please let us know what you

00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,350
think now Devin mentioned that one of

00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,150
the great features of github sponsors is

00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,950
that we cover all of your payment

00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:23,960
processing fees for the first year and

00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:26,000
that there are no platform fees so that

00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,970
a hundred percent of your contribution

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,760
goes directly to the developer that you

00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:33,349
sponsor and a hundred percent is amazing

00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,060
but we were thinking about it and we

00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:37,669
realized that what's better than a

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:40,099
hundred percent is two hundred percent

00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:42,200
so with today's announcement we've also

00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:44,320
created the github sponsors matching

00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,460
fund where we will double your

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,760
contribution to developers for the first

00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,760
year

00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:02,480
this enables us to really jumpstart the

00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:04,399
github sponsors program and boost the

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,259
contributions that you make while still

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,420
giving you the empowerment and the

00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:10,370
freedom to choose who in the open-source

00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,860
community you want to support so we're

00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:14,899
really excited about this okay we

00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,329
covered a lot of ground today so let's

00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:19,430
just step back and do a brief recap

00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:21,110
shanku talked to you about some of the

00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,970
new security features that we've

00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:25,189
released including maintainer security
