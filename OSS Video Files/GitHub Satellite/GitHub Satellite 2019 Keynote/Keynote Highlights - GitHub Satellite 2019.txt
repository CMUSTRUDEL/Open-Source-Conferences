00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:18,650
welcome to github satellite we are so

00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:21,050
happy to be here with you today in

00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,779
beautiful Berlin and we have quite a

00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:26,450
show for you today more people are

00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:28,750
joining github every day than ever

00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:31,490
before and so the audience here today

00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:34,699
represents the more than 36 million

00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:36,260
developers who called github home we

00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:38,199
have a lot of great announcements to

00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:42,050
show you in three different areas

00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:43,070
security enterprise and community we're

00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,930
going to show you the work that we've

00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,750
been doing to make software development

00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:49,339
more secure from end to end to help

00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,610
better support and serve large

00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:54,409
organizations and enterprises and to

00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:57,769
serve open-source maintainer and

00:00:54,409 --> 00:01:01,010
contributors this is the first ever

00:00:57,769 --> 00:01:03,110
picture of a black hole it was published

00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,059
just last month in more than four and a

00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,100
half billion people around the world

00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:10,159
have seen this image and the scientists

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:13,040
who created this picture used a global

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,630
network of telescopes to generate a huge

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,810
amount of data which they then composed

00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:20,600
into this image and this is the moment

00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,280
of truth right this is dr. Katie Baumann

00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,020
one of the lead developers and

00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,180
scientists on the project please welcome

00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:32,300
via satellite from Boston Massachusetts

00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:33,920
dr. Katie Baumann Katie taking the first

00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,990
image of a black hole was a huge

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,400
endeavor and took many people years of

00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,320
hard work in order to build the

00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,670
computational telescope that made it

00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,670
possible to see the unseeable

00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:54,659
it is so awesome to have the core team

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,490
that worked on the software behind this

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,740
black hole image here today I can't tell

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,799
how much we're all nerding out over

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,530
having you on stage it is amazing to

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,119
think of what the interconnected

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,920
community can do for software

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,830
development right like think about

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,680
strangers from across the world coming

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,690
together collaborating and building

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,930
amazing things and even creating human

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:21,230
progress that's so powerful with that

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,250
power there's also a need for

00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,769
responsibility we've got to build

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,110
software that is secure and trustworthy

00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:30,390
I want to share today some of the tools

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,930
that github is providing to help you die

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:36,269
think of github dependency insights as a

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,040
full overview of all of your

00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:41,700
dependencies what we're doing with this

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:44,040
set of tools is really helping build

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:47,120
security best practices in open-source

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,180
we're partnering with white source and

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,290
white source is an industry leader in

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,060
vulnerability data they collect

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,400
vulnerability data from lots of

00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,140
different places and thanks to white

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,329
source we are now making that

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,500
vulnerability data available through

00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:05,870
alerts in github

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:08,310
I am super thrilled to announce that

00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:11,069
dependable is now a part of the github

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,859
family and I am so pleased to announce

00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:15,900
available today these four new

00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:18,239
enterprise features that will help not

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,709
only me as an engineering leader but

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,920
countless other companies as they

00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:26,609
continue to innovate and they our

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:29,310
enterprise accounts internal repos new

00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:31,889
roles and permissions in organization

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,810
insights I'm so excited to share that

00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:36,120
today we're launching the beta of github

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,700
sponsors a new way to financially

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,690
support the developers you depend on so

00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,120
let's see how it works

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,040
let's sponsor mariotta we'll head to her

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,109
github profile and you'll see there's a

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,569
new sponsor button right on her profile

00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:50,910
one of the great features of github

00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:52,620
sponsors is that we cover all of your

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,690
payment processing fees for the first

00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,430
year and that there are no platform fees

00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,070
so that a hundred percent of your

00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,140
contribution goes directly to the

00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,900
developer the

00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,490
sponsor and a hundred percent is amazing

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,230
but we were thinking about it and we

00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,840
realized that what's better than a

00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:11,240
hundred percent is two hundred percent

00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,340
so with today's announcement we've also

00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,620
created the github sponsors matching

00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,630
fund where we will double your

00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,480
contribution to developers for the first

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:22,310
year at github our mission is to build

00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,470
the global platform for developer

00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,150
collaboration and that really means that

00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,550
our job is to serve you

00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,890
right to make your life easier to make

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,690
you more productive to help you connect

00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:35,120
to the developers and contributors who

00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,440
make your work possible so thank you for

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,090
