[Music]

00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,810
you

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:31,860
good morning all right welcome to github

00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:34,020
satellite we are so happy to be here

00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,780
with you today in beautiful Berlin and

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,970
we have quite a show for you today

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,129
welcome to the 800 people who are able

00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,519
to be in the room with us today and the

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:48,330
thousands more who are watching online

00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:51,000
this is a really exciting time for us to

00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:54,329
be at github more people are joining

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,579
github every day than ever before and so

00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,399
the audience here today represents the

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,460
more than 36 million developers who

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,680
called github home now today we have a

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,520
lot of great blockchain and I'm just

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,759
kidding there's no blockchain

00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:11,039
announcements we have a lot of great

00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:14,789
announcements to show you in 3 different

00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:16,410
areas security enterprise and community

00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:17,850
we're going to show you the work that

00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,000
we've been doing to make software

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,800
development more secure from end to end

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,070
to help better support and serve large

00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,869
organisations and enterprises and to

00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:30,390
serve open-source maintainer and

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:33,720
contributors but before we get into all

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,430
of that let's take a step back and talk

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,350
about what's really at the heart of

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,369
github which is the open source

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:45,000
community every day developers around

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:48,810
the world make millions of contributions

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,399
to open-source projects on github and we

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,799
thought it would be interesting and fun

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,020
to take our data set of that

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,960
contribution stream and actually

00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,869
visualize it on a globe and that's what

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,909
this is every little ray of light that

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,040
you see coming out of the earth and

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,810
going into space

00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,399
represents one contribution to an

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,370
open-source project from someone

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,310
somewhere on earth and I just I think

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,620
it's so cool this is real data it's over

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,140
a hundred million contributions over 30

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,730
days being visualized here and one of

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,890
the things that immediately stands out

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,130
for you when you look at this is how

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:28,980
global our community is right more than

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:32,070
80% of the contributions that occur to

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,410
open-source come from outside the US so

00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,270
in a way if your company

00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:40,260
your team is using open-source code

00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:43,140
you've already embraced promote work now

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,150
the chances are you have already started

00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,040
to use open source code because nearly

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:50,070
every software project on earth today

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,630
has open source dependencies so whether

00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,090
you're working at a large company or a

00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:57,600
start-up whether you're a scientist or

00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,970
student you rely every day on open

00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,550
source code and you rely on the people

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,830
who create it right every line of code

00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:07,260
that you write builds on the work of

00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,750
thousands of others and you can think

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,520
about it this way when you import an

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,750
open source library into your code

00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,690
you're not just adding code to your

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,750
project you are effectively adding a

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,910
team of developers to your extended team

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,100
you're actually almost giving them

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,740
commit access to your code that you then

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,970
put in production then you also get to

00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,850
benefit from the work they're doing

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:31,920
every day to improve their packages so

00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,020
this is the reality of building on

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,670
open-source and if anyone wants to make

00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,890
an editor extension that does this I

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,110
think that would be really cool but but

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,540
still in our heads we have this

00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,190
stereotype of the solitary developer

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,290
right when we think about the act of

00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:49,470
writing code we often think about a

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,780
developer alone in a dark room writes

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,150
just them in the computer writing code

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,950
and you sort of slip pizza under the

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,020
door and it gets converted into code and

00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,700
uploaded to the cloud that's still a

00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,510
mental image that we have when we think

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,739
about developers but in reality software

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,750
development is deeply collaborative

00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,970
right we're all a part of an

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,420
interconnected community of developers

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:15,470
and this morning I'm gonna tell you a

00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:18,540
story about how thousands of open-source

00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:21,500
contributors work together to help

00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:25,200
create a major scientific breakthrough

00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,810
this is the first ever picture of a

00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,520
black hole it was published just last

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,650
month in more than four and a half

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,690
billion people around the world have

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:37,190
seen this image it's very famous and it

00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:39,510
is a huge landmark achievement right

00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,610
scientists have theorized about black

00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,800
holes for decades but this is the first

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,840
time we've ever actually seen one and

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,030
this one is at the center of a galaxy

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,160
called m87

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,500
which is really far away it's 55 million

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,380
light-years away from us here in Berlin

00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,990
today in the scientists who created this

00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,780
picture used a global network of

00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,670
telescopes to generate a huge amount of

00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,860
data which they then composed into this

00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:07,980
image they spent years processing that

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,530
data to get this image and this is the

00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,690
moment of truth right this is dr. Cady

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,580
Bauman one of the lead developers and

00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:17,190
scientists on the project and one of my

00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,530
personal heroes and this has become an

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,870
iconic photo of this landmark human

00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:24,270
achievement I personally I love this

00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:27,000
photo because as developers we can all

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,160
identify with this feeling right it's

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,110
like it's that moment when your code

00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,630
finally just works you know when all

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,330
your tests pass when all your hard work

00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,340
kind of comes together it's a you look

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,020
at it and you feel that same feeling

00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,820
yourself and and it also makes you

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,120
wonder to to look at this picture right

00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:47,310
like what did it take to get to this

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,410
point what was involved what was the

00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,420
math and the science and the algorithms

00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,190
that were involved in getting here and

00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,450
then like what's going on on that

00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,050
chalkboard in the background there's a

00:05:54,450 --> 00:06:00,630
triangle there I have so many questions

00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,280
when I look at this and so here to

00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:04,530
answer those questions please welcome

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,900
via satellite from Boston Massachusetts

00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:12,800
dr. Katie Baumann Katie

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,800
[Applause]

00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,280
Caty we are honored and thrilled to have

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,110
you join us today you're in Boston right

00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,740
now and it's nearly 4:00 in the morning

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:31,460
there yeah I really wish I could have

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:33,380
been there in person well you're a busy

00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,700
person Katie so thanks for taking the

00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,220
time to join us in the middle of the

00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,440
night can you tell us a little bit about

00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:43,100
what it took to produce this image of a

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,930
black hole yeah of course so taking the

00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,000
first image of a black hole was a huge

00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,410
endeavor and took many people years of

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,330
hard work in order to build the

00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,940
computational telescope that made it

00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,590
possible to see the unseeable because

00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,480
the black hole we looked at is so far

00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,050
away from us it's 55 million light years

00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,000
away

00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,280
it appears incredibly small in the sky

00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,140
so it's about the same size to us as a

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,540
grain of sand would appear in Los

00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,760
Angeles when standing in New York and

00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,980
because it is so small we needed to

00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,200
build an earth-sized telescope in order

00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,610
to resolve the ring of light but since

00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,500
we couldn't build a single dish

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,210
telescope the size of the earth our

00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,310
collaboration instead spent over a

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:21,800
decade connecting telescopes from around

00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:24,410
the world using the precise timing of

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,970
atomic clocks and making an image from

00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,400
this telescope required that we not only

00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:30,410
develop new instrumentation but also

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,540
design algorithms to process and

00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:35,270
interpret the collected data to form the

00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:37,760
image and this required the expertise of

00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,620
a global team of over 200 collaborators

00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,480
who worked on developing cutting-edge

00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,510
instrumentation data processing

00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,460
theoretical simulations and analysis so

00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,440
my primary role in the project has been

00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,510
using techniques from both astronomy in

00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,490
computer science in order to combine

00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:54,500
information from the telescope's around

00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,680
the world to construct and verify that

00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,940
black hole image KT that's awesome

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,370
thanks for it's so wonderful to hear

00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,380
that from you directly now I have to say

00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,750
this picture of you has become so famous

00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:07,610
and I think part of the reason is the

00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,590
obvious sense of delight and that kind

00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,210
of feeling of Eureka you know that you

00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,730
have in that moment and that every

00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:17,450
developer knows a little bit what do you

00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:20,210
remember about that moment yeah

00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:22,640
definitely so this was really an amazing

00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,710
day it was a hot day in June the data

00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:27,320
had just finally been released to us for

00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,700
imaging and our collaboration decided

00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,810
actually to split ourselves into four

00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,370
teams

00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,260
by splitting ourselves into teams and

00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,779
having each team independently make an

00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:38,240
image we avoided a shared human bias in

00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:40,250
our results so anyway when the data was

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,770
released to us some of the members of

00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,720
the team I was on team one ran into a

00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,300
small room and we got ready to make an

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,100
image so we all had imaging scripts that

00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,200
we had each developed on our computers

00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,330
and we decided to press go on the stay

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,130
at the same time on all of them and so

00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,990
it was really amazing seeing the picture

00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:59,270
just start to appear on our screens and

00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:01,250
this picture was taken as that was

00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:04,610
happening and I was just flipping

00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:06,140
between awed disbelief excitement and

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,240
also just praying it wasn't some sort of

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:11,150
cruel joke and it wasn't really fake

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,640
data but most of all I think we were

00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:15,890
just so proud of what our collaboration

00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,650
had been able to achieve together and it

00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,029
was really an amazing day so Katie just

00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,260
described the scene a little more

00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:23,420
what is this room that you're in were

00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:27,440
you in Boston Massachusetts where this

00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:29,870
photo was taken yeah this picture was

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,330
taken in Cambridge Massachusetts in the

00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:34,580
office of the EHT director Shep Dolman

00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:36,080
and this is a building where a number of

00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:38,450
us actually spend a lot of time working

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,370
together but the funny thing about this

00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:43,520
photo is actually it's impossible to see

00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:45,080
Andrew my collaborator so unlike the m87

00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,210
black hole image which was truly a

00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,130
collaborative effort Andrew can claim

00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:51,470
sole credit for snapping this picture of

00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,810
me as he sat next at next to me making a

00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,910
picture of his own and similarly

00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,830
similarly on the other side of the table

00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:59,930
where a number of other team members and

00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:02,780
many others in rooms around the world

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:04,070
we're doing the exact same thing a lot

00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,540
of your other team members like you

00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,130
mentioned Andrew have become kind of

00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,690
famous and celebrated in their own right

00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:11,120
for their work on this project as well

00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:13,100
and in fact we have another surprise for

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,720
the audience here today Katie do you

00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,339
want to do the honors yeah sure so

00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,690
actually six of my colleagues from the

00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:24,410
team are there in Berlin at the

00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:27,190
conference with you all come on out give

00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:27,190
me a big round of applause

00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:46,280
it is so awesome to have the core team

00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,140
that worked on the software behind this

00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,360
black hole image here today I can't tell

00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,910
how much we're all nerding out over

00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,350
having you on stage why don't we go down

00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,460
the line and have you each introduce

00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,540
yourselves and just say a couple words

00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,640
about what you worked on

00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:02,120
so I'm Andrew I work on imaging so

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,430
designing sort of software to experiment

00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,320
with test and validate new methods for

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:10,520
converting the EH T's challenging data

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:13,250
into images that we can interpret I'm

00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:15,230
Kathy I'm that primary developer of one

00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,780
of imaging software packages and also

00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,730
developing new imaging techniques that

00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,500
created a first ever picture of black

00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:25,310
hole from the calibrated telescope

00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:27,350
dataset hi I'm Sarah work on data

00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,450
calibration primarily on modeling the

00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:33,080
behavior and sensitivity of all the

00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:35,720
different telescopes in our network hi

00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,330
I'm CK I occupy the cloud computing

00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,190
infrastructure for HT and I scale our

00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:44,270
algorithm and develop simulation

00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:46,430
software I'm Roman and a core developer

00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,050
of a parameter estimation framework and

00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:51,890
I do theoretical modeling to figure out

00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:53,600
why the image looks the way it does I'm

00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:55,490
Lindy I'm the primary developer of one

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,170
of our data pipelines so this is a

00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:59,750
process that takes the large and complex

00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:01,610
datasets from experiment and reduces it

00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,320
down to a much smaller and much simpler

00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,330
set of data that can be used to form the

00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,010
image I kind of want to applaud right

00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:16,710
now so let's do it

00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:18,870
[Applause]

00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,670
now Sarah you mentioned that you worked

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,890
on data calibration can you tell us what

00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,810
what that is so what we recorded the

00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:26,940
telescope's is actually mostly noise so

00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:29,160
the calibration process basically is the

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,470
process of combining all the data and

00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,750
taking out the very weak signal in the

00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:35,700
recordings and strengthening the signal

00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,440
modeling the instrument and atmosphere

00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,270
to be able to average down from

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,490
petabytes of data to all the very nice

00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:44,339
megabytes of strong signal data that

00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:46,410
then get passed down to analysis that's

00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:47,970
great and then Andrew you mentioned that

00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,410
you worked on imaging which I guess is

00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,779
kind of like a next step in the process

00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,190
can you tell us about how that works yes

00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,899
we don't actually have the resources yet

00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,640
to build a single earth sized telescope

00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,670
so as Katie mentioned the HD is a

00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,470
virtual telescope we need to devise new

00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:03,450
software and strategies for converting

00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:05,420
our data into images and inferring what

00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:09,089
it's a single telescope would see

00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:11,190
awesome and then CK Katie mentioned and

00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:12,839
and I think you mentioned also a little

00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,399
bit about the open source components

00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,930
that you used in the project can you

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,600
tell us about your stack with languages

00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:21,540
and packages did you use yes we use many

00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,959
open source libraries and once the data

00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:27,360
hit calibration and imaging status era

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:31,050
and Judis just described we are mainly

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,630
on a Python stack so your lump I type I

00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:35,790
SQL pie and my polyp are always very

00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:39,000
important to us okay that's awesome

00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:40,800
now this team is actually gonna be here

00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,459
all day and they're going to give a talk

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,260
at 5:20 today on this stage going into a

00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,610
lot more detail about the project and

00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,320
all the details of everything they did

00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,600
thank you all very much for being here

00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:55,950
and Katie thank you again for dialing in

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,320
from Boston thanks for having us this

00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:00,120
team is just the tip of the iceberg more

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,980
than 200 people worked on the event

00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,750
horizon telescope team and as I

00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,550
mentioned last week to Congress we're

00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,230
deeply grateful to all the open-source

00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:10,140
contributors who made our work possible

00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:11,640
as well thank you let's give these folks

00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,940
a big round of applause thank you all

00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,940
very much

00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:23,590
Thanks it's just so cool to have that

00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,310
team here I've been like handling them

00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:29,140
constantly

00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:31,330
so now as both Katie and CK mentioned

00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,550
the team actually used a lot of Python

00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:35,530
code and they made use of a lot of

00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,840
open-source Python libraries and the

00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:39,670
work that they did and their code is all

00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,440
public so we can actually go to the repo

00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,720
and look at it and we can also look at

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,510
their dependency graph and here it is

00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,010
you can see they've got quite a few

00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,710
different dependencies in the graph and

00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:52,690
in fact all together in the complete set

00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:54,460
of transitive dependencies that made up

00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:56,620
these Python scripts there's over a

00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,080
hundred different open-source Python

00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,880
packages and some of these are probably

00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,350
used pretty heavily some used a little

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,830
less oh but it's a really interesting

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:07,750
list to kind of look through and as we

00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:12,040
were scanning through this out of

00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:13,990
curiosity we started to wonder how many

00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:17,620
people did it take to build all of this

00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:20,650
right how many individuals contributed

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:23,890
to the full dependency graph that the

00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:26,260
event horizon team used and so we ran

00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:31,560
the query and the number turns out to be

00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:34,240
more than 21,000 people it's incredible

00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,020
21,000 people around the world were

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,580
involved in building these scripts and

00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:42,640
we have another surprise for you as it

00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:45,820
happens some of those 21,000 people are

00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,350
here in the audience today and so if you

00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:51,340
worked on any of these projects please

00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:53,550
stand up turn around face the rest of

00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,550
the audience

00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:06,269
we are so lucky to have with us today

00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:10,089
maintain errs and core contributors to

00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:13,779
numpy matplotlib sigh hi Astro pie

00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:16,299
panda's Python dynasty scythe on Kiwi

00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:20,350
solver and many other packages these

00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:22,929
people represents the 21,000 who were

00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:24,549
part of this extended team that made

00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:26,649
this work possible we're so proud to

00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:28,209
have you all here thank you each for

00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:30,519
your contributions to human progress

00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:30,890
let's give them a big hand again thanks

00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:37,780
everybody

00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:42,520
[Applause]

00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:45,100
thank you all okay so the image that

00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,600
needed a planet-sized telescope

00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,420
also really did truly require a

00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,370
planet-sized team to build it and by the

00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,980
way at least one of the people who's

00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:56,080
here when we called them up and invited

00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,600
them to come did not know that their

00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,460
work had contributed to the black hole

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,630
image and was very moved by that and I

00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,730
thought that was really cool

00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:08,350
it's sort of the magic of open source

00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:10,150
now as Katie said this is when you look

00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,920
at the team that's working directly on a

00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:14,319
codebase in a way you're looking at the

00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:16,660
tip of the iceberg right this isn't just

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,339
the story of this one software project

00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:21,040
this is the story of all software

00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:22,900
projects today that use open source so

00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,490
the tip of the iceberg goes direct

00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,689
contributors are the ones who are

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,910
building your code but below the

00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:29,950
waterline are the developers who are

00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:31,750
contributing to your dependencies and

00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,550
we've been using the phrase community

00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,380
contributors to refer to these people

00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:38,380
they're like the people who are here in

00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,940
the audience today and one of the things

00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,250
you might be thinking is well okay this

00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,080
event horizon team they wrote their code

00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,570
in Python they used a lot of high-level

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,700
astronomy libraries maybe they're an

00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,620
outlier right maybe this twenty one

00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,110
thousand number is a typically high and

00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:56,350
we were curious about that too so we

00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:58,780
decided to sample a thousand of the most

00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:01,690
popular repos on github including repos

00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:04,030
like WordPress and rails and tensorflow

00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,830
and others and we ran the query and we

00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,720
averaged it all together and we

00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:11,650
discovered that on average these

00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:15,990
thousand projects had more than 74,000

00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:15,990
contributors it's amazing

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,640
this is the actual size of our teams

00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:26,850
right think about it for a second this

00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:30,270
is more software engineers than work at

00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:32,070
Google or Apple or Microsoft it's

00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:35,250
actually more people than there are in

00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:37,650
the entire employee base of 90% of the

00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:39,120
fortune 500 and for a couple of you out

00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,580
there this is more people than the

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,400
population of Burning Man so it's a

00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,960
pretty big group and it's a testament to

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,200
how software development works today

00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,540
right it takes a community to write code

00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,460
so to make this interconnected community

00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,410
and the reality of this more concrete

00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,570
for each of us in our everyday work

00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:00,000
we're introducing two new features to

00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:02,820
github today community contributors and

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,160
dependent repositories so today if you

00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,690
go to a repo like this is numpy you can

00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:10,320
see that we actually call out how many

00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:12,030
contributors that repo has today well

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,470
we're adding a hovercard so when you

00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:15,150
bring your mouse up you can see the

00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:17,820
total number of community contributors

00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:20,400
you can see who they are browse them and

00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:23,640
get to know your extended team it's

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,620
pretty cool then we're adding a new

00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,270
signal for you to understand a repost

00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,860
popularity so right now when you look at

00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,380
a repo you can see how many Forks it has

00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:34,350
how many stars it has many people are

00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:36,870
watching it today now when we're adding

00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:39,450
used by so you can see how many other

00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:42,000
projects on github make use of the

00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:44,549
dependencies of the packages that are in

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,440
that repo we hope this is a useful

00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:49,559
signal of a repost popularity that can

00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,030
help you make better choices and for you

00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,530
as a maintainer it's pretty cool you can

00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:55,710
see how many people are using your stuff

00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:57,990
you can even click on it and see exactly

00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:01,290
who those users are and what's repos

00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:03,150
you've joined in the last week or so we

00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:05,040
screen shot at numpy a week ago and it

00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:07,290
went up by about a thousand users in the

00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,940
week so that was pretty cool so I'm

00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,260
personally really excited about these

00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,169
two little features they're rolling out

00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:14,490
today community contributors is Python

00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:15,960
first and they'll roll out to the other

00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,970
language communities after that and

00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,410
dependent repositories is available for

00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:22,679
all the languages supported by the

00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:25,260
github dependency graph okay so at

00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,000
github our mission is to build the

00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:29,190
global platform for developer

00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,040
collaboration and to make more stories

00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,130
like the one you

00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:35,140
this morning possible everyday and we're

00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:36,820
really here to serve you we're here to

00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,640
serve the developers and the companies

00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:41,650
who count on github every day and we've

00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,840
been spending a lot of time the last six

00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:46,300
months in conversations with developers

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,120
maintainer x' and our customers and

00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:52,420
using your input to shape our roadmap

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,770
and so today the new features that we're

00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,540
going to show you are based on the

00:20:53,770 --> 00:21:05,540
things that you've told us that you want

00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:05,540
