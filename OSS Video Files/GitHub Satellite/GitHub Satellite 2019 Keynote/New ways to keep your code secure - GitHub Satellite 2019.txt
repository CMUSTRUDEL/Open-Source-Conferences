Title: New ways to keep your code secure - GitHub Satellite 2019
Publication date: 2019-05-25
Playlist: GitHub Satellite 2019 Keynote
Description: 
	We’re all part of a deeply interconnected community, where the software we write builds on the work of others. Ninety-nine percent of new software projects depend on open source code. This extensive code reuse helps everyone build better software faster than ever before, but it also puts us all at risk of distributing security vulnerabilities from our dependencies. It’s more important than ever that every developer becomes a security developer—that they responsibly disclose vulnerabilities and patch vulnerable code quickly.

Today, we’re excited to announce several new security features designed to make it easier for developers to secure their code.
