00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:19,960
[Music]

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:21,970
hello everybody hi I am so excited to be

00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,150
here I don't know about you all this is

00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:27,220
my first time in in Berlin also so I'm

00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,170
so grateful to be here talking with you

00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,060
all today about what we've and going in

00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:33,129
a little bit deeper into what we've been

00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,410
working on but I don't know about you

00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:38,559
guys I was sitting up here in the front

00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:41,680
row watching that keynote and I swear I

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:45,549
wasn't crying I wasn't tearing up that

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:49,089
was so inspiring and what I'm going to

00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:51,460
talk about today is using open source in

00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:54,600
your enterprise and really using github

00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:58,449
to run your open source program office

00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:03,699
and I'm going to start by telling you a

00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:06,159
story on a spring evening in 1964 in

00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:08,770
Alaska would people were getting home

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,840
from work and families were just kind of

00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,820
starting to settle in for the evening

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,130
maybe they were thinking about what they

00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:19,660
were going to cook for dinner precisely

00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:21,850
at 5:35 p.m. Alaska time a megathrust

00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:25,920
earthquake struck off the coast of

00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:29,440
Alaska a little south east of Anchorage

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:33,520
now that earthquake lasted about five

00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,920
minutes that's a really long time for an

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,140
earthquake to be shaking I haven't even

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,530
been up here talking for a minute and

00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:44,710
that earthquake would still be going on

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:48,190
it registered a 9.2 on the Richter scale

00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:51,190
and that makes it the most powerful

00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:54,460
earthquake ever recorded in the United

00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:58,150
States history and the second most

00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:01,450
powerful ever recorded in the world and

00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:05,830
that earthquake spanned a radius of

00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:08,649
about 1.3 kilometers and the effects

00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:12,640
were felt far beyond the borders of

00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:15,330
Alaska in Seattle there were reports of

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,760
the Space Needle swaying back and forth

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,380
that earthquake was so powerful that

00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,570
almost every single

00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:26,140
state that had a Richter scale in the

00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:31,960
United States registered all the way to

00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:34,360
New York City and it kicked off a whole

00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,940
series of tsunamis that spread

00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,460
throughout the Pacific Ocean all the way

00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,680
down the coast of British Columbia into

00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:45,550
Washington Oregon California

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:50,010
it affected Hawaii and even even Japan

00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:53,290
and it even raised sea levels in

00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,870
Australia and what happened in the

00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:59,380
subsequent weeks after that earthquake

00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:02,530
struck was thousands of strong

00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,990
aftershocks kept on going and going some

00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,690
of these were recorded at 6.2 on the

00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:12,640
Richter scale which in and of itself is

00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:15,550
a massive aftershock so do you think the

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,930
citizens of Alaska at that time when

00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,550
they were sitting down to dinner do you

00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:22,390
think they knew that that earthquake was

00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:25,780
going to happen so I actually grew up in

00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:28,960
Alaska and preparing for that inevitable

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:35,080
earthquake it's something that I'm super

00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:38,110
familiar with in fact my parents were in

00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,970
Alaska in 1964 they lived in Anchorage

00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,830
and they both survived that earthquake

00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,060
they loved telling me about all of the

00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,920
things that they lost in their house

00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,930
they didn't lose anything that big I

00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,640
think my father lost a jar of peanut

00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,130
butter and my mother lost a couple

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,560
paintings off the wall but they still

00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:56,590
talk about that to this day they call it

00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,260
the Great Alaska big one and the thing

00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,990
about earthquakes is you definitely

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:06,730
cannot predict them and you can't

00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:11,260
prevent them so what we do is we prepare

00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:13,930
ourselves we make a plan so we know what

00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:17,080
to do when whether we're at home or at

00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:19,209
school or at work so we can get back

00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:22,870
together with our friends and family and

00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:25,120
make sure that they're okay also and we

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,980
do something called building a an

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,780
earthquake kit and in this earthquake

00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,500
kit it has all of the emergency

00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,510
materials that we might need

00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,630
the earthquake happens so that we can

00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:40,440
take care and start to rebuild and then

00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:43,320
we stay informed so that we know what's

00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:47,730
happening all around us what's going on

00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,980
with all of the aftershocks etc now

00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:52,560
today I live in San Francisco so

00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:55,830
earthquakes are still a really big part

00:04:52,560 --> 00:05:00,510
of my life and because I live in a

00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:02,850
high-risk area I really need to be able

00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:05,550
to stay abreast of earthquake news and

00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:08,580
information so that I can better be

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:12,840
prepared for a possible earthquake that

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:15,150
might impact my neighborhood and there's

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,030
another place I live that can sometimes

00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:20,850
be affected by unpredictable and

00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:24,960
unpreventable events and I think all of

00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:28,830
us in this room share this we also live

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:32,070
online writing and building software and

00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:35,210
just like living in an area that's prone

00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:38,280
to unpredictable events like earthquakes

00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,790
that require some some preparation

00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,790
writing and using software can also be

00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:46,950
high-risk and prone to security events

00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:49,050
so we need to be prepared we need to

00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:54,180
make ourselves aware of where we're

00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:55,350
susceptible to security breaches in the

00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,110
keynote this morning

00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:01,020
we just heard NAT and the team talk a

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:03,600
lot about the interconnected community

00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:06,000
and when you're using open-source

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,520
in your enterprise you may think you're

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,880
using just one package or just one

00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:15,780
component but that component actually

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:17,130
depends on many other ones and this can

00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,500
leave you feeling like it's really

00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,350
challenging to manage all of those

00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,390
integrations

00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:26,669
however these components are all powered

00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:29,490
by that interconnected community and

00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:32,610
that's much larger and much broader than

00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:37,169
your team and that brings a lot more to

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:39,150
the table than just the code itself so

00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:40,860
looking at an example here we're looking

00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:43,050
at lodash which is one of the most

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,510
popular JavaScript utility libraries

00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:47,940
there are 280 contribute

00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:50,820
- low - and almost three and a half

00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:55,230
million developers using it for their

00:06:50,820 --> 00:07:00,840
projects every single my open source

00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:03,170
library has a similar breath in reach so

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:07,320
when you look at modern art sometimes

00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:09,600
people would look at this and think yeah

00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,750
I could do that I could probably take

00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:15,420
some paint I can put it on a canvas and

00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:18,300
I think I could probably create

00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:22,200
something that's a lot like that but

00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:25,320
actually massive amounts of time and

00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:28,650
expertise and study and energy and

00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:31,020
collaboration go into creating a piece

00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:34,110
of artwork so this family that's looking

00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:36,960
at this they're not looking at just some

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:39,210
paint on a canvas they're looking at all

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,750
the time that went into creating a

00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,750
masterpiece

00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:48,090
99% of software projects today have open

00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:50,520
source dependencies and developers are

00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:53,850
handling more code integrations than

00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:56,040
they ever have before and by using open

00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:59,400
source libraries you're leveraging not

00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,530
just the code itself you get more code

00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:05,340
coverage more documentation and

00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:07,020
ultimately you get more time for your

00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:11,490
team you and your teams to think about

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:14,850
building products so as we use more open

00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:17,100
source the complexity also shifts from

00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:20,430
thinking about the code to thinking

00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:24,390
about things like licenses and versions

00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:26,820
and vulnerabilities it's not enough

00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:29,520
today to check all of that information

00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:32,190
for on your dependencies at the time

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,970
that you put them into your product or

00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:38,130
into your project you've got to be

00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:42,410
constantly vigilant and staying on top

00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:46,170
of the ever changing security landscape

00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:49,470
and often the teams that are staying

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:52,310
informed in your organization these are

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:56,310
people in the open-source program office

00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:58,190
and this is an entity in your company

00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:01,040
that sets up policies

00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:04,009
and processes and really these are the

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,190
people that work for you and your team's

00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:10,399
that are driving culture change about

00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:12,889
open-source engagement and you may

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,040
already have people who are doing this

00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:17,839
but you might not call it a nos PO and

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,180
these are really people who are

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:24,110
advocating for open-source sometimes

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:25,670
it's the office of the CTO and whether

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:28,129
you're just getting started with an

00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:30,649
open-source program office or you've

00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:32,439
been doing this for a while there's a

00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:35,060
lot of really great information

00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:37,370
available for getting started and

00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:40,250
managing open source programs in your

00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:42,829
organization and so these are two of the

00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:45,350
resources that I really like to use one

00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:49,220
is the to do group and the other is open

00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:51,290
source guides the to do group is an open

00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:54,350
group of companies who want to

00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:57,529
collaborate on practices and tools and

00:09:54,350 --> 00:10:00,310
other ways to run successful effective

00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:03,740
open source projects and programs and

00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:05,540
open source guides are a collection of

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,819
resources for individuals for

00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:10,459
communities and companies who want to

00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:12,319
learn how to run and contribute to an

00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:17,360
open source project so I definitely

00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:18,800
encourage you to check these out so when

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,839
we're thinking about an osco there are

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,870
some basics that I want I want you to

00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:26,569
remember and walk away from what is an

00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,009
ospa really need to be effective and so

00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:31,250
this is really getting at the core of it

00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:33,350
and that all starts with policies that

00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:35,689
minimize friction what we're looking at

00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:38,959
for this is really the minimum possible

00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:42,439
policy that gets at your core risks and

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:44,559
your core concerns and you want these

00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:47,630
these policies to be automatable

00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:49,850
oftentimes this is a small team in the

00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:52,759
AA SPO who is working on this across

00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:54,649
your much larger organization and so you

00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:56,540
want to empower them across the

00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:58,850
organization so that you can get as much

00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:02,120
data and information as you can

00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:05,269
and so you need things like license data

00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:10,670
security vulnerabilities test coverage

00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:13,790
etc and then the osco really needs tools

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:15,290
do you get gain insights into everything

00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:17,750
that they're using or that you're using

00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:20,480
across your organization you cross those

00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:22,610
tools with the data and then you can

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,890
understand where you might be vulnerable

00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:27,050
and where you might have to go into an

00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:30,890
organization and enact some of your

00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:34,040
policies and so these are just some of

00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:37,040
the basics of what an auspi needs and

00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:39,110
we're working with a lot with some of

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,530
our partners in the space to bring

00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:44,450
relevant and more critical information

00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:46,520
to every enterprise using open source

00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,680
you heard about one of them this morning

00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,960
in the keynote keynote shank you

00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,090
mentioned white source and white source

00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,400
is really working to bring security

00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:58,220
vulnerability data to organizations at

00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:01,520
scale so that you can better understand

00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:04,310
what's going on with your open source so

00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,530
speaking of the tools that the Osmo

00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:08,180
needs to be successful I want to show

00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:10,490
you a little bit more about what we've

00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:13,460
been working on to bring visibility

00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:18,950
about dependencies inside of your

00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:21,950
project so this is a demo organization

00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:26,030
that we put together to show a little

00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:29,060
bit more about dependency insights we

00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:31,250
know that today enterprises use a lot of

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,650
open source code and managing those

00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:36,260
dependencies can sometimes be a

00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:38,330
challenge sometimes I've seen people try

00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,820
to manage dependencies and spreadsheets

00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:44,600
before sometimes so what we really want

00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:49,490
to do is is empower people to get break

00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:52,160
out of the spreadsheet so dependency

00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:54,020
insights really helps you understand the

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,570
dependencies that might be putting your

00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,670
business at risk so you need to be able

00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:02,990
to do this in a super easy and efficient

00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:06,080
way across your organizations here I'm

00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:08,240
going to drill into a drill into

00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,760
dependency insights and look at my test

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,700
organization a little bit more I can see

00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,080
everything a tagged little 'evil I can

00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,320
see the licenses but what I'm really

00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:20,480
interested in is what's going on with my

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,130
critical vulnerabilities and so I'm

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,930
going to click into this bar graph and

00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:26,840
this actually filters

00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:28,670
everything by what I want to focus on

00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:32,210
first which is all of those critical

00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:34,850
security vulnerabilities and I'm gonna

00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:36,980
look at this first one action view I can

00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:39,020
already start to pick up a little bit

00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,780
more information about this I can see it

00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:44,390
has two security advisories issued for

00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:47,240
it and I'm gonna go and look at its

00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:49,370
dependence and right away I can see this

00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,700
version has an active security advisory

00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:54,680
and should not be used I get a little

00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,690
bit more information about where it's

00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,420
being used inside my organization and

00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:02,360
what the recent versions are and I can

00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:05,180
see exactly where my teams are using

00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,340
this across my org now I don't know what

00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,470
action view is and so I'm gonna click

00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,780
into the description and I'm gonna go

00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:14,090
read a little bit more about what this

00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,930
is so I know what my team's might be

00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:18,800
using it for

00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:21,800
I see license information I see I see

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:25,940
the description and but what I really

00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:27,110
came here for is to look at security so

00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,860
I'm going to click over to the security

00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:30,710
tab

00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,470
and as I'm scrolling down I immediately

00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:36,800
see information from the CVE that was

00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:38,180
issued for this component and I can see

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,610
the impact that it made

00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:47,780
I can see releases and I get information

00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:51,520
about workarounds and I can also see who

00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,520
to credit for all of this information

00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:59,199
so that was drilling into the

00:14:57,069 --> 00:15:01,600
information about a particular component

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:05,139
but if I have multiple organizations

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,660
within my enterprise I really want to be

00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:11,100
able to look across my whole business

00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:13,509
and zoom out to see dependencies

00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,999
dependency insights across all of the

00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:19,439
organizations that I manage so that I

00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:22,059
can see all this information at scale so

00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:24,209
what we're looking at here is a way to

00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:27,489
really spice and dice the information

00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:32,439
about and maybe serve my broader

00:15:27,489 --> 00:15:34,119
reporting needs for example I might want

00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:37,689
to search across every single

00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:39,910
organization in my enterprise and for a

00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:44,049
particular license usage that might be

00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:45,759
going against my company's policy so on

00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:47,829
the organization view of dependency

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,199
insights I can search for a specific

00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:54,610
license type here I'm searching for a

00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:56,920
gplv3 and see whether or not any of the

00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:58,959
projects or see whether or not anybody's

00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,689
using a project that has this particular

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:04,809
license and I can do that instead of

00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:07,149
going into every single organization and

00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:09,879
spending a day trying to research and

00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:10,449
find where this might show up I can do

00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:13,809
that

00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:23,079
from from this view across all of my

00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:26,259
organizations so we know that we can't

00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:29,410
prevent security breaches just like we

00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:31,749
can't prevent earthquakes they happen

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:34,839
they're a fact of innovation and

00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:39,160
software development but what we can do

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:42,160
is provide enterprises with the right

00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:44,499
with we can believe it can provide

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,649
enterprises with all of the tools that

00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:50,769
that they need to understand their

00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:53,529
dependencies and the code complexity we

00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:59,860
can arm ourselves with what we need to

00:16:53,529 --> 00:17:02,860
really be prepared so after that 1964

00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:07,889
earthquake in Alaska scientists learned

00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:07,889
a lot about how to better prepare

00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:13,260
they were actually able to implement a

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:17,260
broad earthquake monitoring system that

00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:20,020
gathered data to help engineers develop

00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:24,039
earthquake resistant structures that

00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:28,539
help to limit property damage and and

00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:31,539
injuries and also this thing called the

00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:34,150
tsunami warning center was created and

00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:37,600
this gives everybody who might be

00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:40,059
impacted by a tsunami that much broader

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,679
range of who could be impacted by an

00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,289
earthquake this gives them information

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,940
about what to do in case in case one

00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:50,400
happens so we can learn a lot from

00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,690
security risks just like these

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:57,220
scientists learned from what was going

00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:59,590
on after that earthquake hit and we have

00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,809
but we have to really be paying

00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:03,820
attention to what's going on

00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:07,000
and so what dependency insights is

00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:09,730
giving you is all of the data and all of

00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,640
the information that you need to go in

00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:14,470
and understand everything that that all

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:20,350
of the open source across your whole

00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:22,360
organization so today we saw several

00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:25,780
things being announced in the security

00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,950
space but really we're we're just

00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:30,549
getting started

00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:32,260
and we're really looking forward to

00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:34,900
learning just like those scientists in

00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:37,510
Alaska to learning about how you're

00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:40,030
using open source in your organization's

00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:42,330
what you might need how you might want

00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:44,890
to start using dependency insights and

00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:46,840
working with you to continue to build

00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,940
these tools so that they work very

00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,900
effectively for you and your

00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:54,940
organization's on your projects so if

00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,669
you're interested in this space I

00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,380
encourage you to reach out to us there

00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:01,630
are a lot of people here today who

00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:03,789
worked on these projects there's a lot

00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:05,770
of talks throughout the day as well

00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:08,230
there's one this afternoon about

00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:10,780
security vulnerabilities from Justin

00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:13,179
Hutchings and Brian Clark definitely

00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:16,060
encourage you to go check that one out

00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:18,250
and I think Jeff Mike

00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,690
Haffer is also in the audience Jeff can

00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,170
you raise your hand we just right over

00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:24,100
here

00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:27,250
can you stand up Jeff Jeff mccafferty

00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:30,400
kia hub to really understand what a NOS

00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:32,830
Kony's debt scale and so Jeff and I

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,350
after this talk we are going to head

00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:38,890
downstairs to the github ask product

00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:40,840
area and I want you all to come and we

00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:43,270
have a couple of demo computers down

00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,700
there I want you to all come and get

00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:47,650
some hands-on with these tools and we

00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:50,710
can walk through some of the scenarios

00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:52,990
that you might have and then and answer

00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:55,960
some questions about what is powering

00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:58,270
dependency insights and what how else

00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,100
you could slice and dice this data so

00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:02,260
please come talk to me and Jeff

00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,030
afterwards there are also some people

00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:10,270
who worked on this and built this

00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:13,590
