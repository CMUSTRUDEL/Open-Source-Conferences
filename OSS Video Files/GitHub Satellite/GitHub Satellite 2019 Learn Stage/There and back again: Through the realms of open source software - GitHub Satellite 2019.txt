Description: 
	Presented by Devon Zuegel, Product Manager of the Open Source Economy team

Join Devon in exploring the distant lands of open source. She's brought us back customs from programming communities far and wide, to borrow and remix to solve problems back at home, wherever that may be.

Through hundreds of conversations with open source maintainers, Devon discovered that each niche of the developer ecosystem has come up with ingenious techniques and thoughtful methods of coordinating work, investment, and decision-making.
