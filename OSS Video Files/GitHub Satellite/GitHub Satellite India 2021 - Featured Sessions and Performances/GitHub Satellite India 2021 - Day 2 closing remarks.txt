last two days

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,719
as we celebrated the india developer

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,079
community

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,760
it has been a pleasure uh serving all of

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,840
you over the last one year

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,079

the session started yesterday with erica

00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,800
sharing with all of us how we've grown

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,600
to

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,680
more than 5.8 million developers from

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,640
india who call github their home

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,560
it is super super exciting to see that

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,360
we added 1.8 million over the last one

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,119
year

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,960
but what's more exciting and current

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,840
talked about how i always love

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,159
anything open source has been seeing

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,400
that

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,159
indian developers have been driving the

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,880
most engagement on open source over the

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,159
last one year

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,520
on github this is just fascinating

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,600
you know i come from a very uh different

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,360
era i i started coding in the last

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,840
century i always like to say this

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,920
because

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,200
i keep people guessing you know what my

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,640
real age is

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,000
um but it's so great to see the

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,399
changes that have been happening in the

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,439
ecosystem with young developers like

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,520
yourselves

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,040
innovating and contributing back to the

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,079
open source community

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,479

which is about transforming the internal

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,959
three pronged approach

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,560
first is modernizing employee experience

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,280
second is building a strong

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,319
data and integration foundation third is

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,920
modernizing our application ecosystem

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:11,280
on enterprises cloud first mobile first

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,080
strategy we have to be kind of very

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,599
nimble

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,320
and agile in our processes

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,479
and we also need a cultural shift in

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,000
terms of how we deliver our products and

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,240
services

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,560
our entire engineering processes and

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,919
tools have undergone transformation

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,440
using github and devops hundreds of

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,320
software professionals now

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,360
on github the conversation is shifting

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,759
towards

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,000
how do i engineer the code how do i

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,840
internalize the best practices available

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,840
in the industry

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
thank you hari let me now talk about

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,479
some of the programs that

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
erica mentioned and i'm sure all of you

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,960
are as excited as

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,880
i am when we announced it yesterday and

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,080
these programs are really going to drive

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,320
the engagement for

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,520
developer communities across students

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,479
startups

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,600
and the open source community many of

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,680
you have already

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,199
started applying for these programs i am

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,960
so overwhelmed

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,479
by the mails that we've received from

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,720
each and every one of you over the last

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,360
24 hours since we announced this

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,000
i do request you to leverage these

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,160
programs

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,680
and give feedback a lot of these

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,120
programs we have created

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,199
over the last one year based on the

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,320
feedback that each and every one of you

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,919
gave on what you expect from github

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,680
we are really looking forward to

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,240
feedback coming our way for creating

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,160
more such

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,000
programs to drive the engagement with

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,960
developers like yourself

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,600
and the whole purpose of this is you

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,639
know to get

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,680
more and more developers on the platform

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,840
like at home there is a huge

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,280
generational shift that's happening in

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,840
the industry today

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,199
with more than 500 million applications

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,400
that are slated to be written

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,520
by 2023 which is more than the last 40

00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,919
years combined

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,120
i think it's a great opportunity for

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,280
open source

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,880
for students who are stepping into the

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,440
software development world

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,520
and also for enterprises to leverage

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,680
github to really build software

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,520
and that's been our purpose ever since

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,120
we started our operations last year to

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,759
serve you better

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,840
to be closer to what you would require

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,280
from a platform like github as we push

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,160
the boundaries of

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,600
uh developing applications to move human

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,240
progress

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,600
so really excited to be here and in a

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,759
way it's been great

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,440
um doing this virtual session with you i

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,160
can share that you know last year when

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,680
we were

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,160
kicking off um our operations we did our

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,440
kickoff on valentine's day 14 february

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,600
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,199
it's so vivid in my mind uh it feels

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,240
like 10 years but it's only been one

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,199
year

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,080
we were you know expecting 250 300

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,560
people to show up

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,479
and we had 2 000 people show up at the

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,280
event and it was a physical event

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,919
and we were overwhelmed by the love that

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,560
we got

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,080
from developers and i'm sure by now

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,000
doing this virtually we were able to

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,160
reach out to more and more developers

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,160
across the length and breadth of india

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,759
