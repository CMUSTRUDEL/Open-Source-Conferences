Title: GitHub Satellite India 2021 - Opening performance: live-coded musical experience using ORCA
Publication date: 2021-03-28
Playlist: GitHub Satellite India 2021 - Featured Sessions and Performances
Description: 
	Presented by pdmnbhn | beatnyk, Independent Sound Designer/Engineer

This performance was inspired by pdmnbhn’s quest to understand how receptive conventional sound design techniques are to coded algorithms, and how to sculpt his sound around it. In pdmnbhn’s setup, he has internally patched ORCA, an esoteric-language program created by Hundred Rabbits, to his Ableton via LoopMidi. The code in ORCA will trigger different midi notes in different channels of Ableton loaded with synths and drum machines. In the background, he will tweak the knobs on Ableton to design his sound for the code.
