and to show you how you can use them

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,760
together to build software across the

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,600
world

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,520
now yesterday erica was here to

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,159
celebrate all the amazing things that

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,040
are going on

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,720
in the github community in india growth

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,640
of the community here has been

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,040
incredible in the last year 1.8 million

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,720
developers have joined github from india

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,439
and over a million developers have

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,240
created their first repo on github

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,360
india has now become the fastest growing

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,119
country in the world

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,520
in terms of developers contributing to

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,759
open source that is amazing

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,680
erica has also announced a new set of

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,960
github programs in india that we're very

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,720
excited about

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,720
the github grants for open source

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,960
program which will provide

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,079
10 million rupees of grants to open

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,479
source projects

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,759
based here in india the github

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,280
accelerate program

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,680
which will partner with startup

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,600
accelerators and the indian government

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,600
to expand support to over a thousand

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,360
startups with our complete platform

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,880
and finally the github externship

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,719
program for students

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,560
which will provide participating

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,520
students a chance to get real-world

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,000
experience

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,239
working with software companies and

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,800
we're really thrilled to see what you

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,599
are accomplishing with github here in

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,840
india

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,640
this community is poised to double in

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,640
the next

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,360
two years and we're excited to see what

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,040
you will build with github next

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,640
now github is the world's largest

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,200
developer community

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,800
and it is for a purpose and that purpose

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,800
is to build together

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,959
we think of software development as the

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,040
world's largest team sport

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,239
and we believe that it is a sport

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,560
without borders

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,560
now i was born in india and i moved to

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,760
canada when i was young to study

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,440
computer science

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,680
and i had to move again to the united

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,280
states to take advantage of the best

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,200
opportunities in tech

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,040
that was the reality back then right if

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,800
you wanted an opportunity you had to

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,120
move to go find it

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,720
remote learning remote work global

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,319
companies these were all concepts that

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,959
were unheard of

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,920
but today it is possible for a team of

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,080
strangers

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,319
to come together from across the world

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,640
and build incredible things together

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,519
and this is what we see on github every

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,080
single day

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,840
collaborations and contributions from

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,720
developers all over the world

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,040
in real time and it's also increasingly

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,879
the reality at work teams of all shapes

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,280
and sizes companies from all over the

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,879
world

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,120
are going remote and they're going

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,959
worldwide to tap into the best

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,000
developers whether they come from

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,319
mumbai or mombasa or miami

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,360
and those developers need to be able to

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,840
work together

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,599
on projects from wherever they are

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,480
that's what i love about github github

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,640
was built for this kind of collaboration

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,159
so today i want to take you on a tour

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,200
through github's products

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,840
and show you how you can use them to

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,760
build from wherever you are

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,000
now do you remember your first time

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,599
joining a software team i know i do

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,280
that thrill of writing code and

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,200
committing it for the first time

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,640
and seeing it in a product right but

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,519
first there were all those things you

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,920
had to go through

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,959
right setting up your dev box setting up

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,560
your tools

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,879
getting your code and looking through it

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,519
to learn going through docs and style

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,879
guides

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,640
all of those things that you had to

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,120
learn before you can contribute

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,760
something

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,560
without messing it up even with the best

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,359
mentor

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,600
to help you that could take days and the

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,479
reality is today you have to do that all

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,880
the time

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,520
developers almost never work on just one

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,440
thing

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,160
you're always having to switch context

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,280
work on different projects fixing live

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,759
site incidents

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,280
contributing to other teams code or even

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,800
just learning something new

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,840
that is not easy on average it takes

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,280
over 23 minutes to switch context and

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,040
get into the flow

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,479
and that is if you've got everything set

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,040
up for you often it can take a lot

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,240
longer

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,400
so github we care about this a lot we

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,040
want developers to be able to get into

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,199
the flow

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,800
get into the code and contribute whether

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,280
they're joining a project for the first

00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,040
time

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,479
or just getting back into it after a

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,280
while to show you

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,960
how github helps you get in the flow

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,479
here's neha

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,000
hi i'm neha i'm the director of

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,600
engineering here at github for the team

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,039
that works on discussions

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,880
i'm pleased to announce that we've now

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,720
enabled discussions on private repos and

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,240
that means for this private repo we can

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,280
have our team conversations here and

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,199
leave our issues

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,280
for tracking our work here we have some

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,039
internal chat about skylines these cool

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,639
3d printed contribution graphs that

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,039
people have created using a website we

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,560
built

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,320
but we also use discussions to talk

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,199
about ideas in the team and with others

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,360
in the company

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,120
my teammate diana had an idea here the

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,639
other day about adding a year selector

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,639
to the page and i really like that

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,000
so i want us to work on this so let's

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,600
create an issue from this discussion

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,759
thread and track the work so i'm just

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,600
going to go in here reference the issue

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,919
give it a title and then i can just

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,520
scroll down and i can create the issue

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,960
so this shouldn't be too hard and i'm

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,560
thinking i might be the one to pick this

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,400
up and so we can do it together let's

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,919
just take a quick look so i'm going to

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,720
go over i'm going to assign the issue to

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,479
myself

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,919
and you can see that this isn't the code

00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,880
base that i work in every day this is

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,560
just for fun

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,319
so rather than downloading all the

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,840
dependencies to my machine and getting a

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,479
full development environment set up

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,800
locally

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,720
i can open a code space right here in

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,560
github and i can get my own personal dev

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,560
box in the cloud right away

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,080
and this isn't just running the visual

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,600
code editor in the cloud

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,520
this is a full-blown personal

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,680
development environment in the cloud

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,960
so for example if i like go over to the

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,520
terminal and i type in

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,400
npm run dev here in the console i can

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,039
get the full

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,759
local development experience as if i'd

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,639
had the code

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,479
locally on my machine codespaces even

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,280
sees when my code is running a server on

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,520
localhost

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,319
and so it'll let me connect to it across

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,240
the internet

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,160
taking care of all of the https

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,360
tunneling and authentication to ensure

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,960
only i can see

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,759
what is running on my dev box in the

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,639
cloud so let me type in my github id

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,440
nerd neha

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,880
and let me check out this awesome graph

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,759
so this site's pretty awesome it's got

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,680
like a

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,160
nice soundtrack and the coolest part is

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,639
it's running on my dev box in the cloud

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,199
but yeah 2020 isn't really a year i want

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,039
to remember

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,960
so let's get started on that issue that

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,479
diana mentioned by adding a year

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,400
selector here

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,599
codespaces is already authenticated with

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,440
github so actually

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,880
i can actually just go to the github

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,000
extension in vs code

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,680
and it has my issues already listed so

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,639
if i click on it you can see the issues

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,080
listed here

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,479
i'm going to find the issue that i

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,919
created and start working on my issue

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,360
and you can see that it's already

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,479
created a new feature branch for me to

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,319
add my changes

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,240
so all i have to do now is take a look

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,720
at the files so i'm going to go over

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,960
i'm going to find the form part which i

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,479
happen to know is called hero.view

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,080
and i know that the code that i want to

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,800
add in is between the at symbol and the

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,319
submit button

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,919
so i'm going to quickly add the code for

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,840
a year selector and then i'm going to

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,599
hit save

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,280
now this is a full development

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,400
environment so if i just jump back into

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,319
my application

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,840
we can see it's refreshing just as if i

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,599
was running code locally

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,879
and it'll start to bring up the selector

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,639
there it is so

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,319
i'm going to type in my username again

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,720
and i'm going to test it with the 2018

00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,080
year

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,319
i know that i had like a pretty good

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,440
year that year um and also i had this

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,479
like great break for summer and

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,360
thanksgiving

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,319
so i want to see if those show up uh and

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,199
so

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,000
here we go okay so you can see my

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,919
skyline

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,280
and you can see that like i even at the

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,720
end there's like some nice gaps it's

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,919
when i took my end of your vacation

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,160
super seriously

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,360
um and so this is all running in my

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,759
private development machine

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,680
in the cloud um i can come in i can mess

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,360
with the graph i can scroll around

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,280
and so i know that this works and i'm

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,720
ready let's commit this and let's share

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,479
the changes with the team

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,399
so what i want to do now is i want to go

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,839
back to my editor and i want to first

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,560
commit that change locally

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,000
so i'm going to go into the get view and

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,760
you can notice it already includes a

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,560
link to the issue that we're working on

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,959
and so then i can go ahead i can commit

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,159
it

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:45,760
and now i'm going to create a pull

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,600
request so i can do that by going

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,120
straight to the extension

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,959
and then i'm going to go into my github

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,399
view i'm going to create a new pull

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,240
request it's going to figure out which

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,120
branch i want to compare to and it's

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,519
going to even

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,560
publish the branch for me so i'm just

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,720
going to scroll down here

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,399
hit create and then i can create the

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,160
pull request and it's going to do all

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,680
the work of publishing the branch

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,200
pushing the changes in the server and

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,279
even creating the pull request in the

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,240
server so you can see my pr it's like

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,440
right here

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,279
so if i go back into my repo on github

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,320
i can navigate over to the pull request

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:21,839
tab so let's do that really quickly

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,000
and there you can see my pr is available

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,000
your selector for graph and you can see

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,600
that it's ready for my team to review

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,519
and i can see that the ci builds have

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,160
already kicked off so i can

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,000
to verify my change so let me go in i'm

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,720
going to tag this with the enhancement

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,640
label

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,320
and then i'm gonna you make use of this

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,440
super cool new feature it's called auto

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,839
merge and github

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,000
and so what i'm doing here is i'm having

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,279
the pr get merged automatically as soon

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,120
as all the checks are complete

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,560
and the code has been reviewed by the

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,040
team and so i don't have to do anything

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,720
here

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,480
and this leaves me free to get on with

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,440
my next change in the meantime let me

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,440
hand you back to shanku

00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,600
thanks neja now once you've written your

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,440
code

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,839
it's time to get it reviewed and

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,360
committed now code reviews have also

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,200
changed in this new world

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,040
used to be that you could invite someone

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,480
over to look over your shoulder

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,320
and review your changes and give you a

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,360
quick thumbs up but now that you're

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,279
working on a distributed or remote team

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,880
you still need that review you just need

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,920
new ways to do it

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,320
now on github everything about code

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,000
revolves around the pull request and the

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,839
code review experience

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,279
pull requests were designed to let

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,079
strangers review

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,760
and collaborate and commit code together

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,880
now during the last year as teams have

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,079
become more remote

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,079
we've seen something amazing on github

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,680
developers are actually submitting pull

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,920
requests for code reviews

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,160
more often than ever before as much as

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,640
30 percent more frequently

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,120
and when they do those pull requests are

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,120
getting reviewed faster than ever before

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,800
and that's good news if your prs are

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,959
more frequent and smaller

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,720
they're easier to review and that leads

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,959
to higher quality code reviews

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,000
and higher quality code and when they're

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,079
easier to review

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,120
they also get reviewed faster which

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,480
means that they get

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,880
committed faster and shipped faster

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,240
better prs also means not just having

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,360
human helpers

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,160
but the bots github actions

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,399
and our amazing ecosystem provides an

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,760
integrated ci platform with thousands of

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,440
custom actions

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,519
written by our community that can

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,160
automate all sorts of reviews

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,519
running your unit tests applying linters

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,519
and style guides

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,360
checking your dependencies and just

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,800
helping you commit better code

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,240
to show us more here is a tool i'm atul

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,120
and i work on the databases team here in

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,720
hyderabad

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,399
this is the pr from neha where she has

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,440
added a new ear selector to the site

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,120
that we are building

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,399
for every change we make to the site we

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,600
build and test it automatically using

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,120
data actions

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,360
let me show you the ci bill for neha's

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,560
latest changes if i go into the assembly

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,560
view you can see the brand new

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,079
visualizer showing us running the build

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,639
and test steps on both mac and linux

00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,560
machines

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,320
all at the same time this takes

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,440
advantage of data actions and our hosted

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,079
build runners which provide you with

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,480
secure

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,480
build servers on demand all of this

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,360
infrastructure is managed for you by our

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,880
team at github

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,639
so that you can add new build machines

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,240
whenever you need them for either linux

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,600
windows or the mac

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,600
let's go back let's look at how the

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,360
build is configured our workflows are

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,160
defined in the dark data folder under

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,519
workflows

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,800
we are going to look at the ci build

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,320
first we can see that it is triggered by

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,760
new changes in the main branch but also

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,040
by any pull requests that are targeting

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,800
the main branch

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,160
we also define which operating system

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,920
and node versions we want to run our

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,760
build on and then we build our code

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,959
on the linter and do a full test shoot

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,880
pass the actions community is fantastic

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,079
with over 7000 open source actions in

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,079
the marketplace

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,600
in the ci build we have added an awesome

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,440
community action from tim lucas and

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,639
joseph peterson that will update draft

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,800
release note for you

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,320
based on your issues and full requests

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,519
so that's that's the power of community

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,079
for you

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,079
that you can use to transfer ci we also

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,399
create and deploy a test environment in

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,040
the

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,480
cloud for every single pull request this

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,160
makes it easy for us to review the

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,000
changes in a working environment

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,440
so let's take a look at the dev test

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,200
development workflow which is run

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,480
in parallel alongside our ci bit so as

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,839
you saw this is triggered by

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,000
pushes domain along with new pull

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,440
request we come in get the code and then

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,120
deploy it to our cloud provider using a

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,680
secret which we store securely inside

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,240
github's

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,000
built-in secret store we've also added a

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,279
job to this workflow that will come back

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,120
and destroy the environment when the

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,760
pull request is closed to keep our costs

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,959
down

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,959
so let's go back to the pr from the pr

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:32,160
from neha and review it

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,839
um let's scroll down i can see the link

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,160
a link that has been added by the

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,600
deployment so i can click on that and

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,320
quickly test the changes without having

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,079
to install anything myself

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,480
i can see that the new here selector is

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:47,120
there so let's just enter a name and

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,800
selector here 2018 and then take a look

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,960
at the graph

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,519
uh the graph is loading

00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:56,959
[Music]

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,440
and yeah i think the

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,199
contribution block looks good it has the

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,000
ear as well so i think the ear selector

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,959
is working we are able

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,639
to select the ear as well as uh sheet on

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,760
the contribution graph so let's go back

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,880
to the pr

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,880
and let's review the code

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,720
the code the code looks good so let's

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,079
just say lgtm

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,600
and quickly approve the code now because

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,440
it has enabled auto merge

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,120
s1 has approved the change the code is

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,720
deployed the code is merged

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,320
automatically and data actions take care

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,279
of destroying the test environment for

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,920
me

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,000
so everything just works end-to-end back

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,600
to shangri

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,040
thank you now by using github pull

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,839
requests and actions

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,800
we are seeing our customers ship code to

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,440
production

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,920
way more often but it's not just enough

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,560
to ship

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,760
faster you also have to ship safely and

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,160
securely

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,120
one leaked secret one vulnerable piece

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,440
of code

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,399
one insecure dependency can cost you

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,880
time

00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,760
cost you money and cost your customers

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,440
trust

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,519
now we're humans and humans make

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,440
mistakes it turns out

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,040
the majority of security vulnerabilities

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,279
are just human mistakes

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,800
and once those mistakes get into code

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,800
they're hard to get out

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,120
so if you can fix those mistakes before

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,160
you ship or even before you commit code

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,320
that's great

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,000
and if you can't then the quicker you

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,959
can fix them once they're found the

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,360
better

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,800
so with github security tools we're

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,199
trying to put security

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,360
where it makes the most sense right into

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,839
the developer workflow

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,959
so you can find and fix these issues

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,880
more quickly

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:38,800
so to show us more here is niroshan

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,959
hello everyone my name is niroshan

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,440
rajiduri and i'm part of the application

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,800
security field team here at github

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,160
and i'm going to talk to you about the

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,560
work we've been doing in this space

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,959
through a quick demonstration

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,440
in our example here we have advanced

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,360
security enabled in our organization

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,120
and this allows us to easily switch on

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,720
code scanning and secret scanning for

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,399
our private repos

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,320
but everyone can still use these

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,800
features on your public repos

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,639
for free just go to the security section

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,680
of your repo settings and switch it on

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,600
there

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,279
i can get an overview of the security

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,680
situation for my project from the

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,680
security tab in the repo

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,759
beginning with supply chain issues here

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,360
we have dependebot enabled

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,360
it is automatically looking for

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,279
vulnerabilities with my dependencies and

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,160
it will create a pull request for me

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,720
if one of them needs updating looking

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,720
here

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,839
i see dependable is telling me about a

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,320
new release of

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,000
one of the actions that atoll was using

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,000
it's a minor revision so i'm going to go

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,360
ahead and approve this change to keep us

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,880
up to date all the tests are passing

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,279
so i'm going to go ahead and merge this

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,079
change now even our build processes can

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,240
be kept up to date with dependerbot

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,480
back to the security tab i see that

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,279
secret scanning is also active

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,600
let's take a look to see if any of my

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,600
team

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,759
accidentally checked in secrets or api

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,279
tokens so we can stop them from being

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,040
externalized

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,880
if we look at the closed issues we can

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,600
see one of my developers accidentally

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,079
checked in

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,600
code that included a token in the past

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,919
so we've actually revoked that and

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,760
removed it from the code

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,360
so that's known vulnerabilities and

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,799
sequence taken care of

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,919
but what about our unknown

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,919
vulnerabilities with codeql from github

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,600
we're able to scan our code base looking

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,679
for code which could be introducing

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,600
potential security vulnerabilities into

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,679
the code that we're writing

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,160
as you can see it's identified one here

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,480
for me i can show the code part that was

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,400
found with code ql's analysis tools

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,919
and i can see that this is definitely an

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,840
issue however

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,320
it doesn't look like it'll lead to a

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,000
major exploit in our case

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,320
but let's create a quick issue from the

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
code so we don't forget about it

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,080
this should be a simple fix to

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,280
explicitly to string the value from the

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,120
url

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,200
i'll also mark this as a good first

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,640
issue in case someone wants to pick this

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,960
one up

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,480
once i'm happy we'll save the issue to

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,640
make sure we don't lose track of the

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,799
work we want to do

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,559
excellent we'll get back to working on

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,320
that right away

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,160
while we've had the security tab on your

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,919
project for a little while now

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,440
today i'm pleased to announce that

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,600
enterprises with github advanced

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,000
security now have a security tab added

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,400
to their

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,200
organizations where you can get a quick

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,000
summary of

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,760
all the projects you also have an

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,600
overview of all the projects in your

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,440
organization and what the status is of

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,120
their security features

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,360
i'm also pleased to announce that this

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,600
is now available to teams who can see

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,799
the security status of the repositories

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,120
that they administer with that back to

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:40,240
you shanku

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,640
thank you niroshan now we've got our

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,600
code

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,039
written reviewed and committed where our

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,840
code really belongs

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,039
is in our users hands and that means

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,039
shipping

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,640
doing the functional testing sharing

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,840
with stakeholders and getting them to

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,440
sign off

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,880
and releasing the production and

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,600
celebrating together

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,440
now github's new tools were designed to

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,160
make it easy to test and release

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,720
together

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:09,200
as a team to show us more here's katie

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,720
thanks shanku hey everyone now we have a

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,280
release that's ready to head out the

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,200
door

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,320
thanks to a tool we already have a draft

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,919
of our release notes

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,240
let's edit a new release based on the

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,520
draft notes

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,280
first i'm going to set the title

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,720
then i'll check the draft notes that

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,720
were automatically created

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,960
to be honest these look pretty good

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,880
already so i'm going to go ahead and

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,960
publish this release

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,880
now we have a workflow set up in actions

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,559
to be triggered by the publication of a

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,120
release with our new

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:44,559
workflow visualization ui you can see

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,320
the release is now deploying to staging

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,320
then it will run some end to end smoke

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,240
tests before finally deploying to

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,160
production

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,679
while all of that is running let me show

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,520
you how i've set this up

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,720
let's take a look at the code in another

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,679
tab

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:03,280
in the github workflows folder we'll

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,520
find the releases.yaml file

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,360
in the release yml you can see i've set

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,919
up a couple of different triggers

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,840
a manual trigger with workflow dispatch

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,240
as well as triggers based on when a

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,600
release is published

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,919
in the deploy staging job i specify

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,440
the environment name and url where this

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,440
will be available

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,520
you can see i'm also requesting the

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,400
published token secret from github's

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,480
built-in encrypted secrets fault

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,600
after that job is completed we run our

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,039
smoke test

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:37,840
then a deployed production again

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:40,080
specifying the environment name and url

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,280
before calling the same action with

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,000
published token

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,880
as the secret now these steps are

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,880
identical

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,080
yet they publish to different places

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,679
that's because we define

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,200
a different publish token for each

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,760
environment let me show you how we do

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,159
this

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,120
i head into project settings then in the

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,919
new environment

00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:02,080
section i have staging and production

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,400
on the staging environment you can see

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,440
we have a published token defined

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,760
in github's encrypted secret vault even

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,320
as

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,320
admin i only have access to update this

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,799
i can't view it in the ui

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,960
going back to production i have the

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,720
production publish token defined in our

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,480
secrets here as well

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,159
but what's more interesting is that you

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,240
can see i've set this up to require

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,200
manual approval before code is deployed

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,880
to production

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,039
only people from this team can permit

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,360
code to go live and there's a full audit

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,840
trail to see who approved it

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,039
great staging's been deployed and our

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,120
smoke tests have run

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,799
let's take a quick look at the staging

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,120
environment

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,200
awesome looks good i'm going to enter my

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,480
id to test out my own graph and make

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,480
sure everything's working well

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,200
everything seems to be working well nate

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,559
has code is included

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,559
so i'm going to approve the release to

00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
production

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,440
back in the github ui i can click on

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,840
review deployments

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,600
select the environment and leave a quick

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:12,320
comment

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:14,400
approve the deploy there we go

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,159
deploying to production is underway

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,880
again with a different publish token

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,880
from staging

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:27,360
and with that we're deployed i'm going

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:30,720
to click the url just to validate

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,760
great head over to skyline.github.com if

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,600
you want to check out your own

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,280
contribution graph in 3d

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:39,919
back to you shanku thank you katie

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,039
so there we are a complete way to build

end to end

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,799
join a team get into the code make your

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,720
first contribution

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,720
get code reviewed with your peers with

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,120
the help of automated ci

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,880
to keep your code and your secrets and

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,840
your dependencies secure

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,520
and test and ship and celebrate together

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,000

on github's planet scale cloud now

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,159
software teams all across the world

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,559
are using github to do incredible things

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:14,640
one such story comes from india's own

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,280
infosys like our most visionary clients

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,960
partners

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,039
our goal is to become a completely

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,400
knowledge and data driven organization

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:24,080
with agility built into our core so that

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,440
we can sense all the business changes

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,159
happening around us

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,039
and continuously evolve in response at

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,799
infosys

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,640
we are envisioning ourselves to be a

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,840
live enterprise powered by our digital

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,080
platforms

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,280
our developers architects and

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,200
practitioners

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,520
are at the forefront of this leading it

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,720
for us and our endeavor is to enhance

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,880
their experience

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,799
make them highly effective and efficient

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,279
in everything that they are doing

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,520
our digital platforms for productivity

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:54,080
and the engineering tools ecosystem

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,159
allows us to do this at scale and drive

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,960
any change at the organization level

00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,679
in an accelerated manner our engineering

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,559
tools

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,880
and the continuously evolving ecosystem

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,720
of

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,640
home homegrown open source and

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,880
off-the-shelf tooling

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,679
forms an important cog in the wheel to

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,360
drive

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:16,640
agility and scale in a secured manner

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:20,080
for instance infosys devsecops platform

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,720
polycloud meridian leap modernization

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,720
suit

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,640
are some of the examples of assets that

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,400
power this for us

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,640
github is a critical element of this

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,400
ecosystem and is central to driving

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,760
developer productivity

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,440
secure sdlc inner sourcing reusability

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,400
and augmenting the developer analytics

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,799
for us it is unifying the experience of

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,600
of our developers by a variety of

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,400
integrations

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,480
around the robust devsecops ecosystem it

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,400
is also a key enabler for a live

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,320
enterprise store and marketplace

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,960
where we plan to bring together the

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,840
community of cloud builders on cobalt

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,320
from amongst our partners clients open

00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,279
source

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,200
academia and the startups to drive

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,159
contributions and consumption of various

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,400
assets

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,640
as well as enhance the ecosystem with an

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,320
open source first thinking

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,080
something i believe that any

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,159
forward-looking enterprise

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,480
engineering teams and developers would

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,240
appreciate in a big big way

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,880
as the github team continues to drive

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,559
the roadmap i look forward to seeing

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,240
several of the new capabilities around

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,799
security code scanning

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,320
telemetry observability analytics and

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,960
github actions

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:32,320
that can keep on taking us ahead in our

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,400
journey as a live enterprise

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,520
it is exciting to see what companies
