00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,640
i just want to take a moment to reflect

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,759
back over the course of the last

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,320
year and celebrate the growth energy

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,680
and passion of the developer community

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,079
in india

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,240
i can't believe that it was a year ago

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,479
that we launched in india and it's still

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,000
one of my favorite experiences since

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,000
joining github

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,759
as i told folks when i arrived back to

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,119
the u.s the positive

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,200
energy and drive here is palpable

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,399
it was such a thrill to get to be there

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,360
for our first

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,799
ever meet up in india and meet some of

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,439
our campus experts

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,240
hear from project maintainers and get to

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,159
know developers from across the country

00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,759
getting to meet up with folks in india

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,920
and learn about the work you were doing

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,240
was truly inspirational

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,240
and i could not be more thrilled to kick

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,479
off github satellite india

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,440
and celebrate the achievements and the

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,239
potential

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,480
of this thriving community i don't think

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,520
there's a question in anyone's minds

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,160
that india is an innovation powerhouse

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,280
and software is right at the center

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,760
there is so much

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,920
incredible engineering talent here that

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,000
we already have over 150 hovers in india

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,440
but the best part of all of this is that

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,560
it's brought us closer to

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,120

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,480
dreaming up and building solutions to

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,239
support remote voting

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,239
for indian citizens who are not

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,159
physically present in their registered

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,720
city on election day

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,000
thousands of india's best tech minds

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,480
came together to create

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,840
a technology solution to solve this

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,920
problem on github

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,760
and we're so proud of the work that is

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,959
still being done to support this

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,280
important effort

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,879
it's been an incredible year and that's

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,120
thanks to all of you

platform

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,239
every single day so let's take a quick

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,080
look at the last year in review

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,480
in the last year alone more than 1.8

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,080
million developers have joined github

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,120
the developer community in

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,400
india now totals 5.8

00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:00,319
million developers strong together

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,519
you've created 7.3 million repositories

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,080
in the last year

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,360
that's 81 percent more than the year

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,200
before

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,959
think of the potential of all of these

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,439
new projects

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,080
the number of contributions commits

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,280
issues

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,720
gifts prs team discussions increased by

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,199
75 percent

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,359
in india and that's compared to about 40

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,680
percent of the rest of the world

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,880
in public open source repositories

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,280
specifically

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,400
the number of contributors increased by

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,800
80 percent

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,080
over the previous year and most

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,120
strikingly

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,600
a million developers in india created

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,560
their first repository on github this

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,720
year

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,720
that's equivalent to a developer in

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,680
india creating their first repo on

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,960
github

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,040
every 30 seconds throughout the year a

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,320
million developers creating their first

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,160
repo

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,000
wow these numbers are incredible

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,720
the growth of the community here will

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,280
not only accelerate the indian economy

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,520
but have a lasting positive impact

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,759
across the world

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,680
all of these numbers mean that india is

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,479
the fastest growing country

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,639
in the world in terms of developers

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,120

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,519
that github has github has been doing

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,330
over the years

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,279
is it's been able to

00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:15,519
[Music]

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,279
think of developer workflows and how do

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,320
you end up optimizing

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,199
those workflows does and when i say

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,880
optimizing

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,199
bringing in the right kind of

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,480
automations which might be required

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:31,040
which ends up minimizing

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,639
interrupts that a developer typically

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,199
has to go through

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,000
there are certain repetitive tasks right

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,240
which

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,079
you would want to take off the plate of

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,440
an engineer

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,880
github actions enables us to plug in

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,240
various kinds of

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,600
linter tools that can actually help in

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,680
automating some of these uh you know

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,800
pr reviews for example that need to

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,560
happen and

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,639
at some point in time depending upon the

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,839
quality of that code

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:04,959
or to push into a build pipeline

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:08,240
thus optimizing our ci cd

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,480
having that much more time for the

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,199
engineers to focus on the real problems

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,439
while

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,799
the ones which are repetitive which a

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,959
lot of engineers see as

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,720
interrupts right being taken away from

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,880
them

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,880
i love hearing about the ways these

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,919
companies are using github to build

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,160
their business

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,480
and the way all of you are growing your

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,960
businesses on our platform

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,760
but of course most startups aren't

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,480
unicorns with thousands of developers

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,640
most consist of a few dedicated people

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,240
who are working hard to solve a problem

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,520
and make an impact

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,520
and like the unicorn these startups need

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,559
access to tools to help them work

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,960
efficiently

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,799
overcome challenges and attract the

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,720
right talent

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,160
we want to support these startups

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,799
whether they're early on in their

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,200
journey

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,880
or are taking off after finding product

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,960
market fit

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,520
last year along with our investment

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,520
partners we ran a pilot of a startup

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,480
program to offer github's full

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,720
enterprise platform to startups in india

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,160
the program was a huge success

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,320
with over 200 startups participating

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,200
those companies are doing incredible

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,679
things

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,840
cowispace is building a solution to

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,280
solve the geospatial requirements of

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,679
tech companies

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,799
clearquote is creating an ai led

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:31,440
automation app for vehicle inspections

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,280
and air meet is bringing people together

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,400
which is more important this year than

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,799
ever before

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,320
by providing a platform for hosting

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,200
virtual events

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,520
it is an honor to be just a tiny part in

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,600
the grow stories of these companies

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,600
and we know that there are so many more

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,679
exciting startups out there

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,600
that's why today i'm thrilled to

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,160
announce the expanded

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,720
github accelerate program which will

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,280
welcome

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,720
next year

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,200
these companies will get access to

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,320
nearly 2 million rupees worth

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,760

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,000
companies build when we look back on

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,440
them

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,240
a year from now speaking of innovation

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,400
and growth

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,559
at github we believe it's just as

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,880
important to support the next generation

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,240
of developers as it is to support the

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,320
current one

and we are fortunate to be partnering

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,400

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,120
the country

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,120
in the last year alone we've added more

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,280
than a hundred higher education

during our launch last year i was able

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,320
to have lunch with a few of these folks

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,120
and i was blown away by the energy and

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,720

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,679
supporting others in learning to use

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,520
github

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,039
and participating in the open source

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,360
