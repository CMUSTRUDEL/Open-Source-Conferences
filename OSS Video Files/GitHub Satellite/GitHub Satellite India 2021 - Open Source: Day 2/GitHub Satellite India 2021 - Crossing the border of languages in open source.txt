Title: GitHub Satellite India 2021 - Crossing the border of languages in open source
Publication date: 2021-03-28
Playlist: GitHub Satellite India 2021 - Open Source: Day 2
Description: 
	Presented by 
Richa Kumar, Sr. Director, Software Engineering @ GitHub
Kailash Nadh, CTO @ Zerodha
Nikhil Malhotra, Chief Innovation Officer @ Tech Mahindra

India is a land of many languages. While English is a common language for software development and open source, making open source more accessible to the non-English audience in India is important to advance the ecosystem. In this session, Richa Kumar from GitHub chats with the creators of two such projects—BHAML, an open source markup language for India, and Olam, an open source regional language dictionary—on the role of regional languages in open source, the challenges they faced in the development, and how other developers and contributors can make open source software more accessible to the masses.

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,760
thank you karan

00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,519
and hello everyone i am richard kumar

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,880
senior director for software engineering

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,880
here at github

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,080
and i have an amazing panel of speakers

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,119
with me who i'll introduce

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,760
in just a minute so platforms like

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,600
github

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,439
provide tools and capabilities for

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,640
developers anywhere in the world to

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,039
solve problems

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,519
learn from each other share their work

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,840
and collaborate towards common goals

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,040
today technology is at the heart of

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,680
everything

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,600
and access to technology is critical in

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,760
helping us solve problems and to

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,879
innovate in any area

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,879
that said if we think about it the

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,079
primary language in which developers are

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,280
able to work today

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,120
is english and access to majority of the

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,239
technical content and programming

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,800
frameworks

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,320
assumes that one is well versed with the

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,600
english language

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,239
so are we leaving out a vast majority of

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,239
people who do not fit this mold

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,840
if we really want to be able to reach

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,400
every aspiring developer

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,840
and idea generator in india or other

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,240
parts of the world

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,080
which have so many different languages

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,880
uh it's important for us that we

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,840
transcend

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,720
the language boundary luckily we have

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,799
with us today

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,479
two very accomplished people who have

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,119
been thinking about this problem

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,720
and are leading innovation in this space

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,520
so join me in welcoming

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,400

and creator of the bharat markup

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,680
language which is an open source markup

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,320
language for india

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,200

has what have been some of the

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,119
motivating factors for you

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,320
uh how do you see this problem space and

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,479
some of the ways that you have

00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,680
started tackling this so nikhil let's

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,520
start with you

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,960
uh tell us more about how you would

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,520
frame the problem that you're trying to

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,759
address

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,080
and also tell us a bit more about bharat

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,560
markup language

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,920
i sure richard um first of all thank you

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,920
so much to github um

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,680
i know this is an open forum in an open

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,599
community and then taking it forward to

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,400
this community is a is a great privilege

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,000
as well

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,920
i think the problems always been there

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,200
richard if you if you notice right the

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,319
90 percent

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,920
of us in india speak vernacular and we

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,160
are you know about 10 percent of us are

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,800
only well versed in english language

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,400
my inspiration comes from you know one

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,720
of the mentorship that i was doing with

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,800
the

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,840
utterly incubation centers with you know

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,400
a few of the kids

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,959
and this was a program called a student

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,040
innovator program or student to society

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,800
and we had students from both urban and

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,319
rural sectors and one of the

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,560
you know the teams that won was a rural

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,720
sector team from chhattisgarh

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,239
these four students used to walk about

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,120
45 kilometers

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,120
every day to go to school and you know

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,720
you call it scientific serendipity you

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,440
call it thought

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,480
they dropped in red amaranthus green

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,599
amaranthus and

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,280
some kind of bhajra on a piece of land

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,640
the wheat that grew out they actually

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,680
took juice out of it

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,519
and that particular jew started solving

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,200
a problem of malnutrition in that area

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,959
this project has been now

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,959
under the eyes of unicef and people are

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,200
looking at it so i was

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,640
amazed by the ingenuity and of course

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,680
there was a challenge to solve and these

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,280
guys were solving it

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,360
but then they came to us for mentorship

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,120
and we gave them mentorship regarding

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,360
how can you put it into a packaged

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,640
product how can you put it into seeds

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,159
format etc

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,840
but one of the students asked me sir i

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,159
want to learn technology but i don't

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,560
know

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,319
english so that was possibly the

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,720
starting point that got me thinking

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,319
about an

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,400
year back saying should india not have

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,920
the ability or should indian you know

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,840
indian kids not have the ability to

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,599
quote something in their own language

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,519
and that was the origination point of

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,519
bhamal or bharat markup language

00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,000
now what does brahmal do it's actually

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,000
open source it's available on bamal.org

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,680
people can go and have a look at it but

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,959
for the moment that we started off we

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,120
said that let kids is at least code html

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,280
by simple passing and transliteration in

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,280
their own language so we've given

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,280
12 languages for kids to code on it's

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,120
hindi marathi punjabi gujarati

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,120
and then we said that you know once we

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,519
go through this phase let kids try it

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,079
out

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,919
we will even go towards some more known

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,840
languages like javascript

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,680
like you know even scripting languages

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,000
that we could do so that we could give

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,800
that

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,479
kind of a layer of abstraction to kids

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,240
saying that now you should be able to

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:39,040
code in your own language

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:41,360
that's basically and our attempt

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,160
that's awesome uh uh nikhil it's great

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,320
to see the

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,919
the from where that you know motivation

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,880
started and where you've been able to

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,680
take it

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,080
um uh wonderful to hear about that uh

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,720
can

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,840
kailash what were the motivating factors

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,840
behind

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,440
the regional language dictionaries that

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,800
you have started i know this has been an

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,400
effort that's been going on for some

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,120
time but would love to hear

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,440
uh what kind of prompted you to do that

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,360
and what you feel has been the impact or

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,560
can continue to be the impact of some of

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,520
this work

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,240
so uh all in the first dictionary that

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,639
came out

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,919
uh came out 10 years ago almost 11 years

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,960
ago 2010

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,080
and it was born out of my personal

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,600
frustrations of

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,440
not being able to find a decent digital

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,000
malayalam dictionary

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,560
is my mother tongue that's what i speak

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,880
and

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,720
that uh pushed me down the rabbit hole

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,520
of figuring out how the landscape of

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,800
indian

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,759
online dictionaries and i realized uh

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,639
it was an abysmal landscape it wasn't

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,720
anything

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,919
and the few online dictionaries that

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,680
were available

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,840
they were riddled with ads you know the

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,639
quality wasn't great

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,880
the agenda was not really to run good

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,400
dictionaries for the public it was

00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:02,560
i think you know uh commerce

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,800
so i figured that there should be

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,960
an open data high quality dictionary

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,720
that is freely accessible to everyone

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,039
not just people looking at

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,840
definitions in a dictionary but research

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,919
students

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,360
anyone it should be open data and i

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,520
put together a dictionary with a few

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,880
thousand words that i entered myself

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,120
and i found a few

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,240
data sets small little datasets floating

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,400
around on the internet

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,160
unfortunately unattributed i put

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,560
everything uh scraped everything

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,199
everything together and built column it

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,479
was in english malayalam dictionary

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:41,600
and it went live in 2010

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,720
and today it's it's still it's still

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,759
available on

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,160
there's a mobile app i think uh

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,960
two to three million malayalam speakers

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,000
use it

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,840
every day so uh

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,080
that does prove that there is a great

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,720
need for open access open data

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,639
language dictionaries in all languages

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,560
so that's the story of poland

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:07,360
is a recent when i completely

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,319
randomly by happenstance came across v

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,400
krishna

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:15,039
who spent 40 years building a dictionary

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,440
which nobody really knew about and he

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,240
was uh gracious enough to open source it

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,360
so we took it

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,039
the biggest authoritative canada english

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,639
uh dictionary and it's it's

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,319
called allah now it's available again

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,080
openly directionally so

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,639
that's two big uh open data regional

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,639
dictionaries

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,120
nice nice uh great to hear about that uh

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,599
kailash

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,440
and just kind of opening this up to both

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,120
of you you know uh

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,280
what have been some of the challenges

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,639
that uh you know you all have faced as

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,599
you've sort of embarked on these

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,479
journeys

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,879
and um you know how have you uh you know

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,759
what

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,400
tools or approaches have you used to

00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,840
help you

00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,840
make progress you know

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,599
so i i'll take that question richard i

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,039
think uh the one of the biggest

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,759
challenges is of course lack of

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,440
awareness

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,360
and i think i would be very very open

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,720
saying that the moment you get into a

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,840
coding world

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,840
there is a kind of a predistant or a

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,199
kind of a predisposed notion that these

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,199
are the languages and this is something

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,599
that we've got to do

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,120
and that is something that i think

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,879
programs like github

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,319
we going on the open source channel

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,520
would really help us

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,840
take it forward number one number two um

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,560
a lot of people are not aware about the

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,959
strengths

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,919
of what local regional languages have

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,680
you know and and

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,360
and have been produced as well like

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,360
kalash really mentioned

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,680
that malayalam there's a there's a very

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,519
very valid dictionary that is now made

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,839
um you know my research started about

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,600
three years back on sanskrit as well and

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,839
and i found out that there's so much to

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,000
talk about natural language processing

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,839
right over there in that language even

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,800
though it may not be spoken

00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:01,200
very you know very openly it's only

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,000
spoken in small parts and small sectors

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,800
but sanskrit can give us that ability to

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,200
understand

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,800
the root of language as well as how the

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,839
natural language processing systems

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,480
could take place

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,279
um so you know if if there is awareness

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,360
then there is

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,279
there is a sort of uh you know the

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,440
people do understand what's the strength

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,560
what are we doing for it i think number

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,839
one uh

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,839
we i continue

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,080
to talk about it in all forms letting

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,680
people know

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,800
you know i continue to say i continue to

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,480
talk about what's going on with the

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
language how is sanskrit basically going

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,640
on

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,320
uh what should be the next step number

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,839
two is i've got some i've got a very

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,120
very good team that is also now taking

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,600
this language out to

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,120
to young kids and and even rule sectors

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,519
um

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,519
very interestingly i uh in my lab in

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,279
maker's lab there is a gentleman who was

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,680
earlier an uber driver

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,680
who actually learned over by the dent of

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,000
his hard work or whatever

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,959
python c c plus plus etc and he joined

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,519
the lab now

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,959
kovit pushed him to the to the villages

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,279
he's now in one of the villages in

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,720
maharashtra so he's taken upon himself

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,600
his name is satee she's taken upon

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,000
himself

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,519
he brings in students from about 30 40

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,120
odd school in the rural sector

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,560
and he starts teaching them harmal he

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,519
starts teaching them you know the coding

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,600
language itself

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,360
so that has been more of a generic

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,560
effort that we've been doing to raise

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,760
that awareness

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,000
there are of course other channels that

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,360
we are utilizing as marketing etc but uh

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,160
awareness is one of the biggest things

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,640
that we feel

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,200
is the challenge at this point in time

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,200
got it

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:36,480
right how about you kalash

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,519
i i completely agree uh and that

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,560
awareness also translates to

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,200
a significant lack of academic and

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,480
computing

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,160
language resources and i've cited this

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,560
example before

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,279
building if you want to do nobody thinks

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,640
twice about

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,800
english string search you know you do

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,519
control f you put your string in

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,440
and you know uh search happens there are

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,279
many different algorithms to do english

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,640
string search and

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,720
that's that's the case for latin

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,760
languages but

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,240
search for indig languages is

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,760
an understudied research area and

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,000
without academic research you can't

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,640
really build tools that people can use

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,399
so even to to get you know like simple

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,519
phonetic search working for the

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,680
dictionaries

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,200
uh i figured you know there was nothing

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,320
available so there was a lot of trial

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,720
and error

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,079
in a very non-academic sense to get that

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,640
fundamental string search

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,880
to work things have improved quite a bit

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,519
over the last 10 years

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,000
large there are large companies who

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,279
offer

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,800
free computing tools but it's definitely

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,279
awareness and i think the site

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,320
one of the side effects of language

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,560
input becoming

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,440
prevalent across mobile devices

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,320
everywhere is

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,839
i think people assume that the indic

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,680
language problem is solved because you

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,279
can read your language on the phone

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,560
you can write your language on the

00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,240
keyboard but in fact the fact that

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,079
language keyboards are now standard on

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,839
all indian operating systems was in fact

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,639
a community push that happened five six

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,480
years ago

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:10,160
if it wasn't for that you know uh like a

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,680
open source group pushing for that to be

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,000
established it wasn't for that i don't

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,279
think we'd have standard input tools

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,480
so there's an acute lack of

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,480
awareness especially among i think

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,839
amongst engineering folks also people

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,320
assume the language problem is solved

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,600
but

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,360
when it comes to index languages we

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,360
haven't even scratched the surface

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,360
makes sense i think what i'm hearing

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,200
from you is that you know there have

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,639
been some recent pushes which have i

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,560
think which have helped the

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:48,160
end consumers to be able to um

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,480
you know see a lot of content or

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,160
apps in their language of choice but

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,680
when it comes to really enabling the

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,360
creators

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,680
right we're still we still have a long

00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,000
way to go because of the lack of the

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,279
content the lack of the

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,920
tools frameworks uh which primarily

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,399
uh work with english today and so i

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,320
think

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,680
the work that both of you are doing is

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,160
is really going to help

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,920
and uh you know take us a little bit

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,800
forward on that path

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,560
and you talked about you know technical

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,600
challenges around string search and

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,680
things like that

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,120
and and both of you will probably have

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,279
insights into this so

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,880
how does that like you know is that um

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:30,399
you know especially as you worked on

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,760
two different languages dictionaries um

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,519
are there patterns that that can scale

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,680
out to other languages

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,600
is it every time you're adding support

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,600
for a new language are you kind of are

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,600
we starting from scratch

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,120
uh you know how maybe you can give us a

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,240
little insight into um

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,839
you know how how how much effort

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,600
is involved and what are some of the

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:56,000
ways that people could

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,000
contribute uh you know along this effort

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,240
no absolutely richard i think digital

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,160
content and content except

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,440
remains a challenge as kailash rightly

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,760
mentioned and i think

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,600
my area has been to find the middle

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,160
layer for sanskrit as well

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,079
and i'm finding some patterns um you

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,920
know wherever we

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,440
as of languages across the across the

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,079
subcontinent there are different

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,839
patterns

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,240
but then again these patterns need to be

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,079
adjusted to that specific language now

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,079
um just to give you an example a lot of

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,160
people and and that's where

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,120
if i may talk to the community in terms

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,839
of um

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,399
what has been the genius that panini was

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,959
and i think

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,880
panani's genius was to understand where

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,760
exactly is information encoded in our

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,079
language so

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,600
um how much of that information is

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,760
encoded and what is there

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,760
exactly which needs to be grabbed up if

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,160
you want to talk about that language now

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,240
um

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,160
considering simple simple words like the

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,000
bands going to the village i think

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,480
all of us a lot of you are viewers would

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,240
know that in sanskrit it translates to

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:58,240
purusha gramma the problem is that

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,519
if i replace the order of the words in

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,000
english for example

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,800
village go man the meaning completely

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,720
changes

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,320
in sanskrit because of inflection the

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,440
meaning remains the same

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,160
so what and panani's genius was to

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,680
actually say

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,199
where exactly is this information

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,199
included it's not in the

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,120
purusha it's not in the grammar it's

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,880
actually in the t of gachati

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,959
where exactly it makes that verb

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,320
available this

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:27,519
specific construct and this specific

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,199
rule applies to almost all sectors of

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,079
indict languages they may be different

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,759
here and there

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,279
but if you look at the pattern in which

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,440
we speak and the way

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,440
the languages have been handed over this

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,120
particular pattern applies to all there

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,120
are certain other patterns which don't

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,639
but the research has been on in

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,279
different sectors i've seen

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,800
colleges we've been we've seen academia

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,360
work on it we've seen researchers work

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,519
on it

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,519
but there are some very very good

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,240
patterns to help us in natural language

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,920
processing

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,759
which we are finding within indic

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,160
languages and that's been a revelation

00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,759
so

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,600
i think if more and more people join

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,560
this community of open source they would

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,320
find that

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,759
these patterns would also help them

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,680
solve some of the challenges for natural

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,639
language processing in english as well

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,720
so that's what we're finding out very

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,800
interesting

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:17,120
got it yeah i agree indeed languages

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,120
share

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,000
so yeah indeed languages share quite a

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,360
bit in common and

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,160
research research developed for one

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,000
language

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,199
i think there's a significant overlap

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,680
with what you could use for other

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:36,320
languages to cite a concrete example

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:38,560
for the malayalam dictionary to work uh

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,240
i had to i ended up putting metaphor

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,040
which is an english phonetic

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,720
hashing algorithm really simple you uh

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,800
you take a word elephant apple

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,839
it'll encode it to you know two or three

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,279
letters like apl or

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,959
ebnt so the idea is that similar

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,720
sounding words will all hatch to the

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,320
same set of strengths

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,759
it's called metaphor it's available in

00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,120
the public domain so that was important

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,519
for malayalam

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,680
and uh that's how phonetic search from

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,600
that malayalam dictionary works

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:10,480
but because the phonetic nature of

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,120
kannada is extremely similar and for

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,839
that matter you know in the gujarati etc

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,400
this was easily voted overnight to

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,240
kannada

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,760
and we certainly have canada phonetic

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,480
search on color

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,000
so a lot of things that we develop for

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,079
one indict language can be

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,120
outright applied with very minor tweaks

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,480
and exceptions

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,480
for many other languages the and

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,480
like you said uh i wanted to add one

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,799
thing to what you said earlier there is

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,919
widespread availability of tools like

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,919
for example there is

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,440
google translate for almost all major

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,000
indic languages today

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,640
and there's google input tools but these

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,320
are all

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,400
unfortunately proprietary how these

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,160
tools work we don't know

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,440
what are the algorithms that power these

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,480
tools we don't know what are the data

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,120
since they go into it

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,480
we don't know so if that tool disappears

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,280
one day millions of users will be

00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,960
handicapped

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,039
that's why it's important for language

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,080
related research and

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:06,960
data to all come out in the public

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:10,240
domain and be open source

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:14,640
yeah make sense make sense and so

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,679
uh how would you uh if i ask both of you

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,720
that you know if

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,919
our um open source community would want

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,120
to contribute on this

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:26,880
front uh both uh

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:30,720
specifically on your projects as well as

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,200
uh you know how should they be keeping

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,400
all of this in mind in their own efforts

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:43,840
you know any

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:43,840
any advice for the folks listening in

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:52,160
i think uh i'll go first

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,520
so uh all the all the components that

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,960
have gone into building these

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,120
dictionaries in english

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,000
the data sets themselves part of speech

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,880
tagged

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,360
and the software that runs the website

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,039
the

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,280
phonetic algorithms and power source

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,960
these are all open source and they're

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,960
all available on github

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,720
so for someone wanting to start to do

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,960
simple things especially surrounding

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:20,320
open data and dictionaries they could

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,919
think of it you know the data they could

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,440
think of with the code they could even

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,080
use some of these tools to build their

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,480
own little

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,280
local dictionaries for example you could

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,240
very easily

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,880
with minimal effort build a hindi

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,039
technical

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,080
word dictionary it could be 5000 or 10

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,160
000 words

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,000
so or even a couple thousand words but

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,840
you know technical you know scientific

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,720
mathematical world so even small efforts

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,720
like that building

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,080
niche open data dictionaries for

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,200
different languages would be a great

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,640
start so

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,400
there are many things one could do

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,840
without actually getting into proper

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,840
linguistic research

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,280
no i agree with i think i think i'm

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,000
sorry just to just to add to one point

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,760
over here

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,600
i think one of the things is for people

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,240
to actually go and use these projects i

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,240
think

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,159
download them fork them find out what

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,200
are some of the things that is going on

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,760
um and maybe add on top of it um and

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,440
and figure out what's the base value at

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,880
what that is being created and i think

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,880
the moment you add more

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,000
uh the moment you learn more as well

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,600
understanding what's going on

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,600
and you would go into your own research

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,440
smaller research on the side as well

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,600
yeah

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,919
make sense and uh nikhil one thing i

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,200
wanted to touch upon was that as you

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:36,320
as we think about um making uh

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,720
you know uh programming uh

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,240
or technology more accessible to

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,280
non-english speakers

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,720
uh do we see it as uh

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,559
you know like what you're trying to do

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,480
with bharmal where you're enabling

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,919
them to use the language that they are

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,440
familiar with and then

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:55,200
i guess translating so that the current

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,120
tools that work with english can

00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,159
continue to work

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,720
do you see it continuing in that form do

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,679
you see

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,440
us do you see this do you see other

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,080
strategies where we use

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,159
no code and low code kind of things and

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,039
more natural language processing which

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,919
does code generation uh or are there

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,080
even other

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,720
strategies to you know make this more

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,720
accessible

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,919
now you're absolutely right richard i

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,919
think it's a mixture of both it's both

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,679
translation it's both transliteration

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,799
but it's also about looking at natural

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,880
language processing

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,960
but i think my vision the vision that i

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,600
carry within india is that at the end of

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,640
the day

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,440
on silicon it's just so

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,559
what we've got to do is basically do the

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,960
layer

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,720
and change that entire layer so whether

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,000
it's the layer of compilers it's the

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,640
layer of assembler

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,080
it's even the layer of the os that

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,600
should essentially be changed to

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,559
understand the language in its most

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,280
prime form

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,200
if that happens you can put that as an

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,200
os addendum on anything it could be a

00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,000
version of linux it could be freebsd or

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,240
whatever

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,080
but that will really change the impact

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,039
of a language and the usage of that

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,080
language as well

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:08,480
so while we all say that c is the mother

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,240
or the foundation of all in or you know

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,400
all programming languages

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,440
could we develop another language which

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,280
is like c

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,960
but it's basically based out of all of

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,440
these regional language structures as

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,120
well

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,400
uh could it have a completely different

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,000
structure could it have a completely

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,000
different database structure as well

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,159
so i think those components is something

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,960
which is basically driving this vision

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,480
this work is very very primitive what

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,880
you know and i would like to call my

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,880
work

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,400
i'm not privy to actually say what

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,919
kailash is doing but it's very very

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,559
primitive it's actually scratching the

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,480
surface

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,640
but the open source community now has

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,880
the ability to actually take this

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,320
forward and bring it out in a much more

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,039
bigger and brighter way

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,240
um you know change the layers the osi

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,760
layers as you call it

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,039
and that will really produce the change

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:57,039
for the index sector as well

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,440
makes sense and uh what do both of you

00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,919
think

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,039
in terms of you know the overall role

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,000
that open source

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:08,640
uh plays uh in regards to computer

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,919
literacy in india

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,919
uh i think

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,559
as i said earlier they're having

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,760
considerable

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:22,080
uh interventions and activism

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,960
and pushes from the open source language

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,240
computing

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:29,120
community all volunteer based in india

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,960
which we don't really see on the surface

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,840
and thanks to which by most indict

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,039
languages today

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,600
are properly standardized unicode

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,799
there are bi standards managing but all

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,360
should have

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,320
uh indig languages so the open source

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,880
communities are

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,760
what really gave us the indic digital

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,679
you know computing

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,960
language revolution we don't see it

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,480
because we only interface with uh

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,400
the consumer devices and you know

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,159
consumer software so

00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:01,440
i i would say that the question

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,279
how can open source help is moved in the

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,279
face of open source is what really gave

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:08,080
us you know this

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,679
this indic languages uh in the digital

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,720
form to begin with

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,960
and going forward also as i said you

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,520
know

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,640
could be simple algorithms could be open

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,640
data sets

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,720
all these building blocks they have to

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,559
be in the public domain for

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,960
true innovation and accessibility to

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,480
happen you can't really build

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,240
if you if you end up building a great

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,440
language translation model and you keep

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,760
it proprietary

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,960
you're holding language hostage from a

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,159
large part of the

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,159
population and

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,000
and everything is going online

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,960
especially critical government public

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
services

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,440
so it's important that all these

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,600
critical public services that are going

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,240
online are accessible in local languages

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,159
too

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,159
for that you need great you know

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,440
publicly accessible open

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:57,600
building blocks so foss is uh

00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:02,240
highly intertwined and ingrained in this

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:05,120
whole you know moment

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,279
absolutely absolutely nikhil anything

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,120
you'd like to add there

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:12,320
no i think i i think kalasha's pretty

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,320
much covered everything i think the only

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,000
and i think the reason is for everyone

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,960
to see i think the reason we are having

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,039
and discussing this

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,960
today on a github satellite is the

00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,799
reason enough for us to say that this is

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,400
the power of open source community

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,200
and that power of open source community

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:30,000
can actually be factored in yeah so

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,080
makes sense and i think uh just uh

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,679
touching back on the example that you

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,200
started with nikhil at the beginning of

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,799
our discussion where you know you talked

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,440
about these kids who

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,159
had really come upon this great idea and

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,120
uh that

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,799
helped solve malnutrition and really for

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,400
them to take that idea

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:50,640
and you know reach a lot more people and

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,000
make a bigger impact really it's

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,919
technology that's going to hold them

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,320
back if they don't get access to it

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,440
and so uh you know that was a great way

00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,919
to see that uh

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,720
if we really want to reach out to all

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,679
those

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,919
uh folks um that are coming up with

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,120
these innovative ideas and really

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,880
empower them

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:14,039
uh raising that awareness amongst uh

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,159
you know both open source community

00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:17,279
corporations uh everyone has to come

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,480
together and see

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,039
what we all can do uh in this area to

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,360
really

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,760
truly make this uh technology accessible

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,039
to

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,919
everyone so it's been wonderful talking

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,600
to both of you

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,799
uh it's really um fascinating to hear

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,200
about the work

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,480
that you all have been doing i am very

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,159
very excited

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,679
about the possibilities that are ahead

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,720
of us um and

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,120
uh i hope that both at github and all uh

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,080
you know

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,000
our amazing uh open source community

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,200
that we're gonna take away some uh

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
important uh you know um thoughts back

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,720
from this

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,919
and you know as we do our own work uh

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,240
we'll be looking at

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,360
how we can make everything that we do

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,720
more accessible

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,320
and empower more people across the world

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,400
thank you both it's been a pleasure

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:12,640
talking to you today

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,640
