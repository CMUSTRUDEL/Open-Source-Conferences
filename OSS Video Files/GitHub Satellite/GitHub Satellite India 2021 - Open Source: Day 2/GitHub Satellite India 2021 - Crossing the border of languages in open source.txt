India is a land of many languages. While English is a common language for software development and open source, making open source more accessible to the non-English audience in India is important to advance the ecosystem. In this session, Richa Kumar from GitHub chats with the creators of two such projects—BHAML, an open source markup language for India, and Olam, an open source regional language dictionary—on the role of regional languages in open source, the challenges they faced in the development, and how other developers and contributors can make open source software more accessible to the masses.
