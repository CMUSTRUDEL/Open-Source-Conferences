world

00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,240

00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,440
of the community here has been

00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:01,760
incredible in the last year 1.8 million

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,520
developers have joined github from india

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,160
and over a million developers have

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:09,040
created their first repo on github

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,160
india has now become the fastest growing

00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,920
country in the world

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,320
in terms of developers contributing to

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,480
open source that is amazing

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,480
erica has also announced a new set of

00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,760
github programs in india that we're very

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,440
excited about

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,440
the github grants for open source

00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,680
program which will provide

00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,800
10 million rupees of grants to open

00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,200
source projects

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,480
based here in india the github

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,000
accelerate program

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,400
which will partner with startup

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,400
accelerators and the indian government

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,320
to expand support to over a thousand

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,160
startups with our complete platform

00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,680
and finally the github externship

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,440
program for students

00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,280
which will provide participating

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,320
students a chance to get real-world

00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,800
experience

00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,960
working with software companies and

00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,520
we're really thrilled to see what you

00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,400
are accomplishing with github here in

00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,640
india

00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,440
this community is poised to double in

00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,440
the next

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,079
two years and we're excited to see what

00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,839
you will build with github next

00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,359
now github is the world's largest

00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:08,000
developer community

00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,520
and it is for a purpose and that purpose

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,599
is to build together

00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,680
we think of software development as the

00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,760
world's largest team sport

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,960
and we believe that it is a sport

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,359
without borders

00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,000
now i was born in india and i moved to

00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,839
canada

00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,760
when i was young to study computer

00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,800
science and i had to move again to the

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,480
united states

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,000
to take advantage of the best

00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,920
opportunities in tech

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,760
that was the reality back then right if

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,599
you wanted an opportunity you had to

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,920
move to go find it

00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,520
remote learning remote work global

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,119
companies these were all concepts that

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,760
were unheard of

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,640
but today it is possible for a team of

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,800
strangers

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,040
to come together from across the world

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,359
and build incredible things together

00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,320
and this is what we see on github every

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,800
single day

00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,640
collaborations and contributions from

00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,440
developers all over the world

00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,640
in real time and it's also increasingly

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,800
the reality at work

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,119
teams of all shapes and sizes companies

00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,359
from all over the world are going remote

00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,040
and they're going worldwide to tap into

00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,680
the best developers whether they come

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,720
from

00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:13,040
mumbai or mombasa or miami

00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,079
and those developers need to be able to

00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,640
work together

00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,400
on projects from wherever they are

00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,200
that's what i love about github github

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,440
was built for this kind of collaboration

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,880
so today i want to take you on a tour

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,000
through github's products

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:31,119
and show you how you can use them to

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,040
build from wherever you are now

00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,440
do you remember your first time joining

00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,040
a software team i know i do that thrill

00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,079
of writing code and committing it for

00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,000
the first time

00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,359
and seeing it in a product right but

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,320
first there were all those things you

00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,720
had to go through

00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,680
right setting up your dev box setting up

00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,280
your tools

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,599
getting your code and looking through it

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,240
to learn going through docs and style

00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,599
guides

00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,440
all of those things that you had to

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,920
learn before you can contribute

00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,560
something

00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,359
without messing it up even with the best

00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,079
mentor

00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:02,400
to help you that could take days and the

00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,280
reality is today you have to do that all

00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,680
the time

00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,319
developers almost never work on just one

00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,240
thing

00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:10,160
you're always having to switch context

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,560
work on different projects

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,079
fixing live site incidents contributing

00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,319
to other teams code

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,359
or even just learning something new that

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:21,040
is not easy

00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:22,400
on average it takes over 23 minutes to

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,640
switch context

00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,240
and get into the flow and that is if

00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,839
you've got everything set up for you

00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,040
often it can take a lot longer

00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:33,200
so github we care about this a lot we

00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,760
want developers to be able to get into

00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,920
the flow

00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,520
get into the code and contribute whether

00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,079
they're joining a project for the first

00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,760
time

00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,200
or just getting back into it after a

00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,000
while to show you

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,760
how github helps you get in the flow

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,280
here's neha

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,800
hi i'm neha i'm the director of

00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,400
engineering here at github for the team

00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,760
that works on discussions

00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,680
i'm pleased to announce that we've now

00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,200
enabled discussions on private repos and

00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,960
that means for this private repo

00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,720
we can have our team conversations here

00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,359
and leave our issues for tracking our

00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,800
work

00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,800
here we have some internal chat about

00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,160
skylines these cool 3d printed

00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,079
contribution graphs that people have

00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,000
created using a website we built but we

00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,280
also use discussions to talk about ideas

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
in the team and with others in the

00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,079
company

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,839
my teammate diana had an idea here the

00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,440
other day about adding a year selector

00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,440
to the page and i really like that

00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,720
so i want us to work on this so let's

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,000
create an issue from this discussion

00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,359
thread and track the work

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,599
so i'm just going to go in here

00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:25,200
reference the issue give it a title

00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,720
and then i can just scroll down and i

00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,319
can create the issue

00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,680
so this shouldn't be too hard and i'm

00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,119
thinking i might be the one to pick this

00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,960
up and so we can do it together

00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,319
let's just take a quick look so i'm

00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,440
going to go over i'm going to assign the

00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,200
issue to myself

00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,720
and you can see that this isn't the code

00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,599
base that i work in every day this is

00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,359
just for fun

00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,119
so rather than downloading all the

00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,560
dependencies to my machine and getting a

00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,280
full development environment set up

00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,520
locally

00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,520
i can open a code space right here in

00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,280
github and i can get my own personal dev

00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,359
box in the cloud right away

00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,800
and this isn't just running the visual

00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,400
code editor in the cloud

00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,240
this is a full-blown personal

00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,480
development environment in the cloud

00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:03,040
so for example if i like go over to the

00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,000
terminal and i type in npm run dev here

00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,480
in the console

00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,280
i can get the full local development and

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,200
experience

00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,480
as if i'd had the code locally on my

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,400
machine

00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,000
code spaces even sees when my code is

00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,319
running a server on localhost

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,040
and so it'll let me connect to it across

00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,040
the internet

00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,960
taking care of all of the htgps

00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,160
tunneling and authentication to ensure

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,760
only i can see

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,560
what is running on my dev box in the

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:29,119
cloud so let me type in my github id

00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,240
nerd neha and let me check out this

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,680
awesome graph

00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,000
so this site's pretty awesome it's got

00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,079
like a nice soundtrack and the coolest

00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,960
part is it's running on my dev box in

00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,440
the cloud

00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,000
but yeah 2020 isn't really a year i want

00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,839
to remember

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,760
so let's get started on that issue that

00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,280
diana mentioned by adding a year

00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,040
selector here

00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,319
code spaces is already authenticated

00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,160
with github so actually

00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:51,680
i can actually just go to the github

00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,800
extension in vs code

00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,480
and it has my issues already listed so

00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,440
if i click on it you can see the issues

00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,880
listed here

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,280
i'm going to find the issue that i

00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,640
created and start working on my issue

00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,160
and you can see that it's already

00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,280
created a new feature branch for me to

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,119
add my changes

00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,040
so all i have to do now is take a look

00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:11,440
at the files so i'm going to go over

00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,760
i'm going to find the form part which i

00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,280
happen to know is called hero.view

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,880
and i know that the code that i want to

00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,599
add in is between the at symbol and the

00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,200
submit button

00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,960
so i'm going to quickly add the code for

00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,640
your selector and then i'm going to hit

00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,400
save

00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,079
now this is a full development

00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,119
environment so if i just jump back into

00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,040
my application

00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,560
we can see it's refreshing just as if i

00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,400
was running code locally

00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,680
and it'll start to bring up the selector

00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,359
there it is so

00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,040
i'm going to type in my username again

00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,520
and i'm going to test it with the 2018

00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,880
year

00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,040
i know that i had like a pretty good

00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,240
year that year um and also i had this

00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,200
like great break for summer and

00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,079
thanksgiving

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,040
so i want to see if those show up uh and

00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,920
so

00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,720
here we go okay so you can see my

00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,640
skyline

00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,079
and you can see that like i even at the

00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,520
end there's like some nice gaps it's

00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,240
when i took my end of year vacation

00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,680
super seriously um and so this is all

00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,119
running in my private development

00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,800
machine in the cloud

00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,400
um i can come in i can mess with the

00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,160
graph i can scroll around

00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,440
and so i know that this works and i'm

00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,640
ready let's commit this

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,040
and let's share the changes with the

00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,400
team so what i want to do now is i want

00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,000
to go back to my editor

00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,079
and i want to first commit that change

00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,800
locally so i'm going to go into the get

00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,319
view

00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,599
um and you can notice it already

00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,560
includes a link to the issue that we're

00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,960
working on

00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,760
and so um then i can go ahead i can

00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,960
commit it

00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,480
and now i'm going to create a pull

00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,000
request so i can do that by going

00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,440
straight to the extension

00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,520
um and then i'm going to go into my

00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,960
github view i'm going to create a new

00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,640
pull request it's going to figure out

00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,480
which branch i want to compare to

00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,920
and it's going to even publish the

00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,599
branch for me so

00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,760
i'm just going to scroll down here hit

00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,280
create and then i can create the pull

00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,880
request and it's going to do all of the

00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,480
work of publishing the branch

00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,000
pushing the changes in the server and

00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,640
even creating the pull request in the

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,240
server

00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,280
so you can see my pr it's like right

00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:55,440
here so if i go back into my repo

00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,280
on github i can navigate over to the

00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,040
pull request tab so let's do that really

00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,319
quickly

00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:04,640
and there you can see my pr is available

00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:06,000
uh your selector for graph and you can

00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,800
see that it's ready for my team to

00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,319
review

00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,319
and i can see that the ci builds have

00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:12,880
already kicked off so i can

00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:14,720
to verify my change so let me go in i'm

00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,440
gonna tag this with the enhancement

00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,440
label

00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,119
and then i'm gonna you make use of this

00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,240
super cool new feature it's called auto

00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,560
merge and github

00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:24,720
and so what i'm doing here is i'm having

00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,079
the pr get merged automatically as soon

00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,839
as all the checks are complete

00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,359
and the code has been reviewed by the

00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,839
team and so i don't have to do anything

00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,440
here

00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:33,200
and this leaves me free to get on with

00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,240
my next change in the meantime let me

00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,240
hand you back to shanku

00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:40,400
thanks neja now once you've written your

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,160
code

00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,560
it's time to get it reviewed and

00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,160
committed now code reviews have also

00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,000
changed in this new world

00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,920
used to be that you could invite someone

00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,440
over to look over your shoulder

00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,599
review your changes and give you a quick

00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,079
thumbs up but now that you're working on

00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:58,079
a distributed or remote team

00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:59,680
you still need that review you just need

00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:02,640
new ways to do it

00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,800
now on github everything about code

00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:07,040
revolves around the pull request

00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,200
and the code review experience pull

00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,079
requests were designed to let strangers

00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,040
review

00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,000
and collaborate and commit code together

00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,920
during the last year

00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,359
as teams have become more remote we've

00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,160
seen something amazing

00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:21,680
on github developers are actually

00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,400
submitting pull requests for code

00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,720
reviews

00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,880
more often than ever before as much as

00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,359
30 percent more frequently

00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,839
and when they do those pull requests are

00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:33,839
getting reviewed faster than ever before

00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:35,599
and that's good news if your prs are

00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:37,680
more frequent and smaller

00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,440
they're easier to review and that leads

00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,680
to higher quality code reviews

00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,800
and higher quality code and when they're

00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,880
easier to review

00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,839
they also get reviewed faster which

00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,280
means that they get

00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:51,680
committed faster and shipped faster

00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,960
better prs also means not just having

00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,160
human helpers

00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:58,960
but the bots github actions

00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:01,119
and our amazing ecosystem provides an

00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,560
integrated ci platform with thousands of

00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,240
custom actions

00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:06,319
written by our community that can

00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,960
automate all sorts of reviews

00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:10,319
running your unit tests applying linters

00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,240
and style guides

00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:14,079
checking your dependencies and just

00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:17,520
helping you commit better code

00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:18,960
to show us more here is a tool i'm atul

00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,920
and i work on the databases team here in

00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,520
hazard bar

00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,119
this is the pr from neha where she has

00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,240
added a new ear selector to the site

00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,839
that we're building

00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,200
for every change we make to the site we

00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,400
build and test it automatically using

00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,839
data actions

00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,079
let me show you the ci bill for neha's

00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:33,359
latest changes if i go into the summary

00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,280
view you can see the brand new

00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,800
visualizer showing us running the build

00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,359
and test steps on both mac and linux

00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,280
machines

00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:41,040
all at the same time this takes

00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,240
advantage of data actions and our hosted

00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,800
build runners which provide you with

00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,200
secure

00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,079
build servers on demand all of this

00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,319
infrastructure is

00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,680
managed for you by our team at github so

00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,640
that you can add new build machines

00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,960
whenever you need them

00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,400
for either linux windows or the mac

00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,520
let's go back let's look at how the

00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,280
build is configured

00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,880
our workflows are defined in the dark

00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,319
data folder under workflows

00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,599
we are going to look at the ci build

00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:05,119
first we can see that it is triggered by

00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,480
new changes in the main branch but also

00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,839
by any pull requests that are targeting

00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,520
the main branch

00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,960
we also define which operating system

00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,720
and node versions we want to run our

00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,240
build on and then we build our code

00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,640
from the lender and do a full test

00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,760
should pass the actions community is

00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,599
fantastic

00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,800
with over 7000 open source actions in

00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,800
the marketplace

00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,319
in the ci build we have added an awesome

00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,160
community action from tim lucas and

00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,359
joseph peterson that will update draft

00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,520
release note for you

00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:31,119
based on your issues and full requests

00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,319
so that's that's the power of community

00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:34,800
for you

00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:36,800
that you can use to transfer ci we also

00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,599
create and deploy a test environment in

00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,200
the cloud for every single pull request

00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,960
this makes it easy for us to review the

00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,800
changes in a working environment

00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,319
so let's take a look at the dev test

00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,000
development workflow which is run in

00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:49,280
parallel alongside our ci bit so as you

00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,640
saw this is triggered by

00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,720
pushes to main along with new pull

00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,240
request we come in get the code and then

00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,839
deploy it to our cloud provider using a

00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,480
secret which we store securely inside

00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:59,040
github's

00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,800
built-in secret store we've also added a

00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,000
job to this workflow that will come back

00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,920
and destroy the environment when the

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,559
pull request is closed to keep our costs

00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,680
down

00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:09,680
so let's go back to the pr from the pr

00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:12,960
from neha and review it

00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:14,640
um let's scroll down i can see the link

00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,960
a link that has been added by the

00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,400
deployment so i can click on that and

00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,119
quickly test the changes without having

00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,880
to install anything myself

00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,480
i can see that the new here selector is

00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,680
there so let's just enter a name

00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:29,839
and selector here 2018 and then take a

00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:33,760
look at the graph

00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:33,760
the graph is loading

00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:40,240
and yeah i think the

00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,920
contribution block looks good it has the

00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,520
ear as well so i think the ear selector

00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,280
is working you're able to select the ear

00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,960
as well as

00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,559
see it on the contribution graph so

00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,680
let's go back to the pr

00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:51,680
and let's review the code

00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:58,319
the code the code looks good so let's

00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:00,800
just say lgtm and

00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:02,400
quickly approve the code now because

00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,160
they has enabled auto merge

00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,920
s1 has approved the change the code is

00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,440
deployed the code is merged

00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,119
automatically and data actions take care

00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,079
of destroying the test environment for

00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,800
me

00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:14,800
so everything just works into it back to

00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:18,400
shangri

00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:19,839
thank you now by using github pull

00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,559
requests and actions

00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:23,599
we are seeing our customers ship code to

00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,160
production

00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,720
way more often but it's not just enough

00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:29,359
to ship

00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,480
faster you also have to ship safely and

00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,880
securely

00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,839
one leaked secret one vulnerable piece

00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,240
of code

00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:37,119
one insecure dependency can cost you

00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,599
time

00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,480
cost you money and cost your customers

00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,240
trust

00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,319
now we're humans and humans make

00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,160
mistakes it turns out

00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:47,839
the majority of security vulnerabilities

00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,000
are just human mistakes

00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:51,599
and once those mistakes get into code

00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,520
they're hard to get out

00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,920
so if you can fix those mistakes before

00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:58,559
you ship or even before you commit code

00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,240
that's great and if you can't then the

00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,760
quicker you can fix them once they're

00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,079
found the better

00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,520
so with github security tools we're

00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,000
trying to put security

00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:10,079
where it makes the most sense right into

00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,559
the developer workflow

00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,680
so you can find and fix these issues

00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:17,680
more quickly

00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:19,520
so to show us more here is niroshan

00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,119
hello everyone my name is niroshan

00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,280
rajadheri and i'm part of the

00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,160
application security field team here at

00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,599
github

00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,880
and i'm going to talk to you about the

00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:29,359
work we've been doing in this space

00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,680
through a quick demonstration

00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:34,240
in our example here we have advanced

00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:36,160
security enabled in our organization

00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,839
and this allows us to easily switch on

00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,440
code scanning and secret scanning for

00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:41,200
our private repos

00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,240
but everyone can still use these

00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:45,839
features on your public repos for free

00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:48,400
just go to the security section of your

00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:50,319
repo settings and switch it on there

00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,000
i can get an overview of the security

00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:54,400
situation for my project from the

00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,480
security tab in the repo

00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,559
beginning with supply chain issues here

00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,079
we have dependebot enabled

00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,079
it is automatically looking for

00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:04,000
vulnerabilities with my dependencies and

00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:06,960
it will create a pull request for me

00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,440
if one of them needs updating looking

00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,440
here

00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,640
i see dependable is telling me about a

00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,119
new release of

00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,800
one of the actions that atoll was using

00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:16,720
it's a minor revision so i'm going to go

00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,720
ahead and approve this change to keep us

00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,480
up to date

00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,400
all the tests are passing so i'm going

00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,480
to go ahead and merge this change

00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,800
now even our build processes can be kept

00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,040
up to date with dependerbot

00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:31,280
back to the security tab i see that

00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:34,000
secret scanning is also active

00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,920
let's take a look to see if any of my

00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,400
team accidentally checked in secrets or

00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,480
api

00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,079
tokens so we can stop them from being

00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,839
externalized

00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,680
if we look at the closed issues we can

00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:44,400
see one of my developers accidentally

00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,880
checked in

00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,319
code that included a token in the past

00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,720
so we've actually revoked that and

00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:52,480
removed it from the code

00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,160
so that's known vulnerabilities and

00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,599
sequence taken care of

00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:58,640
but what about our unknown

00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:00,720
vulnerabilities with codeql from github

00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,400
we're able to scan our code base looking

00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,480
for code which could be introducing

00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,400
potential security vulnerabilities into

00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,400
the code that we're writing

00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,960
as you can see it's identified one here

00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,200
for me i can show the code part that was

00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,119
found with code queues analysis tools

00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,720
and i can see that this is definitely an

00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:18,559
issue however

00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:21,040
it doesn't look like it'll lead to a

00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:22,720
major exploit in our case

00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,040
but let's create a quick issue from the

00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:26,720
code so we don't forget about it

00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,800
this should be a simple fix to

00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,000
explicitly tostring the value from the

00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,920
url

00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
i'll also mark this as a good first

00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,359
issue in case someone wants to pick this

00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,680
one up

00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:39,200
once i'm happy we'll save the issue to

00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,440
make sure we don't lose track of the

00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:43,520
work we want to do

00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,359
excellent we'll get back to working on

00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,119
that right away

00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:48,960
while we've had the security tab on your

00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:50,720
project for a little while now

00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,240
today i'm pleased to announce that

00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,079
enterprises with github advanced

00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:56,319
security now have a security tab

00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:58,000
added to their organizations where you

00:53:56,319 --> 00:54:00,720
can get a quick summary of

00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,480
all the projects you also have an

00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,319
overview of all the projects in your

00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,160
organization and what the status is of

00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:07,920
their security features

00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:10,079
i'm also pleased to announce that this

00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,319
is now available to teams who can see

00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:15,599
the security status of the repositories

00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:17,839
that they administer with that back to

00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:20,960
you shanku

00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:21,440
thank you nirushan now we've got our

00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,400
code

00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,760
written reviewed and committed where our

00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,640
code really belongs

00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,760
is in our users hands and that means

00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,839
shipping

00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,440
doing the functional testing sharing

00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:34,559
with stakeholders and getting them to

00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,240
sign off

00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:37,680
and releasing the production and

00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:40,319
celebrating together

00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:42,160
now github's new tools were designed to

00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,880
make it easy to test and release

00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:47,520
together

00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:50,000
as a team to show us more here's katie

00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,520
thanks chanku hey everyone now we have a

00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
release that's ready to head out the

00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,920
door

00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,119
thanks to a tool we already have a draft

00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,720
of our release notes

00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:59,040
let's edit a new release based on the

00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:02,319
draft notes

00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:04,079
first i'm going to set the title

00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:07,839
then i'll check the draft notes that

00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:07,839
were automatically created

00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:11,760
to be honest these look pretty good

00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,599
already so i'm going to go ahead and

00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,760
publish this release

00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,680
now we have a workflow set up in actions

00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,559
to be triggered by the publication of a

00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,520
release

00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:23,040
with our new workflow visualization ui

00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,280
you can see the release is now deploying

00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,040
to staging

00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,040
then it'll run some end-to-end smoke

00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,960
tests before finally deploying to

00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,960
production

00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,480
while all of that is running let me show

00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,319
you how i've set this up

00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,480
let's take a look at the code in another

00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:41,240
tab in the github

00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:44,079
workflows folder we'll find the

00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:46,319
releases.yaml file

00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:48,160
in the release yaml you can see i've set

00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:50,720
up a couple of different triggers

00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:52,640
a manual trigger with workflow dispatch

00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:55,040
as well as triggers based on when a

00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:58,400
release is published

00:55:55,040 --> 00:56:00,720
in the deploy staging job i specify

00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,160
the environment name and url where this

00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,240
will be available

00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:06,319
you can see i'm also requesting the

00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,440
published token secret from github's

00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:10,079
built-in encrypted

00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,400
secrets fault after that job is

00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:15,839
completed we run our smoke test

00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:18,559
then a deployed production again

00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:19,119
specifying the environment name and url

00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:21,359
before

00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:23,839
calling the same action with published

00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:26,000
token as the secret

00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:27,599
now these steps are identical yet they

00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,280
publish to different places

00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:31,119
that's because we define a different

00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,880
publish token for each environment

00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:34,400
let me show you how we do this i head

00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,119
into project settings

00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,440
then in the new environment section i

00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,720
have

00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:42,880
staging and production

00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:45,200
on the staging environment you can see

00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:48,240
we have a published token defined

00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,559
in github's encrypted secret vault even

00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,040
as

00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:53,119
admin i only have access to update this

00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:55,599
i can't view it in the ui

00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:56,240
going back to production i have the

00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:58,079
production

00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,440
publish token defined in our secrets

00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,280
here as well

00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,880
but what's more interesting is that you

00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:05,040
can see i've set this up to require

00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,920
manual approval before code is deployed

00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,599
to production

00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,760
only people from this team can permit

00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:12,160
code to go live and there's a full audit

00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:14,640
trail to see who approved it

00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,839
great staging has been deployed and our

00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,839
smoke tests have run

00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:19,599
let's take a quick look at the staging

00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:21,839
environment

00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:24,000
awesome looks good i'm going to enter my

00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:27,839
id to test out my own graph and make

00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,839
sure everything's working well

00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:34,000
everything seems to be working well nate

00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:37,359
has code is included

00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,359
so i'm going to approve the release to

00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:42,720
production

00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,240
back in the github ui i can click on

00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,559
review deployments

00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:48,400
select the environment and leave a quick

00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:53,119
comment

00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:55,200
approve the deploy there we go

00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,960
deploying to production is underway

00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:59,680
again with a different publish token

00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,680
from staging

00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:08,160
and with that we're deployed i'm going

00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:11,440
to click the url just to validate

00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,559
great head over to skyline.github.com if

00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,400
you want to check out your own

00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:18,079
contribution graph in 3d

00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:20,720
back to you shinku thank you katie

00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:21,760
so there we are a complete way to build

00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,160
and to end

00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,599
join a team get into the code make your

00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,520
first contribution

00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:29,440
get code reviewed with your peers with

00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:31,920
the help of automated ci

00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,680
to keep your code and your secrets and

00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:36,559
your dependencies secure

00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:38,319
and test and ship and celebrate together

00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:40,799
now all asynchronous

00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:41,920
all remote friendly all available from

00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:44,240
anywhere in the world

00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,319
on github's planet scale cloud now

00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:48,960
software teams all across the world

00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:50,400
are using github to do incredible things

00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,760
one such story comes from

00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:56,079
india's own infosys

00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,760
like our most visionary clients partners

00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,839
our goal is to become a completely

00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:03,200
knowledge and data driven organization

00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:04,880
with agility built into our core so that

00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:07,040
we can sense all the business changes

00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,640
happening around us and continuously

00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:11,119
evolve in response

00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:13,040
at infosys we are envisioning ourselves

00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:14,640
to be a live enterprise powered by our

00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,839
digital platforms

00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,000
our developers architects and

00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:20,000
practitioners

00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,319
are at the forefront of this leading it

00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,440
for us and our endeavor is to enhance

00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:25,680
their experience

00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:27,599
make them highly effective and efficient

00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:30,079
in everything that they are doing

00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:32,240
our digital platforms for productivity

00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:34,799
and the engineering tools ecosystem

00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:36,880
allows us to do this at scale and drive

00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:39,680
any change at the organization level

00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,400
in an accelerated manner our engineering

00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,359
tools

00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,559
and the continuously evolving ecosystem

00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:47,359
of homegrown

00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:49,440
open source and off-the-shelf tooling

00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:52,480
forms an important cog in the wheel

00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:54,079
to drive agility and scale in a secured

00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:57,440
manner

00:59:54,079 --> 01:00:00,880
for instance infosys devsecops platform

00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,520
polycloud meridian leap modernization

01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,520
suit

01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:05,440
are some of the examples of assets that

01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:07,119
power this for us

01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,440
github is a critical element of this

01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:11,119
ecosystem and is central to driving

01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:14,480
developer productivity

01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:14,720
secure sdlc inner sourcing reusability

01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,480
and

01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:19,200
augmenting the developer analytics for

01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:21,520
us it is unifying the experience of

01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,319
of our developers by a variety of

01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:25,119
integrations

01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:26,640
around the robust devsecops ecosystem it

01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:28,079
is also a key enabler

01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,240
for our live enterprise store and

01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:30,960
marketplace where we plan to bring

01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,640
together

01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:35,520
the community of cloud builders and

01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:38,480
cobalt from amongst our partners

01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:39,359
clients open source academia and these

01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,359
startups

01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:42,880
to drive contributions and consumption

01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:45,200
of various assets

01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:47,359
as well as enhance the ecosystem with an

01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:49,040
open source first thinking

01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:50,880
something i believe that any

01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:52,960
forward-looking enterprise

01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,200
engineering teams and developers would

01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:57,040
appreciate in a big big way

01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:59,680
as the github team continues to drive

01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:01,280
the roadmap i look forward to seeing

01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:03,040
several of the new capabilities around

01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:05,599
security code scanning

01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:07,040
telemetry observability analytics and

01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:09,760
github actions

01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,240
that can keep on taking us ahead in our

uh we'll be hanging out there as well

01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:29,839
the github subject matters

01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:31,839
uh we'll also be there with the

01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:33,359
community engaging during the sessions

01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:35,679
and we'll be taking your questions for

01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:37,279
speaker q a as well so go ahead and join

01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:40,239
in the discussions at

01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,960
dot com forward slash discussions um and

01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:42,640
don't forget

01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,480
there were workshops happening yesterday

01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:46,480
as well and those workshops were

01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:48,480
amazing and there's more workshops to

01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:49,600
come today if you've already signed up

01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:52,159
as well

01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,799
so what's coming up today um i know that

01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:54,319
you all

01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:55,920
all of you folks are probably wondering

01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:57,759
what that is so on the open source

01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:59,679
channel we've got speakers from chatwood

01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:01,839
layer 5 and github covering topics

01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:03,359
ranging from ci workflows to github

01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:05,440
being like a boss as well

01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:06,640
and then over on the devops channel um

01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:08,880
they're going to be getting into

01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,400
emma lop's workflow automation and

01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:12,640
everything about github

01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:14,159
actions so you know what without further

01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:17,600
ado let's get into it

01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:19,759
who do we have up first karen

01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,960
you know one of our first speakers

01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:23,759
starting off today

01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:25,920
uh is one of my favorites as well as you

01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:29,199
know one of the favorite histories of

01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:31,520
the open source uh you know ecosystem

01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:34,319
out over there so our first speaker who

01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:37,120
we have is dr viral shah who

01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:38,480
is the co-creator of the julia

01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:41,679
programming language

01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:44,799
and also the ceo of julia computing so

01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:47,359
uh he's going to be talking about how

01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:49,520
julia was built in the open their

01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:51,679
journey their challenges and

01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:53,279
you know what all a is in store so it's

01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:53,839
going to be really interesting to learn

01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:56,000
about

01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:57,920
how an entire programming language was

01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,159
was built in the open and then

01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,600
get an insight into all of the all of

01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:03,600
the journey behind it

01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,040
so don't forget if you have any

01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:07,600
questions uh

01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:08,960
do drop them on the discussions on

01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,120
github satellite dot com

01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:12,000
and kidup satellite dot com slash

01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:14,880
discussions

01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,679
once viral's uh talk is over we'll be

01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:18,080
taking up

01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:19,679
some of the questions live for him as

01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,560
well as he'll be hanging around on

01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:23,679
discussions

01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:25,120
after his talk as well for taking up q a

01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:27,679
on the discussion thread

01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:29,120
so without further delay i'm very very

01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:32,800
excited let's welcome

01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:32,800
viral shah vera

01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:39,840
hello hi thanks karin for that wonderful

01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,400
introduction

01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:44,159
and i'm viral shah one of the creators

01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:46,000
of the julia programming language

01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:48,800
and also co-founder and ceo of julia

01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,679
computing i'm going to talk about how we

01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:52,640
build julia

01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:53,040
and our community out in the open a lot

01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,760
of it

01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:56,800
mostly on github and and everything i'm

01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:59,199
going to talk about

01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:03,040
is is not just about me but about what

01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:03,040
the broader julia community has built

01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:09,760
so julia has been a long journey it's

01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:13,360
been around for

01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:14,719
almost 11 years now and we started this

01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:16,880
journey in 2009

01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:17,840
with an urge to solve the two language

01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,320
problem

01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,840
the two language problem very simply put

01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:24,080
is

01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:26,640
is a phrase that we coined actually

01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:28,159
after after starting the julia project

01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,920
and the reason why we had to come up

01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,800
with it was because it was hard to

01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:32,640
explain what

01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:34,320
why why the world needed a new

01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,600
programming language why did the world

01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:37,440
need julia

01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:39,679
and the reason it the reason is as

01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:42,640
follows right you everyone's used to

01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:44,719
programming with python with r with

01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:47,920
matlab with all of these

01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:50,239
interpreted languages that are you know

01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:51,840
not not really great for performance but

01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:52,719
then you always end up writing your

01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,520
programs in c

01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:57,280
c plus plus fortran java in order to get

01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,000
higher performance so people like to

01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,760
have

01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,640
a certain kind of language for data

01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:05,679
exploration for interactive exploration

01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:07,040
for um you know for for just sort of

01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:08,400
interacting with your algorithms and

01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,360
then another language for getting

01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,280
performance

01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:13,840
and it's really odd to write the same

01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:16,159
program twice and this is why

01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:17,920
we started out by creating julia to

01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:19,040
solve this two language problems so that

01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,440
you can have

01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:24,800
the ease of python and the speed of c

01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:26,880
all in one package in one language

01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:29,040
so in 2009 we wrote the first line of

01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:31,199
code and in 2012

01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:32,960
we actually published a post a blog post

01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:34,400
called why we created julia if you if

01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,280
you google that term you'll land up

01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,199
right there

01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:38,400
and you'll see what what it was about

01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:40,239
and

01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,920
a lot of what we wrote back then still

01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:43,679
holds true and this is how julia got

01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:46,560
started it was the four of us

01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:48,800
um with uh jeff bizanson stefan

01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:50,640
karpinsky and alan aylman

01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,960
those were three of my co-creators with

01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:55,120
whom i started the julia project

01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,960
and just like many open source projects

01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:58,080
it completely started out with an email

01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:00,080
conversation

01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:02,000
i was actually based out of bangalore

01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:03,840
when i started this project

01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,360
and and three of my collaborators were

01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,960
based out of the us

01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:08,400
but all of us were in very different

01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:11,280
geographies and

01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:12,960
uh it was a completely distributed setup

01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:15,520
in in where we started uh

01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:17,520
you know talking by email set up a git

01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,000
server this was this was not yet on

01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,560
github

01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,280
back then we actually had a git server

01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,800
at

01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:25,760
the university of california at santa

01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:27,600
barbara that stefan used to maintain and

01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:30,080
very early on in the project's life we

01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,600
actually ended up moving to github

01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:34,560
some of the other milestones for the

01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:37,040
project julia became the ju in jupiter

01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,480
uh in 2013 the second language that was

01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:40,640
added to jupiter

01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:43,040
for those of you who do not uh know this

01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:44,880
jupiter notebooks uh

01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:46,960
are extremely common for data science

01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,000
and they stand for julia python and r

01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:51,199
and so julius j

01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,880
in jupiter in 2015 we actually founded

01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:54,640
julia computing because of all the

01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,679
interest around the julia programming

01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:57,280
language and

01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:59,120
some of the first companies started

01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:02,400
using julia commercially

01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:05,520
we hit 1 million downloads in 2017.

01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,640
1.0 was released in 2018 in julia conn

01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:09,600
in london

01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:11,440
and 2019 saw 10 million julia downloads

01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,159
we were extremely thrilled to receive

01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,159
the

01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:15,600
the wilkinson prize for our

01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:18,560
contributions to julia

01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:19,520
and also the sydney fernbark price um

01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:22,320
last year was

01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:24,880
a couple of years ago now and we are now

01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:27,520
close to 25 million downloads

01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,000
and even though my slide says julia 1.5

01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,000
released

01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,480
in fact yesterday we just released julia

01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,320
1.6 it has been getting rave reviews

01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,760
um it was trending on hacker news just

01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:38,239
about yesterday and

01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:39,040
uh it's it's it's obviously the best

01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:42,800
release for

01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:44,960
of julia ever so far

01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,640
so while julia as a programming language

01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:48,080
solved the two language problem for

01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:50,880
scientists and engineers

01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:52,960
uh you know it it really is making

01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:55,520
impact in the real world

01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:57,120
people are using julia for faster drug

01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,480
development

01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:00,719
you know companies like paiser and

01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:01,840
moderna are using julia to come up with

01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:04,400
new drugs

01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:06,800
and and take them through uh their drug

01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:10,320
the the drug pipeline process

01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:12,080
in a faster way um companies

01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:14,239
like mitsubishi electric are working

01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:16,239
with us uh mitsubishi electric research

01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:17,760
labs on energy efficient buildings and

01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:20,000
air conditioning systems

01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:22,000
with julia we were able to simulate some

01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,000
of these air conditioning systems 500

01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,920
times faster than was possible

01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,600
before and that means that a year's

01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:29,760
worth of simulation of how

01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:31,520
an air conditioning system might react

01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,199
to all the changes in

01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,880
in temperature and weather and so on and

01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:36,480
so forth can now be done in a few days

01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,920
because of julia

01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,840
we're working with the team at carnegie

01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:41,040
mellon with uh professor venkat

01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:44,159
vishwanathan on

01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:46,560
coming up with uh new battery new

01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:48,560
new and efficient batteries uh like the

01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:50,080
kinds that go into electric aircraft

01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:51,679
coming up with new materials for these

01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,800
batteries and new simulation

01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:55,520
technologies

01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:56,400
uh for for sort of putting batteries

01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:59,199
into new uh

01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,520
electric aircraft hardware or um you

01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:01,760
know

01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:03,760
there's a lot of work by the climate

01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,640
machine project between mit and caltech

01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:06,719
where julia

01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:07,760
and its scientific machine learning

01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:10,640
ecosystem

01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:11,760
are being used for climate science and

01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:14,719
climate modeling

01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:16,800
and its impact on agriculture and and on

01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:19,360
just a number of many different

01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,000
applications so these are some really

01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:22,000
difficult

01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,040
scientific problems that julia is

01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,280
addressing

01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:27,520
today and what i'm going to talk about

01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:29,600
is the journey from

01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:30,800
developing the julia language developing

01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:33,199
a community

01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,840
you know building out julia computing

01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:35,679
and then

01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:38,800
being able to actually work on some of

01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:40,640
these cutting edge problems

01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:42,320
so here's the the julia project on

01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:44,640
github it's um

01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:46,560
you know just uh julia lang slash julia

01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,600
julia lang is the organization julia's

01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:50,960
the project

01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:53,920
it has 33 000

01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:55,760
stars and uh tons and tons of comments

01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,640
uh yeah there you go close to 50 000

01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,960
comments

01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,800
and um you know all these many fork so

01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:04,080
it is a living breathing project

01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:07,040
with over over 1 100 contributors to the

01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:07,040
main julia project

01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:12,159
i don't like this little red check box

01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:13,920
here as as anyone who's been on github

01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:16,320
likes it this is this is a screenshot

01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:18,719
that i just took before this talk but

01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:21,120
we worked very hard to make our ci green

01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:23,840
but this ci is very demanding

01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,640
we actually run our own uh ci systems

01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:28,000
that

01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:29,360
test every commit of julia on 32-bit

01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,159
64-bit intel

01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:33,120
arm you know and and and all sorts of

01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:35,199
architectures

01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:37,040
on windows mac linux so it is it is a

01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:38,960
difficult ci to pass

01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:40,400
but we take it very seriously as i said

01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:43,360
we released 1.6

01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:44,960
just a couple of days ago one of the

01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,280
things i wanted to do for this talk was

01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,600
that

01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:49,520
the dig back into my own first commit

01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,400
out of uh you know into julian turns out

01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:53,520
that was in

01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:56,239
september of 2009 where we uh

01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,800
had uh where my first commit was

01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:59,360
actually

01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:00,960
to add some of the array array

01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:02,719
operations into julia

01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:04,239
and it's it's just all looks so

01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:04,640
different i mean we have we didn't even

01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:07,280
have

01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:08,640
jl extensions back then they were dot j

01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,840
and then you can sort of see how the

01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:11,600
project's going

01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:13,600
we added the plus method right there

01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,400
implemented edition for double scalars

01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:17,920
and

01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,920
and you know we're off to the races

01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:22,480
one of the things i like to highlight

01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:24,159
about julia is that we started out

01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:26,320
you know i personally started out my

01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:27,280
work and my contributions to julia in

01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:30,159
india and i

01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:32,480
i wrote a majority of my julia code out

01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:34,159
of india for the first several years

01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:35,840
this is a picture of many of the early

01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:38,880
contributors to julia from

01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:40,640
julia corn india 2015 and

01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,080
we we wish to be able to do more julia

01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:44,320
cons in india going

01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:47,120
going forward but this is a small team

01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:47,120
that got started

01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:51,760
indian indian open source contributors

01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:54,000
have had an outsize uh

01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:55,920
impact on the julia language apart from

01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,520
some of the people i have here

01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:59,440
i should also mention that uh

01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:02,159
contributors from india are

01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:03,120
are a part of the google summer of core

01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:05,040
project

01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:06,719
every year at least you know anywhere

01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:08,480
between one third and one half of the

01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:10,640
contributors that we

01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:12,239
uh that we mentor in the google summer

01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:14,800
of course program are actually

01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:16,880
uh out of indian universities and so

01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:19,520
it's not only sort of people

01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:20,239
contributing to julia from the industry

01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:22,320
but we have

01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:23,440
a lot of people from indian universities

01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,880
undergraduates

01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:26,719
especially that are contributing to

01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:28,080
julia and the community has seen

01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:30,320
exponential growth

01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:32,080
it has been you know we've seen 25

01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:34,239
million downloads so far

01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:36,239
they've been compounding year on year

01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:38,640
tons and tons of youtube views check out

01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:39,360
uh alan edelman's computational thinking

01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:42,239
class

01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:43,760
computational thinking.mit.edu which i

01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:46,320
think is the best way to learn julia and

01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:48,880
some of the scientific machine learning

01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:50,000
examples that i showed before we have a

01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:52,239
forum views on

01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,280
uh uh we have we use this course for our

01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:54,640
forums

01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:56,640
you know the number of news articles the

01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:58,000
number of julia packages 5 000 julia

01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:00,719
packages today

01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:03,040
and it has been a phenomenal journey not

01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:05,280
only can you call these 5 000 packages

01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:07,280
from julia but you can also call every

01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:08,480
python and r package and every cn

01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:11,199
fortran library

01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:12,960
every java library ever written so often

01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:14,320
people ask me that you know hey it's a

01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:16,000
new language

01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:18,000
and maybe it doesn't have enough

01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,239
packages and i say not only can we call

01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,840
the 5000 packages in julia but just

01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:24,159
about everything else

01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:26,719
and especially python packages are a

01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:28,320
breeze to call python in our packages

01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:31,280
you pretty much do not have to do any

01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:33,199
boilerplate to call them

01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:35,600
julia has now entered the mainstream we

01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:38,719
were number 19 on ieee spectrum

01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:40,000
and in 2020 we went from 47 to 23 on the

01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:41,840
tyobi index

01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,600
uh some of these indexes are very noisy

01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,560
but you know directionally julia has

01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,960
been doing

01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:48,880
really well on many measures of

01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:50,159
popularity of programming languages as

01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:52,960
flawed as they all are

01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:55,040
i think they do pitch they do sort of

01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:57,120
paint a long-term picture

01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:59,040
my personal estimate is that the julia

01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:02,000
community is over

01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:03,920
a million users now worldwide we've seen

01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,120
downloads from over 10 000 companies

01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:07,360
from

01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:08,800
julia computing you're seeing it being

01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:10,639
used and taught at over 1500

01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,520
universities including some of the best

01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:14,880
ones

01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:15,280
out there and you know here's some of

01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,800
the

01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:19,440
the universities that are actually

01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:21,520
teaching and using julia

01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:23,840
there's over 100 github organizations

01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:25,679
and this is this is unique about julia

01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,920
i think compared to many open source

01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:30,159
languages because julia was developed on

01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:32,080
github from a very early

01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:33,199
stage and so the github community

01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:36,320
structure match

01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:37,600
matches and maps to um github

01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:40,080
organizations uh

01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,639
it's just something that has been built

01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,639
up

01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:44,800
organically over time and you can look

01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:47,440
at this right there's a climate

01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,800
org there's a eco julia which is for

01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:51,360
ecology flux ml

01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:53,920
is our machine learning organization

01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:56,080
julia actions is where a lot of our

01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:58,080
ci work uh you know and the github

01:21:56,080 --> 01:22:00,080
actions are held or julia very for

01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:02,560
raspberry pi or turing lang here for

01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:04,719
example for probabilistic programming

01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:06,239
uh julia images for image processing so

01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:07,760
these these are just fantastic

01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:10,080
organizations um

01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:11,360
that that we've been seeing people put

01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:13,040
up and i just love

01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:15,440
all the all the logos that people have

01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:17,520
come up with which are sort of based on

01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:19,920
the julia logo itself and the colors and

01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,920
the theme

01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:24,080
how fast is julia it is really fast this

01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,840
is the benchmark

01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:28,000
that is on the the computer language

01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,840
benchmarks came on debian julia is in

01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:33,280
the top five with c rust in

01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:35,679
uh fortran you have julia right up there

01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:36,400
and um you know really fast with graph

01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:38,480
processing

01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,679
you know with with basic data science

01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:42,560
machine learning

01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:44,080
loading csv files turns out to be really

01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,199
really fast in julia because of

01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:47,840
multi-threading

01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:50,159
and some of our data frames benchmarks

01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:53,120
also show julia comparing very well with

01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:55,440
some very um you know some very uh

01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:58,800
optimized tools like spark and

01:22:55,440 --> 01:23:00,560
pandas so so julia is fast but

01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,560
don't take my word for it try it out

01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,840
yourself there's a growing collection of

01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:05,520
julia books out there

01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:07,760
that that have been all contributed by

01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:10,320
the community many of these are from

01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:12,320
uh professors at stanford especially

01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:13,840
linear algebra and optimization are two

01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:15,199
of my favorite books i would highly

01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:16,639
recommend some of these books these are

01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:18,400
beautifully produced books

01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:20,480
but then at the other extreme we have a

01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:21,679
book by ahansen gupta

01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:24,560
which is the little book of julia

01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:26,480
algorithms for for kids to learn julia

01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:28,239
and and we've seen kids as as young as

01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:32,000
10 years old learning julia from

01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:34,000
from that book one of the one of the

01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,800
most interesting things about julia i

01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,719
think is in terms of user experiences is

01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:40,960
pluto notebooks of course visual studio

01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:42,400
code has now become the ide of choice

01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:44,560
for julia users

01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:48,320
but pluto notebooks have been developed

01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:50,960
by by fonz van der pla from

01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:52,480
amsterdam and and this is a reactive

01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:54,960
lightweight notebook

01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:56,159
so jupyter is a general purpose notebook

01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:59,040
environment that

01:23:56,159 --> 01:24:00,800
is a language agnostic whereas pluto is

01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:03,199
a julia specific notebook

01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:04,560
which means that it's reactive when you

01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:06,639
update a cell out there it will

01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:08,560
automatically update the calculations

01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:09,920
in all the other cells i would highly

01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:13,760
recommend checking out

01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:16,480
the juliacon 2020 talk by fonz

01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:18,239
i will also point out that con 2021 is

01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,679
coming up very soon it's going to be at

01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:22,320
the end of july

01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:23,920
um sign up at juliacon.org sign ups are

01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:25,840
free and the conference is online this

01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:27,840
year

01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:30,320
so all this is great now how do we go

01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:33,360
from you know building a community

01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:35,199
building out julia to sort of

01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,719
you know solving all those interesting

01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:38,320
problems that i talked about right

01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:41,040
problems that the world is facing

01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:43,440
problems in you know in climate and

01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:44,159
problems you know in combating a

01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:46,880
pandemic

01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:48,159
or you know how how do you cool your

01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,679
houses when the weather

01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:52,320
keeps heating up or the climate keeps

01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:54,400
heating up machine learning is a major

01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:55,840
part of this and and what julia does

01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,679
fantastically

01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:59,920
compared to many of the other

01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:01,840
programming languages is that

01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:03,520
it takes machine learning to the next

01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:05,840
level by integrating it

01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:07,440
deeply into the language a concept that

01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,920
we refer to as differentiable

01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:11,679
programming

01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:13,679
and and the way this all works out is as

01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:15,520
follows right everyone's familiar with

01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:17,199
uh machine learning enormous data sets

01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,080
distributed computing lots of new

01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:20,000
hardware

01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:21,840
gotta run on raspberry pi's gotta run on

01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,239
android but what really makes it all

01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:24,719
happen

01:25:22,239 --> 01:25:26,719
is automatic differentiation the ability

01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:28,239
to differentiate your programs not just

01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:29,280
your neural networks and do back

01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:31,600
propagation

01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:34,159
but can i do back propagation through my

01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:35,600
entire julia programs through my solvers

01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:37,600
you know through my optimization

01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:39,040
routines through you know

01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,480
through just about everything right

01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,920
through differential equation solvers

01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:44,639
and so on and so forth

01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:46,400
and that is this basic idea is at the

01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:48,800
crux of all of julius iml

01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:50,639
ecosystem and it's possible because

01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,760
julia's machine learning libraries have

01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:55,040
been natively written

01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:56,960
in julia itself so for example if you

01:25:55,040 --> 01:26:00,560
look at pytorch or tensorflow

01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:02,400
there's tons of cuda and c

01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:03,679
but but julia's machine learning

01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:08,480
libraries are written

01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:11,440
in native julia itself

01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:12,960
here's julia gpu so so julia also runs

01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:16,159
natively on gpus

01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:17,600
and um this is just these are benchmarks

01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:18,480
compared to cuda c as you can see

01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,560
they're

01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:22,560
you know almost as fast in some cases

01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:24,000
faster than kudasi and some cases a

01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:26,400
little bit slower

01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,400
but native gpu programming in julia is

01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,440
essential for the julia machine learning

01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:30,639
ecosystem

01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:33,120
and the scientific machine learning

01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:35,679
ecosystem in julia it's being used for

01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:39,360
tons of interesting product at julia

01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:39,360
or download the package and try it out

01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:43,040
so all of this comes together the gpu

01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:44,800
capabilities the flux

01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:47,199
machine learning capabilities and just

01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:48,719
about everything in julia comes together

01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:50,960
in you know with what we call

01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:52,800
differentiable programming and and

01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:54,480
what julia offers is language-wide

01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,080
differentiable programming

01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:58,320
which means that not only with your

01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:59,199
neural networks but any arbitrary julia

01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:01,199
code

01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:02,880
is amenable to differentiation which

01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:04,000
means it's amenable to be put into a

01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:05,760
machine learning loop

01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,760
it's amenable to stochastic gradient

01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:09,679
descent and optimization

01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:11,199
and this is something that scientists

01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:14,159
and engineers around the world

01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:15,360
are combining they're taking julia's

01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:16,639
traditional machine learning

01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:18,000
capabilities and deep learning

01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:21,360
capabilities like the flux

01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:23,280
library and combining that with

01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:26,080
all the scientific and machine learning

01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:28,400
and image processing and data processing

01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:29,199
and differential equation libraries

01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:31,120
together

01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:32,320
so that you can apply some of these

01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:35,520
ideas

01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:37,040
into into just about every juilliard

01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:39,840
program ever written

01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:41,520
and combined your data-driven machine

01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:42,320
learning that comes out of deep learning

01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:44,080
with

01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:46,719
model-driven scientific learning and

01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:48,159
sort of get the best of both worlds

01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:50,000
i would highly recommend looking at

01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:52,480
christopher caucus's talks online

01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,080
uh where he uh talks about you know he's

01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:55,360
the author of julia's scientific machine

01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:56,880
learning ecosystem

01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:58,400
and he talks about all these different

01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:00,239
applications uh if you just

01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:01,760
look at look him up on youtube

01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:02,960
applications in pharmaceuticals in

01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:05,679
engineering and chemistry and

01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:07,679
manufacturing in batteries in climate

01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:08,719
this is this is how the ecosystem comes

01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:10,480
together

01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:12,239
and this is why i personally believe

01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:13,600
that a programming language can really

01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:15,520
change the world

01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:17,360
it's it's all built by the julia

01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:19,120
community it builds up

01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:21,679
one foundation you know builds up from

01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:24,639
the foundation one step at a time

01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:27,120
and goes up all the way to solving

01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:30,480
amazing and interesting problems

01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:31,040
out there what do we do at julia

01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:32,560
computing

01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:34,400
i'd like to sort of leave you guys with

01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:36,400
a small advertisement about julia hub

01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:39,120
julia hub is a platform that

01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:39,920
is built to provide the best julia

01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:42,239
experience

01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:44,239
where you can explore build run scale

01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:46,639
and visualize your julia programs

01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:47,280
you get online vs code editing along

01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:50,000
with

01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:52,719
scaling julia programs to large numbers

01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:55,040
of gpus and cpus on the cloud

01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:56,719
and all these amazing workflows right

01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,600
from the julia language and the julia

01:28:56,719 --> 01:28:59,840
compiler

01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:01,199
the thousands of libraries all the

01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:02,560
machine learning ecosystem the

01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:03,840
scientific machine learning tools the

01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:06,880
parallelization

01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:09,360
the gpu computing all the way up to

01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:10,080
you know solving some of these problems

01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:12,560
these entire

01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:14,800
ecosystems are being put together on

01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:17,120
julia hub so that they're available to

01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:19,120
everyone from students to scientists at

01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:22,719
some of the best companies out there

01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:24,159
at uh you know just just put it all

01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:26,560
on their fingertips that's what julia

01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:27,199
hub enables so i would urge you all to

01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:29,679
try it out

01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:30,800
you know try it out at juliahub.com and

01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:33,120
let us know

01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:35,199
what your experience is out there come

01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:39,280
join the julia community on github and

01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:41,600
i'm going to be talking on

01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:44,400
on the discussions right after my talk

01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:44,400
thank you very much

01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:56,800
wow okay that was uh you know

01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:58,239
uh viral shah uh who has gave such a

01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:00,800
nice overview of uh

01:29:58,239 --> 01:30:02,080
julia hey viral you know we're just

01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:04,400
having a little bit of

01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:06,320
you know an early holy celebration out

01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:08,960
here so all of these uh

01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:10,719
colors and confetti is what you can see

01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:11,440
but uh thanks a lot that was that was a

01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:13,440
really nice

01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:15,920
uh session about julia and we have quite

01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:18,320
some questions uh coming in

01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:19,360
so uh the first thing uh you know

01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:22,800
without that

01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:23,520
the developers want to know is julia

01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,840
being an

01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:26,560
open source programming language as well

01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:29,120
as

01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:29,600
uh you know where you have a business so

01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:31,360
how does

01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:33,360
how does julia computing build an open

01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:34,960
source business

01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:36,800
that's a very that's a very good

01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:37,360
question actually and one that i often

01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:39,280
get

01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:40,800
that you know what's what's open source

01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:42,639
and what's not and

01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:44,320
and how does an open source company make

01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:46,719
money and um

01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:48,000
you know we are we are committed to the

01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:49,600
open source community

01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,280
that's what created julia and the

01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:53,679
company exists to

01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:54,560
sort of leverage the community add to

01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:57,679
the community

01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:58,800
and and just sort of uh you know grow

01:30:57,679 --> 01:31:01,040
the community uh

01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:02,239
going forward so the way we the way we

01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:04,560
do it is that

01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:06,239
all of julia is open source the language

01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:08,639
the compiler the ecosystem

01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:09,280
and we are major contributors to it all

01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:11,679
the

01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:13,360
co-creators of the julia language are

01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:16,239
co-founders of julia computing

01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:17,280
and we have uh the best interest of the

01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:19,679
communities at

01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:21,040
heart what we like to do for our

01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:23,360
business for our customers

01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:25,280
is build a cloud-based software as a

01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:27,360
service

01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:28,800
product which is julia hub which is what

01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:31,199
was my last slide

01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:32,639
and we expect that by providing julia

01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:35,040
hub on the cloud

01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:36,960
to all the julia users out there in in

01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:39,280
enterprises and around the world

01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:40,800
is how we'll build a successful business

01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:42,400
and um

01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:44,800
these are these are very well aligned

01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:46,560
incentives because this means that there

01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:48,880
is not going to it's not an open

01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:51,280
core model it's not that optimization

01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:52,960
level dash o3 is only available by julia

01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:54,880
computing uh

01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:56,880
you know to its customers but that

01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:57,679
everything out there is in the open

01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,520
source

01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:01,440
is in the open domain and the company

01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:02,080
actually integrates it into a cloud

01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:05,120
service

01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:05,120
for enterprise users

01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:10,480
so i love that julia's open source yeah

01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:12,080
where can someone go and learn more

01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:13,440
about julia are there like online

01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:15,199
courses or is there anything that you

01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:18,719
can point us to

01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:20,719
well that's the so so there's um

01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:22,400
if you go to julia lang.org which is the

01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:23,360
julia website or if you just google

01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:26,080
julia

01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:26,400
you you know instead of getting um you

01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:29,840
know

01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:31,760
uh actresses named julia you nowadays

01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:33,199
get the julia language especially if

01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:33,760
you're a programmer on the google top

01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:36,320
hit

01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:37,840
so if you go to the giulia website

01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:40,560
there's a learning section

01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:41,280
and we also have juliacademy.com which

01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:43,199
are

01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:45,040
a free online courses for getting

01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:46,400
started with julia in addition to all

01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:49,040
the books that i mentioned

01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:51,280
but the julia learning the the learning

01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:55,760
page on julia lang.org

01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:57,840
puts everything together for learning

01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:58,880
that is that is viral that's gonna be

01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,600
probably my

01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:02,560
favorite sentence for the day that you

01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:04,159
said you know like

01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:06,239
when you go on the search engine and

01:33:04,159 --> 01:33:07,280
search for julia instead of actresses

01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:08,480
you will find the open source

01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:10,719
programming library that's

01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:11,600
that's that's really my best code for

01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:15,120
today you know

01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:16,880
so uh that's really great so uh coming

01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:20,560
back there's one more question

01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:22,159
so uh if you had to do you know one

01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:24,000
thing differently building the julia

01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:27,120
programming language today

01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,120
uh what would you have done

01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:31,679
yeah that's uh that's a very hard

01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:32,800
question actually what what would we

01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:35,199
have done differently

01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,400
uh if we were to build julia today right

01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:40,080
and uh

01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:41,760
i i i mean there are it's it's hard to

01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:43,360
say right because had we taken a

01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,159
slightly different path would things

01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:47,520
have been

01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:49,600
been different in some way um i

01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:51,360
to be honest you know it's all about the

01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:54,239
community and the journey

01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:56,159
and uh you know that's sort of far more

01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:56,880
interesting than any sort of technical

01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:59,840
decision

01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:00,239
around the language itself if anything i

01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:02,960
think

01:34:00,239 --> 01:34:04,159
um you know what what i would love to

01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:07,360
see happen in julia

01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:09,280
is you know some of the decisions that

01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:11,120
if if you were to start out now there

01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:13,440
are just so many more mature

01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:14,960
open source language frameworks that we

01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:16,560
can use today that were not available

01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:19,840
when we started 2009

01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:20,480
llvm had just come out back then and it

01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:22,719
was uh

01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:24,239
it was not what it is today but it has

01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:26,639
it has definitely been

01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:28,639
difficult for us working with llvm and

01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:30,400
seeing sort of some of the

01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:31,679
the challenges and so on and so forth so

01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,880
we might we might do a few things

01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:35,199
differently today it's not

01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:36,719
it's not clear what exactly would they

01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:38,239
be but um

01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:39,760
i you know i guess one of the things i

01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:41,920
would say is that i would

01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:43,360
work for even deeper integration of some

01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:45,600
of the machine learning

01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:47,440
uh tools that we talked about during my

01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:48,400
talk and and they would become even more

01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:50,080
first class

01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:51,840
as part of the julia language than they

01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:55,040
are today given just how important

01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:55,040
some of these technologies are

01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:00,960
nice you know so so you mentioned i like

01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:02,800
how you mentioned you know it was it's

01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:03,520
more about the community and the journey

01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:05,360
so

01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:06,880
uh where can where can someone go and

01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:07,760
then you know interact with the julia

01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:10,560
community

01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:12,560
find peers or find someone really to uh

01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:14,480
help them grow in their journey

01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:18,000
in learning the language and kind of

01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:18,000
like exploring it to its depths

01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:24,960
yeah um it uh so so again on

01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:25,679
julialang.org you have the community

01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:28,400
section

01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:30,960
which has all the community pointers we

01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:32,760
use discourse for our mailing list

01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:34,000
and discussion forum so

01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:37,119
discourse.julialang.org

01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:39,040
is a very vibrant community out there we

01:35:37,119 --> 01:35:41,199
also have the julia lang slack which has

01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:44,560
over 5000 people on it

01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:46,000
and it's just insane um so that that's a

01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:47,119
that's a good way for interactive

01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,199
communication

01:35:47,119 --> 01:35:51,040
but a lot of our community interactions

01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:53,199
also happen on github because you know

01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:54,880
you know if you post in a github comment

01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:56,880
and someone replies to you

01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:58,560
it's almost like chat it happens in real

01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:00,960
time and a lot of

01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:02,960
uh a lot of those comments a lot of

01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:05,440
those communications actually get

01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:07,119
you know archived and are crawlable by

01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:08,880
google and someone else can come

01:36:07,119 --> 01:36:10,880
a few months later a year later join

01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:12,400
into the discussion so there's there's

01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:14,400
many different forums uh

01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:16,080
for for people uh there's chat there's

01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:19,360
mailing lists there's github

01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:22,480
and all of them are are phenomenal

01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:24,880
um also julia packages are all 100

01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:26,080
on github um well maybe not 100 but

01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:28,239
definitely 99

01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:30,400
on github and all of them have their own

01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:32,400
issue trackers on github as well

01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:33,920
so i would say that you know if you're

01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:35,600
engaging with the community

01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:37,040
there's the language but then there's

01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:38,880
also all the packages and

01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:40,800
and a lot of people end up often working

01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:41,119
on the packages one of the things we've

01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:43,360
done

01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:45,520
over the last few years is is actually

01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:47,679
made it easy for people to do

01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:48,960
things in packages rather than in core

01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:51,679
julia itself

01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:53,199
and and sort of uh make it easy to

01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:54,320
extend julie and that's

01:36:53,199 --> 01:36:56,320
uh that's where we see a lot of

01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:59,040
discussion actually moving into packages

01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:59,040
uh going forward

01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:04,320
great thank you so much awesome

01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:06,320
fantastic

01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:07,840
and so yeah everyone head on over to

01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:09,520
github discussions uh viral is going to

01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:10,960
be there for the next 30 minutes to to

01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:12,159
continue answering your questions

01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,679
and you can post your questions at

01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:14,719
github satellite forward slash

passionate about it's

01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:11,520
it's about crossing the border of

01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:14,800
languages in open source you know

01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:16,000

know when you combine

01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:20,080
that with open source the impact that it

01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:23,199
can really make is

[Music]

hello

01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:47,520
thank you karan and hello everyone i am

01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:49,760
richard kumar senior director for

01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:51,760
software engineering here at github

01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:53,600
and i have an amazing panel of speakers

01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:54,800
with me who i'll introduce in just a

01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:57,600
minute

01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:59,360
so platforms like github provide tools

01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:01,600
and capabilities for developers

01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:03,119
anywhere in the world to solve problems

01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:05,040
learn from each other

01:40:03,119 --> 01:40:06,639
share their work and collaborate towards

01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:08,880
common goals

01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:10,080
today technology is at the heart of

01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:12,639
everything

01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:14,239
and access to technology is critical in

01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:17,679
helping us solve problems

01:40:14,239 --> 01:40:20,400
and to innovate in any area that said

01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:22,320
if we think about it uh the primary

01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:23,360
language in which developers are able to

01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:26,320
work today is

01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:28,159
english and access to majority of the

01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:29,280
technical content and programming

01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:31,760
frameworks

01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:33,360
assumes that one is well versed with the

01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:36,639
english language

01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:39,199
so are we leaving out a vast majority of

01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:41,280
people who do not fit this mold

01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:42,800
if you really want to be able to reach

01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:45,360
every aspiring developer

01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:46,800
and idea generator in india or other

01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:49,840
parts of the world

01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:52,000
which have so many different languages

01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:53,920
important for us that we transcend the

01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,400
language boundary

01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:58,000
luckily we have with us today two very

01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:59,440
accomplished people who have been

01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:02,159
thinking about this problem

01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:04,880
and are leading innovation in this space

01:41:02,159 --> 01:41:07,520
so join me in welcoming nikhil malhotra

01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:09,760
head of innovation at tech mahindra and

01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:11,600
creator of the bharat markup language

01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:14,000
which is an open source markup language

01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:16,880
for india and kailash nad

01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:18,320

01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:20,400
of olam and lr

01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:22,000
which are open source regional language

01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:23,920
dictionaries

01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,520
um nikhil and kailash we are eager to

01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:27,280
hear about you know what has what have

01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:27,920
been some of the motivating factors for

01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:30,159
you

01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:32,880
uh how do you see this problem space and

01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:35,520
some of the ways that you have um

01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:36,719
uh started tackling this so nikhil let's

01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:38,480
start with you

01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:40,000
uh tell us more about how you would

01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:41,119
frame the problem that you're trying to

01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,800
address and

01:41:41,119 --> 01:41:45,119
also tell us a bit more about bharat

01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:47,440
markup language

01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:48,880
i'm sure richard um first of all thank

01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:50,639
you so much to github um

01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:52,239
i i know this is an open forum in an

01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:53,920
open community and then taking it

01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:55,440
forward to this community is a is a

01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:57,040
great privilege as well

01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:58,960
i think the problem's always been there

01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:00,159
which are if you if you notice right the

01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:03,360
90 percent

01:42:00,159 --> 01:42:03,600
of us in india speak vernacular and we

01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,199
are

01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:07,199
you know about 10 percent of us are only

01:42:05,199 --> 01:42:09,600
well versed in english language

01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:11,199
my inspiration comes from um you know

01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:13,119
one of the mentorship that i was doing

01:42:11,199 --> 01:42:15,280
with the utterly incubation centers

01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:16,560
with you know a few of the kids and this

01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:18,800
was a program called

01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:19,920
a student innovator program or student

01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:22,080
to society

01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:23,840
and we had students from both urban and

01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:25,360
rural sectors and one of the

01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:27,520
you know the teams that one was a rural

01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:29,679
sector team from chhattisgarh

01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:31,280
these four students used to walk about

01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:34,159
45 kilometers

01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:36,080
every day to go to school and you know

01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:36,560
you call it scientific serendipity you

01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:40,080
call it

01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:42,960
thought they dropped in red amaranthus

01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:44,639
green amaranthus and some kind of bajra

01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:46,320
on a piece of land

01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:48,639
the wheat that grew out they actually

01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:50,800
took juice out of it and

01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:52,480
that particular jew started solving a

01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:54,239
problem of malnutrition in that area

01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:56,000
this project has been now

01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:58,000
under the eyes of unicef and people are

01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,159
looking at it so i was

01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,679
amazed by the ingenuity and of course

01:43:00,159 --> 01:43:02,719
there was a challenge to solve and these

01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:04,320
guys were solving it

01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:06,320
but then they came to us for mentorship

01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:08,159
and we gave them mentorship regarding

01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:08,960
how can you put it into a packaged

01:43:08,159 --> 01:43:11,600
product

01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:13,119
how can you put it into seeds format etc

01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:14,880
but one of the students asked me sir i

01:43:13,119 --> 01:43:15,920
want to learn technology but i don't

01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:18,320
know english

01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:20,159
so that was possibly the starting point

01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:20,800
that got me thinking about a year back

01:43:20,159 --> 01:43:24,000
saying

01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:25,920
should india not have the ability

01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,600
or should indian you know indian kids

01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:28,880
not have the ability to quote something

01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:30,560
in their own language

01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:32,480
and that was the origination point of

01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:34,480
bahamal or bharat markup language

01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:36,960
now what does brahmal do it's actually

01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:39,040
open source it's available on bamal.org

01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:40,719
people can go and have a look at it but

01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:42,480
for the moment that we started off we

01:43:40,719 --> 01:43:45,119
said that let kids is at least

01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:46,880
code html by simple passing and

01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:48,320
transliteration in their own language so

01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:50,239
we've given

01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:52,239
12 languages for kids to code on it's

01:43:50,239 --> 01:43:54,080
hindi

01:43:52,239 --> 01:43:56,080
and then we said that you know once we

01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:56,480
go through this phase let kids try it

01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:59,040
out

01:43:56,480 --> 01:44:00,960
we will even go towards some more known

01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:02,800
languages like javascript

01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:04,639
like you know even scripting languages

01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:06,080
that we could do so that we could give

01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:08,639
that kind of a layer

01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:10,159
of abstraction to kids saying that now

01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:11,040
you should be able to code in your own

01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:14,159
language

01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:17,600
so that's basically and

01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:19,840
our attempt that's awesome uh

01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:21,840
nikhil it's great to see the the from

01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:23,920
where that you know motivation started

01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:26,719
and where you've been able to take it

01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:27,040
um uh wonderful to hear about that um

01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:29,679
can

01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:30,800
kailash what were the motivating factors

01:44:29,679 --> 01:44:32,800
behind

01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:34,480
the regional language dictionaries that

01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:35,840
you have started i know this has been an

01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:37,440
effort that's been going on for some

01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:40,080
time but would love to hear

01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:42,400
uh what kind of prompted you to do that

01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:44,400
and what you feel has been the impact or

01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:46,800
can continue to be the impact of some of

01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:46,800
this work

01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:51,199
so uh all in the first dictionary that

01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:53,760
came out

01:44:51,199 --> 01:44:54,880
uh came out 10 years ago almost 11 years

01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:58,000
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:59,119
and it was born out of my personal

01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:02,639
frustrations of

01:44:59,119 --> 01:45:06,960
not being able to find a decent digital

01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:09,920
malayalam dictionary that's what i speak

01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:11,760
and that pushed me down the rabbit hole

01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:12,480
of figuring out how the landscape of

01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:15,840
indian

01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:18,719
online dictionaries and i realized uh

01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:19,679
it was an abysmal landscape it wasn't

01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:21,760
anything

01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:22,880
and the few online dictionaries that

01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:24,719
were available

01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:25,920
they were riddled with ads you know the

01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:29,440
quality wasn't great

01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:32,000
uh the agenda was not really to run

01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:32,560
good dictionaries for the public it was

01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:36,560
i think

01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:39,600
you know commerce so

01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:41,760
i figured that there should be

01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:43,920
an open data high quality dictionary

01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:45,760
that is freely accessible to everyone

01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:47,360
not just people looking at

01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:48,880
definitions in a dictionary but

01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:52,320
researchers students

01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:54,320
anyone it should be open data and i

01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:56,560
uh put together a dictionary with a few

01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:59,920
thousand words that i entered myself

01:45:56,560 --> 01:46:02,159
and i found a few

01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:03,199
data sets small little datasets floating

01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:05,440
around on the internet

01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:07,119
unfortunately unattributed i put

01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:08,320
everything uh scraped everything

01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:10,560
everything together

01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:12,159
and built polum it was an english

01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:15,440
malayalam dictionary

01:46:12,159 --> 01:46:18,639
and it went live in 2010

01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:19,600
and today it's it's still it's still

01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:22,719
available on

01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:25,119
and there's a mobile app i think uh

01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:27,760
two to three million malayalam speakers

01:46:25,119 --> 01:46:30,480
use it every day

01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:33,119
so uh that does prove that there is a

01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:35,679
great need for open access open data

01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:37,679
language dictionaries in all languages

01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:41,520
so that's the story of poland

01:46:37,679 --> 01:46:44,400
is a recent addition when i completely

01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:45,280
randomly by happenstance came across v

01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:47,199
krishna

01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:49,360
who had spent 40 years building a

01:46:47,199 --> 01:46:52,000
dictionary

01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:52,880
which nobody really knew about and he

01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,800
was

01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:56,000
gracious enough to open source it so we

01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:59,040
took it the biggest

01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:02,880
authoritative canada english

01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:04,159
dictionary and it's it's called alar now

01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:05,280
it's available again open data

01:47:04,159 --> 01:47:09,119
directionally so

01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:11,679
that's two big open data regional

01:47:09,119 --> 01:47:11,679
dictionaries

01:47:13,119 --> 01:47:16,159
nice nice uh great to hear about that uh

01:47:15,199 --> 01:47:18,560
kailash

01:47:16,159 --> 01:47:19,280
and just kind of opening this up to both

01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:22,159
of you you know

01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:22,560
uh what have been some of the challenges

01:47:22,159 --> 01:47:24,480
that

01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:26,560
uh you know you all have faced as you've

01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:29,440
sort of embarked on these journeys

01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:29,840
and um you know how have you uh you know

01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:32,719
what

01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:33,440
tools or approaches have you used to

01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:37,440
help you

01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:39,199
make progress you know

01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:40,560
so i i'll take that question richard i

01:47:39,199 --> 01:47:42,000
think uh the one of the biggest

01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:42,719
challenges is of course lack of

01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,480
awareness

01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:46,400
and i think i would be very very open

01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:47,679
saying that the moment you get into a

01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:50,880
coding world

01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:52,880
there is a kind of a predistant or a

01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:54,239
kind of a predisposed notion that these

01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:56,239
are the languages and this is something

01:47:54,239 --> 01:47:58,639
that we've got to do

01:47:56,239 --> 01:48:00,159
and that is something that i think

01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:01,920
programs like github

01:48:00,159 --> 01:48:03,360
we going on the open source channel

01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:06,480
would really help us

01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:08,880
take it forward number one number two um

01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:09,520
a lot of people are not aware about the

01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:12,000
strengths

01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:12,880
of what local regional languages have

01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,639
you know and and

01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:16,320
and have been produced as well like

01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:18,400
kellage really mentioned

01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:20,719
that malayalam there's a there's a very

01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:22,560
very valid dictionary that is now made

01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:24,480
um you know my research started about

01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:26,400
three years back on sanskrit as well and

01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:27,840
um and i found out that there's so much

01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:28,800
to talk about natural language

01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:31,040
processing

01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:32,800
right over there in that language even

01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:35,840
though it may not be spoken

01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:38,239
very you know very openly it's only

01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:40,960
spoken in small parts and small sectors

01:48:38,239 --> 01:48:41,840
but sanskrit can give us that ability to

01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:44,239
understand

01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:45,760
the root of language as well as how the

01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:46,880
natural language processing systems

01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:49,520
could take place

01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:50,320
um so you know if if there is awareness

01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:52,719
then there is

01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:54,239
there is a sort of you know the people

01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:56,480
do understand what's the strength

01:48:54,239 --> 01:48:57,520
what are we doing for it i think number

01:48:56,480 --> 01:49:01,840
one um

01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:01,840
we i continue

01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:07,119
to talk about it in all forms letting

01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:08,719
people know

01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:09,840
you know i continue to say i continue to

01:49:08,719 --> 01:49:11,199
talk about what's going on with the

01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:11,840
language how is sunscreen basically

01:49:11,199 --> 01:49:13,599
going on

01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:15,280
uh what should be the next step number

01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:16,880
two is i've got some i've got a very

01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:18,080
very good team that is also now taking

01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:21,040
this language out to

01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:22,080
to young kids and and even sectors um

01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:24,480
yeah

01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:26,560
very interestingly i uh in my lab in

01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:28,239
makers lab there is a gentleman who was

01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:30,639
earlier an uber driver

01:49:28,239 --> 01:49:32,639
who actually learned over by the dent of

01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:35,040
his hard work or whatever

01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:36,000
python c c plus plus etc and he joined

01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:38,480
the lab now

01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,920
kovitt pushed him to the to the villages

01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:40,880
he's now in one of the villages in

01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:42,560
maharashtra

01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:44,560
so he's taken upon himself his name is

01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:47,040
satish he's taken upon himself

01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:48,560
he brings in students from about 30 40

01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:50,159
odd schools in the rural sector

01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:51,520
and he starts teaching them harmal he

01:49:50,159 --> 01:49:52,480
starts teaching them you know the coding

01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:54,639
language itself

01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:56,320
so that has been more of a generic

01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:57,599
effort that we've been doing to raise

01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:58,719
that awareness

01:49:57,599 --> 01:50:00,960
there are of course other channels that

01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:02,320
we are utilizing as marketing etc but uh

01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:03,119
awareness is one of the biggest things

01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:05,599
that we feel

01:50:03,119 --> 01:50:07,520
is the challenge at this point in time

01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:10,719
got it

01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:14,639
how about you kalash i i

01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:18,639
completely agree and that awareness also

01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:20,719
translates to a significant lack of

01:50:18,639 --> 01:50:21,920
academic and computing language

01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:25,119
resources

01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:27,520
and i've cited this example before

01:50:25,119 --> 01:50:28,239
building if you want to do nobody thinks

01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:29,679
twice about

01:50:28,239 --> 01:50:31,760
english string search you know you do

01:50:29,679 --> 01:50:34,560
control f you put your string in

01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:36,400
and you know uh search happens there are

01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:38,239
many different algorithms to do english

01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:39,679
string search and

01:50:38,239 --> 01:50:41,760
that's that's the case for latin

01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:44,800
languages but

01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:47,199
search for indic languages is

01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:48,800
an understudied research area and

01:50:47,199 --> 01:50:50,960
without academic research you can't

01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:53,599
really build tools that people can use

01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:55,360
so even to to get you know like simple

01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:56,560
phonetic search working for the

01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:58,639
dictionaries

01:50:56,560 --> 01:51:00,159
uh i figured you know there was nothing

01:50:58,639 --> 01:51:01,040
available so there was a lot of trial

01:51:00,159 --> 01:51:03,360
and error

01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:05,840
uh in a very non-academic sense to get

01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:07,119
that fundamental string search to work

01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:10,960
things have improved

01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:13,360
quite a bit over the last 10 years large

01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:14,960
there are large companies who offer free

01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:16,880
computing tools

01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:18,880
but it's definitely awareness and i

01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:19,679
think the site one of the side effects

01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:22,320
of

01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:23,599
language input becoming prevalent across

01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:26,800
mobile devices

01:51:23,599 --> 01:51:28,480
everywhere is i think people assume that

01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:29,920
the indic language problem is solved

01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:30,639
because you can read your language on

01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:32,320
the phone

01:51:30,639 --> 01:51:35,599
you can write your language on the

01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:37,280
keyboard but in fact the fact that

01:51:35,599 --> 01:51:39,040
language keyboards are now standard on

01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:40,800
all indian operating systems was in fact

01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:41,679
a community push that happened five six

01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:44,800
years ago

01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:45,440
if it wasn't for that you know uh like a

01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:47,119
force

01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:48,719
open source group pushing for that to be

01:51:47,119 --> 01:51:51,040
established wasn't for that i don't

01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:55,920
think we'd have standard input tools

01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:59,520
so there's an acute lack of awareness

01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:59,520
especially among i think

01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:04,800
amongst engineering folks also people

01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:05,280
assume the language problem is solved

01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,639
but

01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:10,400
when it comes to ending languages we

01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:10,400
haven't even scratched the surface

01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:14,400
makes sense i think what i'm hearing

01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:16,239
from you is that you know there have

01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:17,920
been some recent pushes which have i

01:52:16,239 --> 01:52:19,280
think which have helped the end

01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:22,719
consumers

01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:25,840
to be able to um you know see

01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:27,760
um a lot of content or apps

01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:30,639
in their language of choice but when it

01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:32,400
comes to really enabling the creators

01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:34,560
right we're still we still have a long

01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:37,599
way to go because of the lack of

01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:38,719
the content the lack of the tools

01:52:37,599 --> 01:52:41,360
frameworks

01:52:38,719 --> 01:52:42,080
uh which primarily uh work with english

01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:44,639
today

01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:45,360
and so i think the work that both of you

01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:48,159
are doing is

01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:48,639
is really going to help and uh you know

01:52:48,159 --> 01:52:51,360
take us

01:52:48,639 --> 01:52:53,360
a little bit forward on that path and uh

01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:55,040
you talked about uh you know

01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:56,560
technical challenges around string

01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:58,639
search and things like that

01:52:56,560 --> 01:53:00,080
and and both of you will probably have

01:52:58,639 --> 01:53:02,239
insights into this so

01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:03,920
how does that like you know is that um

01:53:02,239 --> 01:53:07,440
you know especially as you worked on

01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:10,800
two different languages dictionaries um

01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:12,480
are there patterns that that can scale

01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:14,719
out to other languages

01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:16,639
is it every time you're adding support

01:53:14,719 --> 01:53:18,560
for a new language are you kind of are

01:53:16,639 --> 01:53:20,639
we starting from scratch

01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:23,520
uh you know how maybe you can give us a

01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:26,320
little insight into um you know how

01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:27,840
how much effort is involved and what are

01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:30,639
some of the ways that people

01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:33,040
could contribute uh you know along this

01:53:30,639 --> 01:53:33,040
effort

01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:37,280
no absolutely richard i think digital

01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:39,119
content and content

01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:40,400
remains a challenge as kellogg rightly

01:53:39,119 --> 01:53:42,719
mentioned and i think

01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:44,560
my area has been to find the middle

01:53:42,719 --> 01:53:47,119
layer for sanskrit as well

01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:49,119
and i'm finding some patterns um you

01:53:47,119 --> 01:53:50,960
know wherever we

01:53:49,119 --> 01:53:52,480
as of languages across the across the

01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:53,040
subcontinent there are different

01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:54,880
patterns

01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:57,280
but then again these patterns need to be

01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:59,119
adjusted to that specific language now

01:53:57,280 --> 01:54:01,040
um just to give you an example a lot of

01:53:59,119 --> 01:54:03,119
people and and that's where

01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:04,080
if i may talk to the community in terms

01:54:03,119 --> 01:54:06,800
of

01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:08,719
what has been the genius that panini was

01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:09,599
and i think panami's genius was to

01:54:08,719 --> 01:54:11,760
understand

01:54:09,599 --> 01:54:12,800
where exactly is information encoded in

01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:15,040
our language so

01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:16,639
um how much of that information is

01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:18,800
encoded and what is there

01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:21,119
exactly which needs to be grabbed up if

01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:23,199
you want to talk about that language now

01:54:21,119 --> 01:54:25,119
considering simple simple words like the

01:54:23,199 --> 01:54:27,040
bands going to the village i think

01:54:25,119 --> 01:54:29,520
all of us a lot of you are viewers would

01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:32,639
know that in sanskrit it translates to

01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:35,040
purusha gramma the problem is

01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:36,560
that if i replace the order of the words

01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:39,040
in english for example

01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:39,840
village go man the meaning completely

01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:41,760
changes

01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:43,360
in sanskrit because of inflection the

01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:46,480
meaning remains the same

01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:47,119
so what and panani's genius was to

01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:48,639
actually say

01:54:47,119 --> 01:54:50,159
where exactly is this information

01:54:48,639 --> 01:54:52,159
included it's not in the

01:54:50,159 --> 01:54:54,080
purusha it's not in the grammar it's

01:54:52,159 --> 01:54:55,840
actually in the t of gachati

01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:57,119
where exactly it makes that verb

01:54:55,840 --> 01:55:00,239
available

01:54:57,119 --> 01:55:03,599
this specific construct

01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:05,599
and this specific rule applies to almost

01:55:03,599 --> 01:55:07,040
all sectors of indict languages they may

01:55:05,599 --> 01:55:08,800
be different here and there

01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:10,239
but if you look at the pattern in which

01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:12,400
we speak and the way

01:55:10,239 --> 01:55:14,400
the languages have been handed over this

01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:16,159
particular pattern applies to all there

01:55:14,400 --> 01:55:18,080
are certain other patterns which don't

01:55:16,159 --> 01:55:19,599
but the research has been on in

01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:22,239
different sectors i've seen

01:55:19,599 --> 01:55:23,760
colleges we've been we've seen academia

01:55:22,239 --> 01:55:24,400
work on it we've seen researchers work

01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:26,560
on it

01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:28,480
but there are some very very good

01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:29,280
patterns to help us in natural language

01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:30,880
processing

01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:32,719
which we are finding within indic

01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:33,119
languages and that's been a revelation

01:55:32,719 --> 01:55:34,719
so

01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:36,560
i think if more and more people join

01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:37,520
this community of open source they would

01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:39,280
find that

01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:40,719
these patterns would also help them

01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:42,719
solve some of the challenges for natural

01:55:40,719 --> 01:55:45,599
language processing in english as well

01:55:42,719 --> 01:55:47,760
so that's what we're finding out very

01:55:45,599 --> 01:55:51,840
interesting

01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:54,719
got it yeah uh i agree indeed languages

01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:54,719
share uh

01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:58,080
so yeah indeed languages share quite a

01:55:56,960 --> 01:56:01,679
bit in common

01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:03,679
and research research

01:56:01,679 --> 01:56:05,360
developed for one language i think

01:56:03,679 --> 01:56:06,960
there's a significant overlap with what

01:56:05,360 --> 01:56:08,719
you could use for other languages to

01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:12,560
cite a concrete example

01:56:08,719 --> 01:56:12,560
for the malayalam dictionary to work

01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:17,199
i had to i ended up putting metaphor

01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:20,000
which is an english phonetic

01:56:17,199 --> 01:56:22,000
hashing algorithm really simple you uh

01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,040
you take a word elephant apple it'll

01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:25,040
encode it to

01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:26,880
you know two or three letters like apl

01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:28,719
or ebnt

01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:30,560
so the idea is that similar sounding

01:56:28,719 --> 01:56:31,760
words will all hatch to the same set of

01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:33,360
strengths

01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:34,800
it's called metaphor it's available in

01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:36,080
the public domain so that was quoted

01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:38,480
from malayalam

01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:40,639
and uh that's how phonetic search on

01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:44,159
that malayalam dictionary works

01:56:40,639 --> 01:56:47,280
but because the phonetic uh nature of

01:56:44,159 --> 01:56:48,320
uh kannada is extremely similar and uh

01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:51,520
for that matter you know

01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:52,080
in the gujarati etc this was easily

01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:54,320
voted

01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:55,199
overnight to canada and we certainly

01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:58,320
have canada from

01:56:55,199 --> 01:57:00,080
search on color so a lot of

01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:02,080
things that we developed for one indict

01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:04,159
language can be outright applied with

01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:07,440
very minor tweaks and exceptions

01:57:04,159 --> 01:57:09,520
for many other languages the and

01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:11,520
like you said uh i wanted to add one

01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:13,760
thing to what you said earlier there is

01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:14,960
widespread availability of tools like

01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:16,960
for example there is

01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:18,400
google translate for almost all major

01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:20,960
index languages today

01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:21,599
and there's google input tools but these

01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:23,360
are all

01:57:21,599 --> 01:57:25,360
unfortunately proprietary how these

01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:27,119
tools work we don't know

01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:28,400
what are the algorithms that power these

01:57:27,119 --> 01:57:29,520
tools we don't know what are the data

01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:32,159
since they go into it

01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:33,440
we don't know so if that tool disappears

01:57:32,159 --> 01:57:34,239
one day millions of users will be

01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:35,920
handicapped

01:57:34,239 --> 01:57:38,000
that's why it's important for language

01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:41,040
related research and

01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:44,000
data to all come out in the public

01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:47,199
domain and be open source

01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:51,199
yeah makes sense makes sense and so

01:57:47,199 --> 01:57:52,000
uh how would uh you uh if i asked both

01:57:51,199 --> 01:57:55,040
of you that

01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:57,920
you know if our um open source community

01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:58,400
would want to contribute on this front

01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:02,480
uh

01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:05,599
both uh specifically on your projects

01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:06,719
as well as uh you know how should they

01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:09,520
be

01:58:06,719 --> 01:58:10,239
keeping all of this in mind in their own

01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:13,360
efforts

01:58:10,239 --> 01:58:21,679
you know any any advice for

01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:25,920
the folks listening in

01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:29,199
i think uh i'll go first

01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:30,480
so uh all the all the components that

01:58:29,199 --> 01:58:33,599
have gone into building these

01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:33,599
dictionaries you know english

01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:36,960
the data sets themselves part of speed

01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:39,840
stacked

01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:41,760
and the software that runs the website

01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:43,360
this the phonetic algorithms and power

01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:45,119
source these are all

01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:47,599
open source and they're all available on

01:58:45,119 --> 01:58:50,800
github so for someone

01:58:47,599 --> 01:58:52,400
wanting to start to do simple things

01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:54,000
especially surrounding open data and

01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:57,119
dictionaries they could

01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:58,639
tinker with you know uh the data they

01:58:57,119 --> 01:59:00,239
could think of with the code they could

01:58:58,639 --> 01:59:01,040
even use some of these tools to build

01:59:00,239 --> 01:59:03,520
their own little

01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:04,239
local dictionaries for example you could

01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:07,199
very easily

01:59:04,239 --> 01:59:07,920
with minimal effort build a hindi

01:59:07,199 --> 01:59:10,080
technical

01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:11,119
word dictionary it could be 5 000 or 10

01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:13,199
000 words

01:59:11,119 --> 01:59:14,320
so or even a couple thousand words but

01:59:13,199 --> 01:59:16,480
you know technical

01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:17,760
you know scientific mathematical world

01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:19,679
so

01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:21,679
even small efforts like that building

01:59:19,679 --> 01:59:23,040
niche open data dictionaries for

01:59:21,679 --> 01:59:24,239
different languages would be a great

01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:25,679
start so

01:59:24,239 --> 01:59:27,440
there are many things one could do

01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:31,760
without actually getting into proper

01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:34,239
linguistic research

01:59:31,760 --> 01:59:35,040
no i agree with i think i think i'm

01:59:34,239 --> 01:59:37,119
sorry just to

01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:38,880
just to add to one point over here i

01:59:37,119 --> 01:59:40,560
think one of the things is for people to

01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:41,280
actually go and use these projects i

01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:43,360
think

01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:45,440
download them for them find out what are

01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:48,400
some of the things that is going on

01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:49,599
and maybe add on top of it and and

01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:52,080
figure out what's the

01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:53,920
base value at what that is being created

01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:55,840
and i think the moment you add more

01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:57,199
uh the moment you learn more as well

01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:58,000
understanding what's going on and you

01:59:57,199 --> 01:59:59,920
would go into your

01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:02,400
own research small little research on

01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:04,639
the side as well yeah

02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:06,239
makes sense and uh nikhil one thing i

02:00:04,639 --> 02:00:09,599
wanted to touch upon was that

02:00:06,239 --> 02:00:13,360
as you as we think about um making

02:00:09,599 --> 02:00:15,679
uh you know uh programming uh

02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:17,280
or technology more accessible to

02:00:15,679 --> 02:00:20,320
non-english speakers

02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:21,679
uh do we see it as uh

02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:23,520
you know like what you're trying to do

02:00:21,679 --> 02:00:25,520
with bharma where you're enabling

02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:26,880
them to use the language that they're

02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:30,000
familiar with and then

02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:32,239
i guess translating um so that the

02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:33,520
current tools that work with english can

02:00:32,239 --> 02:00:36,960
continue to work

02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:38,639
um do you see it continuing in that form

02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:40,719
do you see us

02:00:38,639 --> 02:00:42,400
do you see this do you see other

02:00:40,719 --> 02:00:45,119
strategies where we use

02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:47,119
no code and low code kind of things and

02:00:45,119 --> 02:00:50,000
more natural language processing which

02:00:47,119 --> 02:00:50,880
does code generation uh or are there

02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:53,119
even other

02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:55,840
strategies to you know make this more

02:00:53,119 --> 02:00:57,280
accessible

02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:58,880
now you're absolutely right richard i

02:00:57,280 --> 02:00:59,679
think it's a mixture of both it's both

02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:01,599
translation

02:00:59,679 --> 02:01:02,960
it's port transliteration but it's also

02:01:01,599 --> 02:01:03,840
about looking at natural language

02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:05,840
processing

02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:07,920
but i think my vision the vision that i

02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:08,560
carry within india is that at the end of

02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:11,599
the day

02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:14,400
on silicon it's just so

02:01:11,599 --> 02:01:15,520
what we've got to do is basically do the

02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:18,000
layer

02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:19,760
and change that entire layer so whether

02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:21,040
it's the layer of compilers it's the

02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:23,599
layer of assembler

02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:25,119
it's even the layer of the os that

02:01:23,599 --> 02:01:26,560
should essentially be changed to

02:01:25,119 --> 02:01:27,520
understand the language in its most

02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:30,239
prime form

02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:32,159
if that happens you can put that as an

02:01:30,239 --> 02:01:34,239
os addendum on anything it could be a

02:01:32,159 --> 02:01:34,960
version of linux it could be freebsd or

02:01:34,239 --> 02:01:37,280
whatever

02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:38,080
but that will really change the impact

02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:40,080
of a language

02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:42,000
and the usage of that language as well

02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:44,639
so while we all say that c

02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:45,199
is the mother or the foundation of all

02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:47,520
in

02:01:45,199 --> 02:01:49,199
you know all programming languages could

02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:51,599
we develop another language

02:01:49,199 --> 02:01:53,280
which is like c but it's basically based

02:01:51,599 --> 02:01:54,719
out of all of these regional language

02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:56,159
structures as well

02:01:54,719 --> 02:01:57,440
could it have a completely different

02:01:56,159 --> 02:01:59,040
structure could it have a completely

02:01:57,440 --> 02:02:01,040
different database structure as well

02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:03,119
so i think those components is something

02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:06,000
which is basically driving this vision

02:02:03,119 --> 02:02:07,440
this work is very very primitive what

02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,920
you know and i would like to call my

02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:09,840
work

02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:11,440
i'm i'm not privy to actually say what

02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:12,880
kalash is doing but it's very very

02:02:11,440 --> 02:02:13,599
primitive it's actually scratching the

02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:15,520
surface

02:02:13,599 --> 02:02:17,599
but the open source community now has

02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:18,159
the ability to actually take this

02:02:17,599 --> 02:02:20,239
forward

02:02:18,159 --> 02:02:21,280
and bring it out in a much more bigger

02:02:20,239 --> 02:02:24,000
and brighter way

02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:25,280
um you know change the layers the osi

02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,800
layers as you call it

02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:30,080
and that will really produce the change

02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:34,000
for the index sector as well

02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:34,400
makes sense and uh what do both of you

02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,880
think

02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:38,080
in terms of you know the overall role

02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:40,960
that open source

02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:44,000
uh plays uh in regards to computer

02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:44,000
literacy in india

02:02:45,599 --> 02:02:48,960
uh i think

02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:53,599
as i said earlier they're having

02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:57,440
considerable

02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:58,000
uh interventions and activism and pushes

02:02:57,440 --> 02:03:00,480
from the

02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:03,280
open source language computing community

02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:06,080
all volunteer based in india

02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:07,440
which we don't really see on the surface

02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:09,840
and thanks to which by

02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:10,560
most indict languages today are properly

02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:13,599
standardized

02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:14,639
unicode there are bi standards managing

02:03:13,599 --> 02:03:17,679
but all

02:03:14,639 --> 02:03:19,599
should have uh indic languages so

02:03:17,679 --> 02:03:21,280
the open source communities are what

02:03:19,599 --> 02:03:23,199
really gave us the indic

02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:25,040
digital you know computing language

02:03:23,199 --> 02:03:26,840
revolution we don't see it because we

02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:29,440
only interface with

02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:30,800
uh the consumer devices and you know

02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:34,000
consumer software

02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:37,119
so i i would say that

02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:39,440
uh the question how can open source help

02:03:37,119 --> 02:03:42,239
uh his mood in the face of open source

02:03:39,440 --> 02:03:45,119
is what really gave us you know this

02:03:42,239 --> 02:03:46,719
this indic languages uh in the digital

02:03:45,119 --> 02:03:49,679
form to begin with

02:03:46,719 --> 02:03:50,000
and going forward also as i said you

02:03:49,679 --> 02:03:52,480
know

02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:53,599
could be simple algorithms could be open

02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:55,599
data sets

02:03:53,599 --> 02:03:57,760
all these building blocks they have to

02:03:55,599 --> 02:03:59,599
be in the public domain for

02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:01,920
true innovation and accessibility to

02:03:59,599 --> 02:04:03,440
happen you can't really build

02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:05,280
if you if you end up building a great

02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:06,480
language translation model and you keep

02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:08,800
it proprietary

02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:11,040
you are holding language hostage from a

02:04:08,800 --> 02:04:15,199
large part of the population

02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:17,040
and and everything is going online

02:04:15,199 --> 02:04:18,000
especially critical government public

02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:20,960
services

02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:22,400
so it's important that all these

02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:24,639
critical public services that are going

02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:25,199
online are accessible in local languages

02:04:24,639 --> 02:04:27,119
too

02:04:25,199 --> 02:04:28,480
for that you need great you know

02:04:27,119 --> 02:04:31,679
publicly accessible

02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:34,320
open building blocks so foss is

02:04:31,679 --> 02:04:35,199
uh highly intertwined and ingrained in

02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:39,280
this whole

02:04:35,199 --> 02:04:42,079
you know moment

02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:44,320
absolutely absolutely nikhil anything

02:04:42,079 --> 02:04:46,000
you'd like to add there

02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:47,360
no no i think i i think kalash has

02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,239
pretty much covered everything i think

02:04:47,360 --> 02:04:50,960
the only

02:04:48,239 --> 02:04:52,560
the um and i think the reason is for

02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:53,920
everyone to see i think the reason we

02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:56,079
are having and discussing this

02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:57,920
today on a github satellite is the

02:04:56,079 --> 02:04:59,760
reason enough for us to say that this is

02:04:57,920 --> 02:05:01,440
the power of open source community

02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:04,239
and that power of open source community

02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:06,960
can actually be fettered in yeah so

02:05:04,239 --> 02:05:09,119
makes sense and i think uh just uh

02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:10,719
touching back on the example that you

02:05:09,119 --> 02:05:12,239
started with nikhil at the beginning of

02:05:10,719 --> 02:05:13,760
our discussion where you know you talked

02:05:12,239 --> 02:05:16,400
about these kids who

02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:16,800
had really come upon this great idea and

02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:19,520
uh

02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:21,840
that helped solved malnutrition and

02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:25,440
really for them to take that idea

02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:26,960
and you know reach a lot more people and

02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:28,880
make a bigger impact really

02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:30,960
it's technology that's going to hold

02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:33,360
them back if they don't get access to it

02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:34,400
and so uh you know that was a great way

02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:36,960
to see that

02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:37,679
if we really want to reach out to all

02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:40,719
those

02:05:37,679 --> 02:05:42,880
uh folks um that are coming up with

02:05:40,719 --> 02:05:44,159
these innovative ideas and really

02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:48,000
empower them

02:05:44,159 --> 02:05:49,119
uh raising that awareness amongst uh you

02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:52,400
know

02:05:49,119 --> 02:05:54,239
both open source community corporations

02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:56,400
everyone has to come together and see

02:05:54,239 --> 02:06:00,960
what we all can do

02:05:56,400 --> 02:06:04,400
in this area to really truly make this

02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:06,400
technology accessible to everyone um so

02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:06,880
it's been uh wonderful talking to both

02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:10,639
of you

02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:11,360
uh it's really um fascinating to hear

02:06:10,639 --> 02:06:14,000
about the

02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:15,440
work that you all have been doing uh i'm

02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:17,119
very very excited

02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:18,639
about the possibilities that are ahead

02:06:17,119 --> 02:06:21,679
of us and

02:06:18,639 --> 02:06:22,719
uh i hope that both at github and all uh

02:06:21,679 --> 02:06:25,280
you know our

02:06:22,719 --> 02:06:26,320
amazing uh open source community that

02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:29,360
we're gonna take away

02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:31,840
some uh important uh you know um

02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:33,360
thoughts back from this and you know as

02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:35,760
we do our own work

02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:37,280
uh we'll be looking at how we can make

02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:40,000
everything that we do

02:06:37,280 --> 02:06:41,679
more accessible and empower more people

02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:43,360
across the world

02:06:41,679 --> 02:06:45,360
thank you both it's been a pleasure

02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:49,520
talking to you today

02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:49,520
thank you thank you thank you thank you

02:06:52,079 --> 02:06:59,280
oh hello and welcome back i'm just uh

02:06:56,159 --> 02:07:01,280
you know getting over from uh all of the

02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:04,000
celebration of holy and all of the

02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:06,880
colors it's it's really nice you know so

02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:08,719
uh do join in with us as well but uh

02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:10,639
before that you know this this session

02:07:08,719 --> 02:07:13,599
was really really nice and i was

02:07:10,639 --> 02:07:14,639
i was watching it and it's so really um

02:07:13,599 --> 02:07:16,960
amazing that

02:07:14,639 --> 02:07:18,639
uh how we are able to bring in all of

02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:22,000
these different languages

02:07:18,639 --> 02:07:23,440
um you know come in and help contribute

02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:26,239
to open source and you know

02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:27,119
really make open source accessible to a

02:07:26,239 --> 02:07:29,280
whole lot of

02:07:27,119 --> 02:07:30,480
other people for whom it might not

02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:33,760
already be

02:07:30,480 --> 02:07:36,000
so um don't forget that you know richard

02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:37,040
kailash and nikhil will be around on get

02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:39,040
up discussions

02:07:37,040 --> 02:07:40,239
so if you have any questions head on

02:07:39,040 --> 02:07:43,360
over to

02:07:40,239 --> 02:07:44,800
github satellite.com discussions that's

02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:47,280
what it is right here

02:07:44,800 --> 02:07:48,239
uh where you can chat with them and have

02:07:47,280 --> 02:07:50,719
a conversation

02:07:48,239 --> 02:07:51,920
on anything that you would want to know

02:07:50,719 --> 02:07:55,119
about

02:07:51,920 --> 02:07:57,520
so um all right so

02:07:55,119 --> 02:07:59,520
before that you know in case you have

02:07:57,520 --> 02:08:02,400
anything that you want to share with us

02:07:59,520 --> 02:08:03,679
what you learned or uh just you know

02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:05,360
how's it going what have been your

02:08:03,679 --> 02:08:08,159
favorite moments etc

02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:08,960
do tweet out to us on hashtag github

02:08:08,159 --> 02:08:11,599
satellite

02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:12,239
and tag us using aggrebinder this

02:08:11,599 --> 02:08:14,480
there's

02:08:12,239 --> 02:08:17,199
quite some good conversations happening

02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:21,360
on twitter github discussions etc

02:08:17,199 --> 02:08:23,360
and uh oh hey anisha you're here

02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:24,400
hey i'm back well how's it how's it

02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:26,800
going you know

02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:28,400
yeah i'm having i'm having i'm having

02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:29,760
quite a good celebration idea you can

02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:31,679
you can see a lot of the colors that

02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:33,520
folks have folks are put in and

02:08:31,679 --> 02:08:35,679
you know just just going a little bit uh

02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:36,480
safe and then it's all confetti all over

02:08:35,679 --> 02:08:38,480
pop but it's

02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:40,000
yeah i see it everywhere yeah i'm

02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:40,880
starting to get it on my face as well

02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,880
now

02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:44,239
it's a lot of fun it's a lot of fun very

02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:47,520
excited nice

02:08:44,239 --> 02:08:48,079
nice all right but let's let's get going

02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:51,280
uh

02:08:48,079 --> 02:08:53,599
you know so uh right now next

02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:54,320
uh we have uh you better don't blink

02:08:53,599 --> 02:08:56,320
anisha

02:08:54,320 --> 02:08:58,000
because well because you'll get colors

02:08:56,320 --> 02:09:00,880
in your eyes but also because

02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:02,800
it's a lightning talk uh which means uh

02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:03,599
you know it's gonna be a super quick

02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:06,280
session

02:09:03,599 --> 02:09:07,760
on ai for web and introduction to

02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:11,199
tensorflow.js

02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:13,040
uh so for this oh yes wow you have a

02:09:11,199 --> 02:09:15,520
nice emoji out there

02:09:13,040 --> 02:09:16,400
all right so for this we have shivai

02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:19,840
lamba who is

02:09:16,400 --> 02:09:21,760
a production engineer at uh layer 5

02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:23,520
who's going to be giving an introduction

02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:25,199
to tensorflow.js

02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:27,840
so remember that you know if you have

02:09:25,199 --> 02:09:31,199
any questions head on over to

02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:33,520
get satellite dot com slash discussions

02:09:31,199 --> 02:09:34,239
and you know while watching anisha and i

02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:36,239
will have

02:09:34,239 --> 02:09:37,840
a little more of this celebration and

02:09:36,239 --> 02:09:39,840
colors going on as well

02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:41,430
so all right see you all folks soon and

02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:44,579
then welcome shiva

02:09:41,430 --> 02:09:44,579
[Music]

02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:49,760
hey

02:09:47,760 --> 02:09:51,520
everyone who are watching uh this

02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:54,239
lighting talk i'm so i

02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:55,119
am currently a tensorflow js sig member

02:09:54,239 --> 02:09:57,520
and working group

02:09:55,119 --> 02:09:58,159
member as well and i was also previously

02:09:57,520 --> 02:09:59,920
a google

02:09:58,159 --> 02:10:01,760
tensorflow code and inventor and i'm

02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:02,719
currently also a production engineer at

02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:04,560
layer 5.

02:10:02,719 --> 02:10:06,159
so the talk of my uh lightning

02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:06,480
presentation is machine learning for the

02:10:06,159 --> 02:10:09,040
web

02:10:06,480 --> 02:10:10,400
and introduction to tensorflow.js so

02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:13,280
without wasting further ado

02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:14,960
let's get started the first question is

02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:17,280
you know people ask is why

02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:18,960
machine learning in javascript so for

02:10:17,280 --> 02:10:20,800
the one of the first reasons that

02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:22,159
we want to first introduce is what

02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:24,000
exactly is tensorflow

02:10:22,159 --> 02:10:25,679
so tensorflow is a free and open source

02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:27,360
library that is created by the team at

02:10:25,679 --> 02:10:28,560
google and is used for a lot of

02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:29,360
different kind of machine learning

02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:31,440
applications

02:10:29,360 --> 02:10:32,560
particularly in deep learning and neural

02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:34,719
networks and

02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:35,760
the question is that why introduce

02:10:34,719 --> 02:10:38,000
machine learning

02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:39,679
in javascript at the same time so

02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:41,280
javascript actually has a lot of

02:10:39,679 --> 02:10:42,079
different unique selling points when it

02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:44,320
comes to

02:10:42,079 --> 02:10:46,000
consideration of the type language

02:10:44,320 --> 02:10:48,480
because of its lower latency

02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:50,480
about user privacy and then also writing

02:10:48,480 --> 02:10:51,079
code in just one single language that is

02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:54,800
using

02:10:51,079 --> 02:10:56,320
tensorflow.js right so uh and again one

02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:57,920
of the biggest reasons is that

02:10:56,320 --> 02:11:00,560
we can use machine learning with

02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:03,119
javascript in any kind of an environment

02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:04,880
javascript is the world's most popular

02:11:03,119 --> 02:11:05,760
programming language and it finds its

02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:08,079
use in

02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:09,199
the browsers and the servers in the

02:11:08,079 --> 02:11:11,599
desktops in

02:11:09,199 --> 02:11:13,119
mobile computing devices and also in iot

02:11:11,599 --> 02:11:15,440
that is internet of things devices

02:11:13,119 --> 02:11:17,119
and to sort of note down a few examples

02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:17,599
of one of the most popular browsers that

02:11:17,119 --> 02:11:20,480
we use

02:11:17,599 --> 02:11:22,079
like chrome safari mozilla or uh running

02:11:20,480 --> 02:11:22,960
your code on the server side using

02:11:22,079 --> 02:11:24,960
node.js

02:11:22,960 --> 02:11:26,480
or having like a mobile based

02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:27,840
application uh built using a

02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:30,079
cross-platform platform like

02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:31,199
react native or having a desktop based

02:11:30,079 --> 02:11:33,199
uh

02:11:31,199 --> 02:11:34,800
development environment like electron js

02:11:33,199 --> 02:11:37,040
or using node.js with

02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:38,480
raspberry pi to create really wonderful

02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:40,480
iot based devices

02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:42,000
javascript has support for all of these

02:11:40,480 --> 02:11:44,239
different spectrum of devices

02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:45,119
and you can introduce machine learning

02:11:44,239 --> 02:11:46,800
with javascript

02:11:45,119 --> 02:11:48,400
now one of the biggest reasons why we

02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:49,199
want to do that is for creative

02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:52,480
professionals

02:11:49,199 --> 02:11:53,679
who are only learning javascript it can

02:11:52,480 --> 02:11:55,360
be very difficult for them to

02:11:53,679 --> 02:11:57,199
probably learn another type of language

02:11:55,360 --> 02:11:58,079
like python and introduce machine

02:11:57,199 --> 02:12:00,560
learning models

02:11:58,079 --> 02:12:01,280
in a cross-platform application or that

02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:04,000
uses both

02:12:01,280 --> 02:12:05,920
python and also uses javascript so

02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:08,079
because of the versatility of javascript

02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:09,520
it finds great use to include machine

02:12:08,079 --> 02:12:09,840
learning in all of these different kind

02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:12,159
of

02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:13,679
devices and developer experiences at the

02:12:12,159 --> 02:12:16,400
same time

02:12:13,679 --> 02:12:18,719
and the biggest fundamental of the

02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:21,040
tensorflow.js library is that we can

02:12:18,719 --> 02:12:21,760
either use the existing models that are

02:12:21,040 --> 02:12:24,000
pre-built

02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:26,000
or we can create our own or we can also

02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:29,119
use the concept of transfer learning

02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:31,679
to retrain our existing data

02:12:29,119 --> 02:12:32,239
sets with these models at the same time

02:12:31,679 --> 02:12:34,560
and

02:12:32,239 --> 02:12:36,079
coming on to uh you know because of the

02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:38,960
versatility of javascript

02:12:36,079 --> 02:12:40,480
we can use uh javascript and machine

02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:40,960
learning in all of the other different

02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:43,199
type

02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:44,800
of type of applications that can be used

02:12:43,199 --> 02:12:46,079
with javascript so that includes things

02:12:44,800 --> 02:12:47,760
like augmented reality

02:12:46,079 --> 02:12:49,119
or let's say gesture based interactions

02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:50,800
or sound recognition

02:12:49,119 --> 02:12:52,560
and all of these different types of

02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:55,679
applications that we build

02:12:52,560 --> 02:12:56,000
in uh the web platforms can be coupled

02:12:55,679 --> 02:12:57,679
with

02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:59,920
tensorflows to create machine learning

02:12:57,679 --> 02:13:01,679
experiences that are going to

02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:03,280
uh blow your mind with some of the

02:13:01,679 --> 02:13:05,599
examples that we'll be showing you

02:13:03,280 --> 02:13:07,040
so the first category of uh the such

02:13:05,599 --> 02:13:07,599
kind of models are the pre-trained

02:13:07,040 --> 02:13:09,280
models

02:13:07,599 --> 02:13:11,199
now these are completely easy to use

02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:13,280
javascript classes that have been built

02:13:11,199 --> 02:13:15,360
and are completely open sourced are can

02:13:13,280 --> 02:13:17,840
be used with a single line of code

02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:19,280
uh by embedding that to your javascript

02:13:17,840 --> 02:13:21,280
based project at the same time

02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:22,400
and there are many situations when you

02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:25,520
might not need

02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:27,599
like to use uh or create like a

02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:29,520
specific model and you can directly just

02:13:27,599 --> 02:13:31,040
use some of the previous models for

02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:33,040
small applications that we're trying to

02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:34,800
build and a few examples of

02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:36,639
those include things like image

02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:38,320
classification object detection body

02:13:36,639 --> 02:13:40,560
segmentation pose estimation

02:13:38,320 --> 02:13:41,440
and also things related to nlp like text

02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:43,520
toxicity

02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:45,360
or for example let's say speech commands

02:13:43,520 --> 02:13:47,440
all of those come in handy and

02:13:45,360 --> 02:13:49,280
to visit these models you can simply go

02:13:47,440 --> 02:13:51,520
to tensorflow.org

02:13:49,280 --> 02:13:52,400
js slash models and you'll find the

02:13:51,520 --> 02:13:53,920
github links

02:13:52,400 --> 02:13:56,239
for all of these different models at the

02:13:53,920 --> 02:13:58,480
same time now

02:13:56,239 --> 02:14:00,239
a few examples of these include uh for

02:13:58,480 --> 02:14:01,840
example object recognition that is one

02:14:00,239 --> 02:14:03,840
of the most fundamental

02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:06,079
deep learning or machine learning based

02:14:03,840 --> 02:14:08,320
uh projects that can be taken up and

02:14:06,079 --> 02:14:09,760
koch isd which is a really popular uh

02:14:08,320 --> 02:14:12,639
object uh recognition

02:14:09,760 --> 02:14:14,800
model uh also available in tensorflow.js

02:14:12,639 --> 02:14:15,360
and it can be trained up to 90 different

02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:18,159
classes

02:14:15,360 --> 02:14:19,520
so as you can see in this uh picture

02:14:18,159 --> 02:14:21,440
that uh we have a

02:14:19,520 --> 02:14:23,280
a picture of two dogs and it can

02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:25,840
actually create bounding boxes

02:14:23,280 --> 02:14:27,679
on these dogs images of these dogs and

02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:28,400
give a really great confidence at the

02:14:27,679 --> 02:14:31,760
same time

02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:34,079
to the pixels so it's really great in

02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:35,520
doing it quick and also is highly

02:14:34,079 --> 02:14:37,520
accurate at the same time

02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:39,520
now there's another example of a face

02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:40,079
mesh now face mesh is a model that is

02:14:39,520 --> 02:14:41,920
just

02:14:40,079 --> 02:14:43,159
three megabytes in size and it actually

02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:46,400
recognizes over

02:14:43,159 --> 02:14:48,639
468 different landmarks on your face and

02:14:46,400 --> 02:14:49,599
uh again as you can see that it's really

02:14:48,639 --> 02:14:52,639
popular and

02:14:49,599 --> 02:14:54,639
being used right now in production in uh

02:14:52,639 --> 02:14:55,679
in places like l'oreal which you can see

02:14:54,639 --> 02:14:57,760
on the right-hand side

02:14:55,679 --> 02:14:59,679
uh being used in uh production

02:14:57,760 --> 02:15:00,079
environments and uh being actually used

02:14:59,679 --> 02:15:02,159
in

02:15:00,079 --> 02:15:04,320
products that are ready to go and ready

02:15:02,159 --> 02:15:06,079
to ship as and when required

02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:08,079
then there's another uh model that we

02:15:06,079 --> 02:15:10,000
have uh that basically is the

02:15:08,079 --> 02:15:12,239
body segmentation that can basically

02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:14,800
distinguish 24 different body areas

02:15:12,239 --> 02:15:17,119
in human bodies and it can also do that

02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:18,000
in real time and also across multiple

02:15:17,119 --> 02:15:19,840
different bodies

02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:21,679
so there's this need it doesn't need to

02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:22,159
be just one single body as you can see

02:15:21,679 --> 02:15:23,360
in this

02:15:22,159 --> 02:15:25,199
video there are three different

02:15:23,360 --> 02:15:27,199
individuals whose bodies are being

02:15:25,199 --> 02:15:29,679
segmented as compared to the background

02:15:27,199 --> 02:15:30,480
in real time and again without any

02:15:29,679 --> 02:15:33,599
performance

02:15:30,480 --> 02:15:34,880
overheads at all now with a bit of

02:15:33,599 --> 02:15:36,960
creativity we can

02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:38,880
emulate a lot of different superpowers

02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:41,760
using tensorflow.js at the same time

02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:42,400
and just to sort of show you examples of

02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:45,040
cross

02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:46,320
uh development applications over here

02:15:45,040 --> 02:15:48,400
there's a person

02:15:46,320 --> 02:15:50,159
who's from a community a tensorflow js

02:15:48,400 --> 02:15:51,599
community in the united states has

02:15:50,159 --> 02:15:54,560
created this amazing

02:15:51,599 --> 02:15:56,079
laser application using webgl shaders

02:15:54,560 --> 02:15:58,320
and with tensorflow.js

02:15:56,079 --> 02:15:59,520
and these are just some of the examples

02:15:58,320 --> 02:16:01,520
that you know we can think of

02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:02,960
to create some kind of unique creative

02:16:01,520 --> 02:16:04,880
applications then

02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:06,719
there is a jason mays who is a

02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:07,360
tensorflow.js developer advocate at

02:16:06,719 --> 02:16:10,719
google

02:16:07,360 --> 02:16:13,119
is using a combination of webrtc a frame

02:16:10,719 --> 02:16:15,360
that is uh augmented reality 3js

02:16:13,119 --> 02:16:16,800
and also tensorflow.js to teleport

02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:18,639
himself to another

02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:20,400
environment by using a combination of

02:16:18,639 --> 02:16:22,800
all of these different three uh

02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:24,000
different uh technologies and combining

02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:26,159
them very seamlessly

02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:27,840
to create really fun applications now

02:16:26,159 --> 02:16:28,400
there's another one that was created by

02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:31,119
jason

02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:33,200
was a real-time clothing size estimation

02:16:31,119 --> 02:16:36,000
that uses the body segmentation model

02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:37,200
and can provide you the details of your

02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:40,319
body size by this

02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:40,800
scanning your entire body and within the

02:16:40,319 --> 02:16:43,040
next

02:16:40,800 --> 02:16:45,359
10-15 minutes it can provide you a very

02:16:43,040 --> 02:16:47,280
quick uh

02:16:45,359 --> 02:16:48,800
body size estimation for your so that

02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:51,599
you this could be used

02:16:48,800 --> 02:16:52,880
probably uh in uh sites like amazon or

02:16:51,599 --> 02:16:54,960
other kind of uh

02:16:52,880 --> 02:16:56,800
real world applications or when it comes

02:16:54,960 --> 02:16:58,960
to any kind of estimation that needs

02:16:56,800 --> 02:17:00,080
so not just related to the closing size

02:16:58,960 --> 02:17:02,479
at the same time

02:17:00,080 --> 02:17:04,240
now the idea is that we can combine

02:17:02,479 --> 02:17:06,880
different types of tech

02:17:04,240 --> 02:17:08,559
with uh the tensorflow.js and again this

02:17:06,880 --> 02:17:11,040
shows a really great example

02:17:08,559 --> 02:17:11,760
where basically we are using web xr that

02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:13,439
is uh

02:17:11,760 --> 02:17:14,960
the mixed reality and we are also using

02:17:13,439 --> 02:17:18,080
webgl to create this

02:17:14,960 --> 02:17:19,920
3d uh rendering of an augmented reality

02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:21,840
uh application where for example which

02:17:19,920 --> 02:17:24,319
sort of scans an image and creates

02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:25,120
a real-world model of an augmented

02:17:24,319 --> 02:17:27,920
reality model

02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:29,760
of this statue right so the idea is that

02:17:27,920 --> 02:17:30,719
we can combine different types of

02:17:29,760 --> 02:17:33,359
technologies

02:17:30,719 --> 02:17:34,559
uh that are supported in web very

02:17:33,359 --> 02:17:36,479
seamlessly and

02:17:34,559 --> 02:17:38,080
again the integration is usually very

02:17:36,479 --> 02:17:40,719
simple at the same time

02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:42,559
now the second part is using transfer

02:17:40,719 --> 02:17:44,399
learning so basically retraining

02:17:42,559 --> 02:17:46,080
some of the existing models that we have

02:17:44,399 --> 02:17:47,040
to work with your own data to sort of

02:17:46,080 --> 02:17:49,519
customize

02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:51,359
those uh models to your own data to

02:17:49,519 --> 02:17:52,960
provide you better accuracy and better

02:17:51,359 --> 02:17:54,719
functionality at the same time so

02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:56,080
transfer learning is essentially taking

02:17:54,719 --> 02:17:58,960
an existing model and

02:17:56,080 --> 02:18:00,479
use it to basically uh apply to similar

02:17:58,960 --> 02:18:02,160
kind of problems or in

02:18:00,479 --> 02:18:03,760
some kind of domain such as probably

02:18:02,160 --> 02:18:06,719
like you know like say recognizing

02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:08,160
a cat instead of a dog right so again uh

02:18:06,719 --> 02:18:09,599
there are two different ways in which

02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:10,240
you can use the transfer learning one of

02:18:09,599 --> 02:18:12,399
the most

02:18:10,240 --> 02:18:14,080
easiest ones is teachable machines so

02:18:12,399 --> 02:18:16,240
basically this is super easy

02:18:14,080 --> 02:18:18,160
way to actually use transfer learning

02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:19,200
and it's a completely web-based platform

02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:21,760
that allows you to

02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:22,960
either do things like object recognition

02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:26,240
post estimations

02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:26,960
or things on audio so it's very simple

02:18:26,240 --> 02:18:30,080
uh you just

02:18:26,960 --> 02:18:32,399
take an input you provide uh classes and

02:18:30,080 --> 02:18:33,760
the examples of those using video or

02:18:32,399 --> 02:18:36,080
audio or images

02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:36,960
and then you simply just put it on train

02:18:36,080 --> 02:18:40,080
and as you can see

02:18:36,960 --> 02:18:40,479
that it provides you uh in real time uh

02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:43,120
the

02:18:40,479 --> 02:18:43,760
uh predictions and that predictions can

02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:45,679
also

02:18:43,760 --> 02:18:47,120
be exported and can be used with your

02:18:45,679 --> 02:18:50,000
web application either

02:18:47,120 --> 02:18:50,479
using uh the javascript models or using

02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,240
uh

02:18:50,479 --> 02:18:54,000
let's say a tensorflow lite and any

02:18:52,240 --> 02:18:55,679
other kind of different tensorflow

02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:58,559
embeddings that we can think of

02:18:55,679 --> 02:19:00,240
and if your data is in gigabytes or if

02:18:58,559 --> 02:19:02,399
you want to create a production ready

02:19:00,240 --> 02:19:04,080
model we can also use the cloud automl

02:19:02,399 --> 02:19:04,960
that basically lets you train custom

02:19:04,080 --> 02:19:07,599
engine models

02:19:04,960 --> 02:19:08,719
and if you have data in more than

02:19:07,599 --> 02:19:10,960
gigabytes in size

02:19:08,719 --> 02:19:13,120
it can simply just use this and we can

02:19:10,960 --> 02:19:15,040
deploy that directly to tensorflow.js

02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:16,639
once we deploy it it creates basically

02:19:15,040 --> 02:19:20,559
the small.json file

02:19:16,639 --> 02:19:23,200
that essentially has uh the entire uh

02:19:20,559 --> 02:19:23,599
model of how it works and we can use uh

02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:25,599
that

02:19:23,599 --> 02:19:26,719
simply with our application at the same

02:19:25,599 --> 02:19:28,719
time and

02:19:26,719 --> 02:19:30,800
this is a very small example of a code

02:19:28,719 --> 02:19:31,920
so in the first two lines you see is

02:19:30,800 --> 02:19:34,080
what we have imported

02:19:31,920 --> 02:19:35,359
the tensorflow.js library and also the

02:19:34,080 --> 02:19:37,519
automl library

02:19:35,359 --> 02:19:38,639
uh in this third line you see we have

02:19:37,519 --> 02:19:41,200
simply just uh

02:19:38,639 --> 02:19:41,760
taken an image of a daisy that is a

02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:44,000
flower

02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:45,599
and we have just given uh it the id of

02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:47,840
daisy for the image

02:19:45,599 --> 02:19:50,000
and then the script that you see is not

02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:50,800
more than five lines in length and what

02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,960
we do in this

02:19:50,800 --> 02:19:54,399
uh what we do in this is that we have

02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:56,080
created an async function

02:19:54,399 --> 02:19:57,600
because uh the machine learning models

02:19:56,080 --> 02:19:59,120
take some time to load so

02:19:57,600 --> 02:20:01,040
we would want to make the predictions

02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:03,040
only after the model has been loaded

02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:04,720
so what we do is that we use an async

02:20:03,040 --> 02:20:05,439
function or an asynchronous function in

02:20:04,720 --> 02:20:08,240
javascript

02:20:05,439 --> 02:20:08,960
to first load our image classification

02:20:08,240 --> 02:20:11,280
model

02:20:08,960 --> 02:20:12,399
from our model.json file that has the

02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:14,080
characteristics or

02:20:12,399 --> 02:20:16,160
basically the dependencies of our

02:20:14,080 --> 02:20:16,560
machine learning model and then we just

02:20:16,160 --> 02:20:18,720
uh

02:20:16,560 --> 02:20:19,680
use the const image to get the document

02:20:18,720 --> 02:20:21,920
by id for

02:20:19,680 --> 02:20:22,880
our flower so we can get that particular

02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:24,800
image id

02:20:22,880 --> 02:20:26,319
and then what we do is that we simply

02:20:24,800 --> 02:20:28,640
run the predictions uh

02:20:26,319 --> 02:20:30,319
using this and we use the classify to

02:20:28,640 --> 02:20:32,240
basically classify okay what type

02:20:30,319 --> 02:20:34,640
of flower is it so it will basically

02:20:32,240 --> 02:20:38,080
tell you what is uh the classification

02:20:34,640 --> 02:20:39,760
or the label of the image right and

02:20:38,080 --> 02:20:42,399
the probably the last one and the most

02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:43,359
powerful one is writing your own code in

02:20:42,399 --> 02:20:45,520
tensorflow.js

02:20:43,359 --> 02:20:47,439
so tensorflow.js basically provides you

02:20:45,520 --> 02:20:48,960
two different types of apis one is the

02:20:47,439 --> 02:20:51,359
layers api that is

02:20:48,960 --> 02:20:52,399
built similar to how keras works on top

02:20:51,359 --> 02:20:54,240
of tensorflow

02:20:52,399 --> 02:20:56,399
and that allows you to use some high

02:20:54,240 --> 02:20:58,800
level functions but we also have the

02:20:56,399 --> 02:21:00,080
ops api or that is the lower level api

02:20:58,800 --> 02:21:01,439
where you can also uh

02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:03,439
you know change the mathematical

02:21:01,439 --> 02:21:05,840
functions like the linear algebra

02:21:03,439 --> 02:21:06,800
uh functions in your code that provides

02:21:05,840 --> 02:21:08,640
you a lot more

02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:11,040
flexibility and functionality when it

02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:13,200
comes to changing or writing your own

02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:14,399
code now this sort of gives you the

02:21:13,200 --> 02:21:16,640
architecture of

02:21:14,399 --> 02:21:18,479
what we have discussed so far so the top

02:21:16,640 --> 02:21:20,640
level is the pre-built models

02:21:18,479 --> 02:21:22,240
the next one is leds api that's similar

02:21:20,640 --> 02:21:24,479
to how kira's has been built

02:21:22,240 --> 02:21:26,319
and finally we have at the most low

02:21:24,479 --> 02:21:28,080
level the ops api

02:21:26,319 --> 02:21:29,439
and this basically allows it to run

02:21:28,080 --> 02:21:31,439
either on the client side

02:21:29,439 --> 02:21:33,200
or on the server side or the client side

02:21:31,439 --> 02:21:34,000
with basically is the interaction with

02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:36,720
the browser

02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:38,240
we can have the support for the cpu or

02:21:36,720 --> 02:21:40,880
webgl that is web accelerated

02:21:38,240 --> 02:21:42,160
graphics or we have webassembly that use

02:21:40,880 --> 02:21:43,840
as the backend for

02:21:42,160 --> 02:21:45,680
powering the machine learning models in

02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:47,280
the client side and we also have the

02:21:45,680 --> 02:21:48,160
server side that basically runs in

02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:49,840
node.js

02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:52,240
that is the tensorflow cpu or the

02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:53,040
tensorflow gpu basically using the cuda

02:21:52,240 --> 02:21:55,359
cores and

02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:56,640
uh the uh same power that python based

02:21:55,359 --> 02:21:59,760
models can be using

02:21:56,640 --> 02:22:01,439
at the same time and as you can see that

02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:03,120
we can either use some of the pre-built

02:22:01,439 --> 02:22:05,200
models that are there uh in

02:22:03,120 --> 02:22:06,720
tensorflow so if you have a python based

02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:08,399
model we can use the tensorflow saved

02:22:06,720 --> 02:22:10,640
model to be directly imported

02:22:08,399 --> 02:22:12,080
in the node.js in the server side or we

02:22:10,640 --> 02:22:13,280
can use the tfts converter that

02:22:12,080 --> 02:22:14,479
basically converts

02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:16,640
a machine learning model written in

02:22:14,479 --> 02:22:19,359
python to a one written in

02:22:16,640 --> 02:22:21,120
uh javascript and again as you can see

02:22:19,359 --> 02:22:22,880
from the model that uh from the model

02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:24,000
inference basically this is a mobile net

02:22:22,880 --> 02:22:25,359
model that we have

02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,960
and as you can see the difference

02:22:25,359 --> 02:22:27,840
between the performance of python based

02:22:26,960 --> 02:22:29,920
model and

02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:32,000
like a javascript based model is very

02:22:29,920 --> 02:22:32,560
minuscule and the difference is not that

02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:35,040
much

02:22:32,560 --> 02:22:35,840
right and uh again this shows another

02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:39,200
example of

02:22:35,840 --> 02:22:39,520
an uh of like um an nlp based model that

02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:41,680
is

02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:43,840
the distilbert model and as you can see

02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:43,840
that

02:22:44,080 --> 02:22:47,359
this is actually better as compared to

02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:49,120
the one that we see in python

02:22:47,359 --> 02:22:50,800
now there are also five different you

02:22:49,120 --> 02:22:52,560
know super uh

02:22:50,800 --> 02:22:54,560
powers that you get with the client side

02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:56,560
so one of the biggest one is privacy

02:22:54,560 --> 02:22:58,560
you get lower latency because we're not

02:22:56,560 --> 02:22:59,120
having a dedicated server we get a lower

02:22:58,560 --> 02:23:01,200
cost

02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:02,240
and again interactivity at the same time

02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:04,080
and also we

02:23:02,240 --> 02:23:06,240
if you're using it on the server side

02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:08,640
then you basically get the power of

02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:09,439
javascript just in time compiler or we

02:23:08,640 --> 02:23:11,200
can also just

02:23:09,439 --> 02:23:12,800
write in this one particular language

02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:14,560
and of course we can run

02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:15,920
models that are much more powerful as

02:23:14,560 --> 02:23:18,720
compared to the client side because

02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:19,280
of the dedicated cpu and gpu power that

02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:22,080
comes

02:23:19,280 --> 02:23:22,399
with uh node.js so these are some of the

02:23:22,080 --> 02:23:24,240
uh

02:23:22,399 --> 02:23:25,520
server-side benefits at the same time

02:23:24,240 --> 02:23:27,280
now just to uh

02:23:25,520 --> 02:23:28,399
share some of the resources uh basically

02:23:27,280 --> 02:23:30,560
you can visit all of these different

02:23:28,399 --> 02:23:33,920
links the website tensorflow.org

02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:35,920
js and the models on testflow.org

02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:37,520
models and again you can visit all these

02:23:35,920 --> 02:23:39,120
different links to get started with

02:23:37,520 --> 02:23:40,960
tensorflow.js at the same time

02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:42,880
and uh you can join the community by

02:23:40,960 --> 02:23:44,160
using a hashtag made with this and you

02:23:42,880 --> 02:23:47,040
can follow this on twitter

02:23:44,160 --> 02:23:47,520
and on uh links like linkedin and again

02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:49,520
uh

02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:51,120
thank you so much for uh staying in

02:23:49,520 --> 02:23:52,399
touch and you can follow me on these

02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:55,120
links to get started

02:23:52,399 --> 02:23:58,399
again thank you so much for uh seeing

02:23:55,120 --> 02:23:58,399
and i hope that you like the

02:23:58,840 --> 02:24:01,840
presentation

02:24:02,720 --> 02:24:07,040
wow that was literally literally a

02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:09,520
lightning talk you know i

02:24:07,040 --> 02:24:11,920
i had to i had to just like yes all

02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:14,960
right i got it now you know

02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:17,520
that was that was really nice one and um

02:24:14,960 --> 02:24:19,439
uh folks don't forget that in case you

02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:22,399
have any questions for shivay

02:24:19,439 --> 02:24:23,520
you can head over to getupsatellite.com

02:24:22,399 --> 02:24:25,680
discussions

02:24:23,520 --> 02:24:27,120
where you can find him answer any of the

02:24:25,680 --> 02:24:30,399
questions that you might have

02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:32,800
around tfjs you know so

02:24:30,399 --> 02:24:34,240
what do you think anisha outside of all

02:24:32,800 --> 02:24:35,760
of these colors you know i'm really

02:24:34,240 --> 02:24:37,600
liking it you know it's

02:24:35,760 --> 02:24:39,280
it's it's a nice celebration you you

02:24:37,600 --> 02:24:40,840
have some nice stuff going on over there

02:24:39,280 --> 02:24:43,840
too

02:24:40,840 --> 02:24:43,840
yes

02:24:47,870 --> 02:24:52,220
[Laughter]

02:24:53,359 --> 02:24:57,439
all right so what do we have coming up

02:24:56,160 --> 02:24:59,439
next to nisha you know

02:24:57,439 --> 02:25:00,640
we had one lightning talk back to it's

02:24:59,439 --> 02:25:03,600
tensorflow.js

02:25:00,640 --> 02:25:05,760
what's next yes so you know what we have

02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:07,280
another second lightning tool coming up

02:25:05,760 --> 02:25:09,840
which is the world's most

02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:10,560
elaborate ci workflow for an angular

02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:13,520
library

02:25:10,560 --> 02:25:14,479
and um we'll have lars jarrett brink

02:25:13,520 --> 02:25:17,760
nilsson who

02:25:14,479 --> 02:25:18,319
is a front-end architect um at systemate

02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:20,560
as

02:25:18,319 --> 02:25:21,680
um he's also a tech writer speaker and a

02:25:20,560 --> 02:25:23,600
microsoft mvp

02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:24,880
wow that's that's a lot of stuff that

02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:26,960
he's involved in which is

02:25:24,880 --> 02:25:29,040
fantastic and don't forget happening

02:25:26,960 --> 02:25:31,200
over on the devops channel right now

02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:33,200
is the workflow dispatch automation for

02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:34,640
the past present and future as well

02:25:33,200 --> 02:25:36,560
so you don't want to miss that but you

02:25:34,640 --> 02:25:38,080
know you want to hang around in our open

02:25:36,560 --> 02:25:41,359
source channel with myself

02:25:38,080 --> 02:25:43,600
anisha and karen um where we've got

02:25:41,359 --> 02:25:45,520
loads more things coming up um so stay

02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:49,760
tuned for all of that stuff as well

02:25:45,520 --> 02:25:53,840
so last are you there take it away

02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:53,840
hey lars

02:25:56,140 --> 02:25:59,410
[Music]

02:26:00,560 --> 02:26:06,800
hello what a lovely day i'm lars brink

02:26:04,319 --> 02:26:08,160
from systemmate and denmark and today

02:26:06,800 --> 02:26:10,560
i'm going to be sharing

02:26:08,160 --> 02:26:13,680
how we applied github actions to a

02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:13,680
library i'm maintaining

02:26:15,760 --> 02:26:20,479
so this is about a library called

02:26:18,840 --> 02:26:22,319
lumberjack

02:26:20,479 --> 02:26:24,319
and let's see a few features of that

02:26:22,319 --> 02:26:25,120
library it's a logging library for

02:26:24,319 --> 02:26:27,680
angular

02:26:25,120 --> 02:26:28,560
it has six configurable logging levels

02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:31,040
very robust

02:26:28,560 --> 02:26:32,080
error handling and it has a plugin based

02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:33,600
architecture

02:26:32,080 --> 02:26:36,399
as you see on the right hand side of the

02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:38,240
screen your application is communicating

02:26:36,399 --> 02:26:41,200
with the lumberjack api

02:26:38,240 --> 02:26:42,560
and behind that is one or more log

02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:46,000
drivers

02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:48,160
and to demonstrate that plug-in

02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:50,000
architecture built into the library has

02:26:48,160 --> 02:26:51,760
two common drivers

02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:54,080
a browser console driver that will

02:26:51,760 --> 02:26:58,240
display the logs in the browser console

02:26:54,080 --> 02:27:01,439
and an http log driver that will

02:26:58,240 --> 02:27:03,920
use your backend with a simple interface

02:27:01,439 --> 02:27:06,240
and the nice thing is that the community

02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:10,319
provides more drivers for example for

02:27:06,240 --> 02:27:12,640
azure application insights and google

02:27:10,319 --> 02:27:15,359
firestore and you can even build your

02:27:12,640 --> 02:27:17,600
own that fits your project which is

02:27:15,359 --> 02:27:19,600
relatively straightforward and the

02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:21,359
library also comes with what's known as

02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:23,600
angular schematics which is used for

02:27:21,359 --> 02:27:25,920
code generation and code mods

02:27:23,600 --> 02:27:27,920
and most importantly for today's talk it

02:27:25,920 --> 02:27:31,359
has verified cross-version

02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:33,600
angular compatibility that means that

02:27:31,359 --> 02:27:35,359
we support multiple major and minor

02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:38,720
versions of angular

02:27:35,359 --> 02:27:42,080
from one major version of lumberjack

02:27:38,720 --> 02:27:42,080
version two point x right now

02:27:42,240 --> 02:27:46,160
a bit more about lumberjack we have six

02:27:44,800 --> 02:27:48,479
d6 log levels

02:27:46,160 --> 02:27:50,160
and angle has the concept of development

02:27:48,479 --> 02:27:52,000
mode and production mode

02:27:50,160 --> 02:27:53,840
in development mode all the log levels

02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:56,479
will be active by default

02:27:53,840 --> 02:27:58,479
in production mode the debug and trace

02:27:56,479 --> 02:28:00,319
levels are disabled

02:27:58,479 --> 02:28:01,680
of course this can be overridden using

02:28:00,319 --> 02:28:03,840
configuration

02:28:01,680 --> 02:28:06,160
even to the point that you can configure

02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:09,600
it on the log driver itself

02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:09,600
different from the other lock drivers

02:28:09,920 --> 02:28:13,520
so we wanted this cross cross-version

02:28:11,600 --> 02:28:15,439
compatibility with angular type script

02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:18,319
and related dependencies

02:28:15,439 --> 02:28:20,160
um so we looked for github actions to

02:28:18,319 --> 02:28:21,600
solve this problem

02:28:20,160 --> 02:28:23,200
this is the problem we're trying to

02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:24,960
solve as you can see here in the

02:28:23,200 --> 02:28:26,240
right hand side we have a compatibility

02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:28,319
matrix between

02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:29,680
angular cli angular node.js and

02:28:28,319 --> 02:28:31,359
typescript

02:28:29,680 --> 02:28:33,120
there's eight different versions of

02:28:31,359 --> 02:28:36,000
angular supporting

02:28:33,120 --> 02:28:37,280
six versions of typescript two major

02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:39,359
node.js versions

02:28:37,280 --> 02:28:40,640
and that's 30 possible combination of

02:28:39,359 --> 02:28:43,200
dependencies

02:28:40,640 --> 02:28:44,080
so how could we solve this maybe a

02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:46,960
project per

02:28:44,080 --> 02:28:47,920
combination with a demo application

02:28:46,960 --> 02:28:51,359
maybe some unit

02:28:47,920 --> 02:28:51,600
integration or end-to-end test this was

02:28:51,359 --> 02:28:53,439
an

02:28:51,600 --> 02:28:55,359
initial stable version of our library

02:28:53,439 --> 02:28:57,840
and we thought this could quickly become

02:28:55,359 --> 02:28:59,600
unmaintainable because

02:28:57,840 --> 02:29:02,000
several versions of angle are released

02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:04,880
each year

02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:06,800
so the solution was we wanted to use the

02:29:04,880 --> 02:29:09,760
angular cli workspace structure

02:29:06,800 --> 02:29:11,120
you see a part of our repo here on the

02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:13,359
right hand side

02:29:11,120 --> 02:29:16,080
and we wanted a single source code based

02:29:13,359 --> 02:29:18,240
solution so you can see we have

02:29:16,080 --> 02:29:19,840
the lumberjack app is a demo app it has

02:29:18,240 --> 02:29:22,319
an end to end test suite

02:29:19,840 --> 02:29:23,760
in the next folder it has a schematics

02:29:22,319 --> 02:29:26,319
target application

02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:28,399
i'll get back to that um because it also

02:29:26,319 --> 02:29:31,200
has an end-to-end test suite

02:29:28,399 --> 02:29:33,040
and in the bottom we see there's a bunch

02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:35,840
of tools that some node.js scripts

02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:37,520
integrating our different tool chain in

02:29:35,840 --> 02:29:40,479
our ci workflow

02:29:37,520 --> 02:29:41,200
and finally so we have the single source

02:29:40,479 --> 02:29:43,680
code base

02:29:41,200 --> 02:29:44,640
solution and we'll have a github actions

02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:48,720
job run

02:29:44,640 --> 02:29:48,720
per combination of dependencies

02:29:48,960 --> 02:29:52,479
so we have in total 50 jobs being run

02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:54,880
per ci

02:29:52,479 --> 02:29:56,399
run through 49 of them are github

02:29:54,880 --> 02:29:59,439
actions the last one is

02:29:56,399 --> 02:30:01,520
run in sonar cloud we have between 10

02:29:59,439 --> 02:30:03,760
and 30 jobs run in parallel

02:30:01,520 --> 02:30:05,760
we're an open source project so we get

02:30:03,760 --> 02:30:07,680
basically unlimited

02:30:05,760 --> 02:30:09,200
github action minutes from github so

02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:10,880
thank you very much for that

02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:12,399
or this would not even have been

02:30:10,880 --> 02:30:14,160
possible

02:30:12,399 --> 02:30:15,920
the whole workflow takes around six

02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:19,120
minutes in total despite

02:30:15,920 --> 02:30:21,200
49 jobs at this point um

02:30:19,120 --> 02:30:23,200
so yeah that's that's pretty neat setup

02:30:21,200 --> 02:30:25,359
and we spent

02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:26,590
a few months perfecting this setup so

02:30:25,359 --> 02:30:27,760
that's really nice

02:30:26,590 --> 02:30:30,880
[Music]

02:30:27,760 --> 02:30:33,040
the different jobs we see the build job

02:30:30,880 --> 02:30:35,439
is the first one it runs a production

02:30:33,040 --> 02:30:38,080
library build using the latest versions

02:30:35,439 --> 02:30:38,560
of all the tools and angle and so on and

02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:40,800
then it

02:30:38,560 --> 02:30:42,240
uploads a build artifact with that

02:30:40,800 --> 02:30:44,000
package which is

02:30:42,240 --> 02:30:46,000
exactly the package that will later be

02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:48,560
published to npm

02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:49,920
the lint job runs formatting checks and

02:30:48,560 --> 02:30:52,000
checks the lensing rules

02:30:49,920 --> 02:30:54,000
it also uses the latest versions of

02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:55,520
tools the tool chain and all the

02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:58,000
dependencies

02:30:55,520 --> 02:30:59,280
the sonar job generates test coverage

02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:01,200
and lint reports

02:30:59,280 --> 02:31:04,080
then it uploads them to sonar cloud for

02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:06,000
further processing

02:31:04,080 --> 02:31:07,280
and in the right hand side we see that

02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:09,359
the jobs that depend

02:31:07,280 --> 02:31:12,160
on the build job and we'll get back to

02:31:09,359 --> 02:31:12,160
that in a second

02:31:12,399 --> 02:31:15,439
the first job that doesn't depend on the

02:31:14,640 --> 02:31:18,560
build job

02:31:15,439 --> 02:31:21,680
is the lib or library job it uses

02:31:18,560 --> 02:31:24,160
the latest major node.js version

02:31:21,680 --> 02:31:25,760
supported by angular version 12.

02:31:24,160 --> 02:31:27,359
and it has these all these eight

02:31:25,760 --> 02:31:30,640
versions of angular

02:31:27,359 --> 02:31:32,479
which combined have fif five versions of

02:31:30,640 --> 02:31:35,520
typescript supported

02:31:32,479 --> 02:31:37,680
so we'll have um a ci run

02:31:35,520 --> 02:31:39,520
for this job per combination of

02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:40,720
dependencies as you can see in the right

02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:43,760
hand side

02:31:40,720 --> 02:31:47,040
it's actually eight

02:31:43,760 --> 02:31:48,479
runs in total they're called matrix lags

02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:49,520
the one you saw on the right hand side

02:31:48,479 --> 02:31:52,080
before

02:31:49,520 --> 02:31:53,359
so for each of those runs the setup

02:31:52,080 --> 02:31:55,680
process is that it

02:31:53,359 --> 02:31:56,720
first installs the angular version

02:31:55,680 --> 02:32:01,600
specified by

02:31:56,720 --> 02:32:04,080
the ci matrix then it installs the

02:32:01,600 --> 02:32:05,520
typescript version and other related

02:32:04,080 --> 02:32:07,439
dependencies

02:32:05,520 --> 02:32:09,359
with that setup out of the way now we

02:32:07,439 --> 02:32:10,560
can run the main content of this job

02:32:09,359 --> 02:32:13,439
which is

02:32:10,560 --> 02:32:14,319
run the unit and integration test for

02:32:13,439 --> 02:32:16,560
our development

02:32:14,319 --> 02:32:18,560
projects which are test utilities

02:32:16,560 --> 02:32:20,720
internally for the library

02:32:18,560 --> 02:32:21,920
then this the unit and integration test

02:32:20,720 --> 02:32:24,240
for the library itself

02:32:21,920 --> 02:32:25,680
and finally we even have unit and

02:32:24,240 --> 02:32:27,280
integration test for the angular

02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:30,399
schematics that are used for code

02:32:27,280 --> 02:32:32,399
generation and code mods

02:32:30,399 --> 02:32:34,240
the next job is the app job this one

02:32:32,399 --> 02:32:37,280
does depend on the build

02:32:34,240 --> 02:32:39,359
job it has a similar range but it adds

02:32:37,280 --> 02:32:40,800
another major version of node.js because

02:32:39,359 --> 02:32:43,280
some of these

02:32:40,800 --> 02:32:44,399
angular versions support node version 10

02:32:43,280 --> 02:32:47,760
as well

02:32:44,399 --> 02:32:51,120
so now we have more matrix legs we have

02:32:47,760 --> 02:32:51,600
16 in total so it adds another setup

02:32:51,120 --> 02:32:54,000
step

02:32:51,600 --> 02:32:55,920
install the version of node specified by

02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:58,080
the ci matrix

02:32:55,920 --> 02:33:00,160
it has some additional setup steps here

02:32:58,080 --> 02:33:00,720
because now we're getting to we want to

02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:04,560
test

02:33:00,720 --> 02:33:06,720
the library from a real application

02:33:04,560 --> 02:33:08,399
so typescript has this concept of path

02:33:06,720 --> 02:33:12,319
mappings

02:33:08,399 --> 02:33:15,520
which allows code to import

02:33:12,319 --> 02:33:18,000
code using a package name but the code

02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:19,840
might be in the same repo if you set up

02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:22,319
the path mappings and we have that in

02:33:19,840 --> 02:33:24,720
the repo but we want to delete that

02:33:22,319 --> 02:33:25,920
so that the next step step here makes

02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:27,840
sense

02:33:25,920 --> 02:33:29,600
so we're downloading that build artifact

02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:31,280
from the build job that's the package

02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:34,160
that will ship to npm

02:33:31,280 --> 02:33:35,760
removing it into node modules folder and

02:33:34,160 --> 02:33:38,720
the reason for that is

02:33:35,760 --> 02:33:39,840
this next step the angular compatibility

02:33:38,720 --> 02:33:41,920
compiler

02:33:39,840 --> 02:33:44,319
it's a bit of a temporary solution

02:33:41,920 --> 02:33:46,479
because angular is currently

02:33:44,319 --> 02:33:48,399
migrating from the previous generation

02:33:46,479 --> 02:33:50,399
compiler called view engine

02:33:48,399 --> 02:33:52,399
to the current generation angular

02:33:50,399 --> 02:33:54,399
compiler called ivy

02:33:52,399 --> 02:33:56,160
and right now we're in a situation where

02:33:54,399 --> 02:33:57,840
angular libraries are compiled with the

02:33:56,160 --> 02:34:00,319
previous generation

02:33:57,840 --> 02:34:01,439
so whenever an application installs an

02:34:00,319 --> 02:34:03,760
angular library

02:34:01,439 --> 02:34:04,800
it will have to run it through the ngcc

02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:09,680
compiler

02:34:04,800 --> 02:34:11,680
to up level it to iv instructions

02:34:09,680 --> 02:34:12,880
so we want to make sure we support that

02:34:11,680 --> 02:34:15,680
tool as well

02:34:12,880 --> 02:34:16,560
as long as it's necessary with all of

02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:18,560
this set up

02:34:16,560 --> 02:34:21,520
out of the way now we can run the demo

02:34:18,560 --> 02:34:23,840
applications unit and integration tests

02:34:21,520 --> 02:34:26,479
and we will also do do a production

02:34:23,840 --> 02:34:29,920
build of that application so we have

02:34:26,479 --> 02:34:31,200
an end to end on the unit and

02:34:29,920 --> 02:34:33,120
integration test level we have an

02:34:31,200 --> 02:34:35,280
end-to-end setup

02:34:33,120 --> 02:34:37,920
which is as close as you get to real

02:34:35,280 --> 02:34:37,920
application

02:34:38,160 --> 02:34:42,000
the next job is the end-to-end testing

02:34:40,080 --> 02:34:43,920
job we see

02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:45,760
the same setup as before only one

02:34:43,920 --> 02:34:48,479
version of node

02:34:45,760 --> 02:34:50,479
um but that is eight matrix lags in

02:34:48,479 --> 02:34:51,840
total and we have exactly the same setup

02:34:50,479 --> 02:34:54,000
as the previous

02:34:51,840 --> 02:34:55,359
job but now we're running end-to-end

02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:58,560
tests using the tool called

02:34:55,359 --> 02:35:00,000
protractor that will use a real browser

02:34:58,560 --> 02:35:01,120
in this case we install the latest

02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:03,200
version of google chrome

02:35:01,120 --> 02:35:04,960
then we run all the end-to-end tests for

02:35:03,200 --> 02:35:08,880
our demo application

02:35:04,960 --> 02:35:08,880
using the real package bundle

02:35:08,960 --> 02:35:12,640
the final job we have is the schematics

02:35:10,960 --> 02:35:15,359
and time testing job

02:35:12,640 --> 02:35:15,920
and we support almost every version here

02:35:15,359 --> 02:35:18,720
in this

02:35:15,920 --> 02:35:20,880
setup there is one detail missing about

02:35:18,720 --> 02:35:23,359
angular 9.0 because of the jest

02:35:20,880 --> 02:35:24,640
issue with typescript but we feel pretty

02:35:23,359 --> 02:35:27,120
conf

02:35:24,640 --> 02:35:28,720
confident that that we support even

02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:31,920
version 9.0 since we

02:35:28,720 --> 02:35:33,920
we are testing 9.1

02:35:31,920 --> 02:35:35,439
in this job we have the same setup as

02:35:33,920 --> 02:35:37,439
the two previous jobs

02:35:35,439 --> 02:35:38,720
but now we run the end-to-end test for

02:35:37,439 --> 02:35:40,319
the schematics

02:35:38,720 --> 02:35:43,200
and schematics are used through the

02:35:40,319 --> 02:35:45,040
command line so we will have a freshly

02:35:43,200 --> 02:35:48,560
generated angular project

02:35:45,040 --> 02:35:51,280
the target project for schematics and

02:35:48,560 --> 02:35:52,560
then we run from the command line it's

02:35:51,280 --> 02:35:54,800
called ng add

02:35:52,560 --> 02:35:56,240
it adds the package to the application

02:35:54,800 --> 02:35:59,200
and then it registers

02:35:56,240 --> 02:36:01,680
the library with um with angular and

02:35:59,200 --> 02:36:04,479
sets up basic configuration

02:36:01,680 --> 02:36:05,120
and in the future we'll we're working on

02:36:04,479 --> 02:36:08,399
some

02:36:05,120 --> 02:36:10,479
tools for generating code for using

02:36:08,399 --> 02:36:12,080
the library for example to add your own

02:36:10,479 --> 02:36:14,560
log driver

02:36:12,080 --> 02:36:16,240
so we're doing this for every major and

02:36:14,560 --> 02:36:18,319
minor version of angular and typescript

02:36:16,240 --> 02:36:21,280
supported

02:36:18,319 --> 02:36:23,120
a few more details about the ci matrix

02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:24,960
workflow

02:36:23,120 --> 02:36:27,280
you have probably seen this setup node

02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:30,399
action from github before

02:36:27,280 --> 02:36:31,680
and you might only have passed it a

02:36:30,399 --> 02:36:33,680
single version

02:36:31,680 --> 02:36:34,880
but here we have the ci matrix and

02:36:33,680 --> 02:36:36,560
github actions

02:36:34,880 --> 02:36:39,120
so we have two versions of node so

02:36:36,560 --> 02:36:40,960
there's there will be two jobs

02:36:39,120 --> 02:36:43,600
and each of them will specify version of

02:36:40,960 --> 02:36:46,560
node that we interpolate using

02:36:43,600 --> 02:36:48,319
matrix.node version so we wanted a

02:36:46,560 --> 02:36:51,840
similar setup for angular

02:36:48,319 --> 02:36:55,120
so now we have two times eight uh 16

02:36:51,840 --> 02:36:57,120
matrix lags in this job and we passed

02:36:55,120 --> 02:36:59,280
to angular version parameter we passed

02:36:57,120 --> 02:37:01,680
the matrix.angular version

02:36:59,280 --> 02:37:04,640
and interpolated so that comes from the

02:37:01,680 --> 02:37:06,479
ci matrix run

02:37:04,640 --> 02:37:07,760
but if you look closely at this action

02:37:06,479 --> 02:37:09,760
it's called ng worker

02:37:07,760 --> 02:37:12,479
slash angle versions action it's a

02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:14,640
package or a github action we created

02:37:12,479 --> 02:37:17,520
specifically for this library

02:37:14,640 --> 02:37:20,479
but as we'll see in a minute there's

02:37:17,520 --> 02:37:23,040
it's meant to be reused across

02:37:20,479 --> 02:37:24,960
any angular library for for ci setup so

02:37:23,040 --> 02:37:26,479
that's pretty nice

02:37:24,960 --> 02:37:27,410
so we have it published on the github

02:37:26,479 --> 02:37:28,960
actions marketplace

02:37:27,410 --> 02:37:31,040
[Music]

02:37:28,960 --> 02:37:32,640
what it does is it accepts this input

02:37:31,040 --> 02:37:34,319
parameter of the angular version

02:37:32,640 --> 02:37:36,960
and here's an example of a list

02:37:34,319 --> 02:37:39,120
parameter it then goes and replaces

02:37:36,960 --> 02:37:40,640
more than 20 angular typescript and

02:37:39,120 --> 02:37:43,680
related dependencies

02:37:40,640 --> 02:37:46,160
in package.json and each combination of

02:37:43,680 --> 02:37:48,399
dependencies has been verified by us to

02:37:46,160 --> 02:37:50,560
still be in a working state because

02:37:48,399 --> 02:37:52,640
we all know that over time dependencies

02:37:50,560 --> 02:37:55,760
and especially sub dependencies

02:37:52,640 --> 02:37:57,840
they degrade and sometimes break but we

02:37:55,760 --> 02:37:58,880
we have found a combination of

02:37:57,840 --> 02:38:01,040
dependencies that

02:37:58,880 --> 02:38:03,280
actually working and we're using that in

02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:05,439
this library

02:38:03,280 --> 02:38:07,520
so to sum up the workflow we have

02:38:05,439 --> 02:38:09,600
achieved is this

02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:11,520
we have this simple single source code

02:38:09,600 --> 02:38:13,520
based solution

02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:15,520
we have this purpose-built github action

02:38:13,520 --> 02:38:18,800
that can be reused and we have already

02:38:15,520 --> 02:38:20,479
gotten interest from two

02:38:18,800 --> 02:38:22,880
very popular angular libraries so we

02:38:20,479 --> 02:38:25,040
look forward to collaborating with them

02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:26,800
for them to use our github action we

02:38:25,040 --> 02:38:27,439
have a fast parallelized github actions

02:38:26,800 --> 02:38:29,600
workflow

02:38:27,439 --> 02:38:31,120
and each combination of dependencies is

02:38:29,600 --> 02:38:33,280
run in isolation

02:38:31,120 --> 02:38:35,200
both both for our unit and integration

02:38:33,280 --> 02:38:37,040
test our end to end test

02:38:35,200 --> 02:38:39,520
and even the end-to-end test for the

02:38:37,040 --> 02:38:40,880
angular schematics

02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:42,960
so working with cross-version

02:38:40,880 --> 02:38:45,359
compatibility is suddenly easy

02:38:42,960 --> 02:38:47,280
we can release features and patches

02:38:45,359 --> 02:38:49,359
across eight angular versions six

02:38:47,280 --> 02:38:50,240
typescript versions and two major nodejs

02:38:49,359 --> 02:38:53,520
versions

02:38:50,240 --> 02:38:55,520
from a single source code base and

02:38:53,520 --> 02:38:57,680
every time we manage to use backwards

02:38:55,520 --> 02:38:59,359
incompatible api and syntax it's

02:38:57,680 --> 02:39:02,640
immediately detected

02:38:59,359 --> 02:39:03,200
well not locally but as soon as you pass

02:39:02,640 --> 02:39:05,520
it to

02:39:03,200 --> 02:39:06,960
you push it to the ci within six minutes

02:39:05,520 --> 02:39:08,319
you'll know whether it's compatible with

02:39:06,960 --> 02:39:10,479
all the different versions

02:39:08,319 --> 02:39:12,160
and if it's not you'll know exactly

02:39:10,479 --> 02:39:14,240
which combination of dependencies

02:39:12,160 --> 02:39:15,200
has the issue and you're even

02:39:14,240 --> 02:39:17,200
technically

02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:19,280
able to reproduce that using the github

02:39:17,200 --> 02:39:21,439
action locally

02:39:19,280 --> 02:39:23,200
so we're adding verified support for a

02:39:21,439 --> 02:39:24,960
new version of angle and typescript and

02:39:23,200 --> 02:39:26,479
node.js is usually as simple

02:39:24,960 --> 02:39:29,439
as adding a value to a list of

02:39:26,479 --> 02:39:32,399
parameters in our ci workflow

02:39:29,439 --> 02:39:35,120
and let me tell you this is an amazing

02:39:32,399 --> 02:39:36,880
workflow as a library maintainer

02:39:35,120 --> 02:39:38,720
thank you very much for listening this

02:39:36,880 --> 02:39:41,680
is my twitter handle and the url

02:39:38,720 --> 02:39:44,000
for the library lumberjack see you all

02:39:41,680 --> 02:39:44,000
later

02:39:48,399 --> 02:39:51,439

uh because it showed you how much how

02:40:26,960 --> 02:40:30,560
many ci jobs they're running

02:40:29,040 --> 02:40:32,240
and you know how efficiently they're

02:40:30,560 --> 02:40:34,080
kind of like managing for

02:40:32,240 --> 02:40:35,439
lumber track that's that's really

02:40:34,080 --> 02:40:38,000
interesting so remember

head on over to getupsatellite.com

02:40:42,960 --> 02:40:46,399
discussions

02:40:44,080 --> 02:40:47,520
uh where you can ask him any questions

02:40:46,399 --> 02:40:49,520
and then you know

02:40:47,520 --> 02:40:51,520
have it answered also interact with the

02:40:49,520 --> 02:40:54,560
community out over there

02:40:51,520 --> 02:40:56,080
so also remember you are right here in

02:40:54,560 --> 02:40:58,399
the open source channel

02:40:56,080 --> 02:41:00,960
where we are all colorful and you know

02:40:58,399 --> 02:41:04,319
almost in the mood of celebrating holi

02:41:00,960 --> 02:41:05,279
um but there is also the devops channel

02:41:04,319 --> 02:41:07,840
which is happening

02:41:05,279 --> 02:41:09,600

friends divine mohit are hosting

02:41:09,600 --> 02:41:14,560
sessions on devops

02:41:11,200 --> 02:41:17,520
um on uh secure development developer

02:41:14,560 --> 02:41:20,640
experience and other things etc

02:41:17,520 --> 02:41:23,120

twitter as well and she's also like

02:41:56,720 --> 02:42:00,319
really well known as

02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:02,240
the hackathon queen uh and she's a

02:42:00,319 --> 02:42:03,040
developer community manager here at uh

02:42:02,240 --> 02:42:05,840
get her

02:42:03,040 --> 02:42:07,439

if you have any questions put them on

02:42:21,359 --> 02:42:25,920
we're gonna ask live as well

02:42:23,439 --> 02:42:28,800
with that alicia let's add one more

02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:32,479
person from the devil team out over here

mish manners hamesh

02:42:34,780 --> 02:42:37,950
[Music]

02:42:38,840 --> 02:42:41,840
hey

02:42:45,040 --> 02:42:51,279
so amazing to have that wonderful

02:42:48,640 --> 02:42:52,960
uh presentation that you gave me uh what

02:42:51,279 --> 02:42:54,880
a great introduction

02:42:52,960 --> 02:42:57,359
like oh i'm down here in a little screen

02:42:54,880 --> 02:42:59,359
um but uh if you do check out my setup

02:42:57,359 --> 02:43:01,279
if it doesn't happen to go full screen

02:42:59,359 --> 02:43:02,880
um chrono nisha did mention a bit of a

02:43:01,279 --> 02:43:03,520
streamer there's some cool things in the

02:43:02,880 --> 02:43:06,640
background

02:43:03,520 --> 02:43:09,040
i also loved anisha's little heart which

02:43:06,640 --> 02:43:11,439
was so cool so thank you anisha

02:43:09,040 --> 02:43:13,760
um for the heart um and thank you both

02:43:11,439 --> 02:43:15,920
for that fantastic introduction it was

02:43:13,760 --> 02:43:17,600
it was really cool it was so fun um

02:43:15,920 --> 02:43:19,680
hosting universe last year

02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:22,560
and i'm really excited to be back this

02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:25,439
time uh giving you a talk for satellite

02:43:22,560 --> 02:43:27,439
on how to github like boss uh so without

02:43:25,439 --> 02:43:30,000
further ado let's jump right in

i've done is i've broken up these top

02:44:20,720 --> 02:44:24,720
tips

02:44:21,439 --> 02:44:26,880
into four parts so the first one is

02:44:24,720 --> 02:44:28,319
personalization we'll talk about how

02:44:26,880 --> 02:44:31,120
you can make it hard work a little bit

02:44:28,319 --> 02:44:33,279
better for you next one is collaboration

02:44:31,120 --> 02:44:34,720
how to work really well with github for

02:44:33,279 --> 02:44:37,439
your team whether that's a

02:44:34,720 --> 02:44:37,920
developer focus or developer specific

02:44:37,439 --> 02:44:39,680
team

02:44:37,920 --> 02:44:41,359
or even how to work with non-developers

02:44:39,680 --> 02:44:43,200
as well we're going to talk about a

02:44:41,359 --> 02:44:44,560
little bit about the way you work and

02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:46,720
how to use github

02:44:44,560 --> 02:44:48,960
in the various different forms for your

02:44:46,720 --> 02:44:49,920
work and then obviously this is the open

02:44:48,960 --> 02:44:51,439
source channel

02:44:49,920 --> 02:44:53,439
so we are going to be talking about some

02:44:51,439 --> 02:44:55,520
top tips on using github

02:44:53,439 --> 02:44:57,040
for open source i mentioned we've only

02:44:55,520 --> 02:44:59,040
got 20 minutes

02:44:57,040 --> 02:45:00,560
so there's a lot more top tips than here

02:44:59,040 --> 02:45:01,439
so if there's a top tip that you really

02:45:00,560 --> 02:45:02,960
want to hear

02:45:01,439 --> 02:45:05,520
make sure you put it in the discussions

02:45:02,960 --> 02:45:07,760
and i'll try and answer at the end

02:45:05,520 --> 02:45:10,080
all right so personalization

02:45:07,760 --> 02:45:12,479
personalization is something that people

02:45:10,080 --> 02:45:14,000
love think about when you create a

02:45:12,479 --> 02:45:16,800
social media profile for the first

02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:18,000
time people love to personalize it you

02:45:16,800 --> 02:45:19,760
know they add a photo

02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:21,520
you might add where you're from you

02:45:19,760 --> 02:45:22,160
might add a few different things about

02:45:21,520 --> 02:45:24,160
yourself

02:45:22,160 --> 02:45:26,000
even when you're building lego lots of

02:45:24,160 --> 02:45:28,319
people like to personalize the way they

02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:30,560
do this i'm a big fan of lego um so i

02:45:28,319 --> 02:45:33,600
had to throw some lego into this talk

02:45:30,560 --> 02:45:35,600
somewhere but like you can customize

02:45:33,600 --> 02:45:36,960
a lego model or you can customize a

02:45:35,600 --> 02:45:39,439
social media profile

02:45:36,960 --> 02:45:41,200
you can customize github too now one of

02:45:39,439 --> 02:45:42,000
the first ways you can do this or just

02:45:41,200 --> 02:45:45,520
one way you can

02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:46,560
do this is our profile reviews now this

02:45:45,520 --> 02:45:49,120
is something that

02:45:46,560 --> 02:45:49,680
is relatively new we've launched it last

02:45:49,120 --> 02:45:51,680
year

02:45:49,680 --> 02:45:52,720
and it's a really fun way for you to

02:45:51,680 --> 02:45:55,600
customize and

02:45:52,720 --> 02:45:56,880
showcase who you are and what you do on

02:45:55,600 --> 02:46:00,399
github

02:45:56,880 --> 02:46:01,279
so you can add things like a little bio

02:46:00,399 --> 02:46:03,040
about yourself

02:46:01,279 --> 02:46:04,720
you can add some of the top projects

02:46:03,040 --> 02:46:07,040
that you're working on or like

02:46:04,720 --> 02:46:08,640
our good friend b dougie who also works

02:46:07,040 --> 02:46:10,319
on the developer relations team

02:46:08,640 --> 02:46:12,640
you can showcase other really cool

02:46:10,319 --> 02:46:13,840
developers so here's his top eight

02:46:12,640 --> 02:46:17,279
developers that he

02:46:13,840 --> 02:46:20,319
put on his bio now the

02:46:17,279 --> 02:46:21,359
profile review is really a sky's the

02:46:20,319 --> 02:46:23,040
limit kind of

02:46:21,359 --> 02:46:25,120
choose your own adventure you can do

02:46:23,040 --> 02:46:27,920
anything you want on your profile review

02:46:25,120 --> 02:46:29,200
and it's really really easy to set up so

02:46:27,920 --> 02:46:31,520
it's a way to set it up

02:46:29,200 --> 02:46:34,160
is if you head to your github profile

02:46:31,520 --> 02:46:36,720
open up a repository with the same

02:46:34,160 --> 02:46:38,560
name as your username when you do this

02:46:36,720 --> 02:46:40,640
you'll get like a little pop-up here

02:46:38,560 --> 02:46:43,120
saying this is a special repository

02:46:40,640 --> 02:46:44,080
you've now found a way to make a profile

02:46:43,120 --> 02:46:46,000
review

02:46:44,080 --> 02:46:48,319
so that's how you create it and then you

02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:50,240
can add anything you want into it

02:46:48,319 --> 02:46:52,240
so really make it yourself this is

02:46:50,240 --> 02:46:52,560
another really cool profile from one of

02:46:52,240 --> 02:46:54,800
our

02:46:52,560 --> 02:46:56,399
github stars and she's added this really

02:46:54,800 --> 02:46:58,640
cool banner up on top

02:46:56,399 --> 02:47:00,479
um and a little bit about her now you

02:46:58,640 --> 02:47:02,560
might have noticed from both the doggy's

02:47:00,479 --> 02:47:05,040
profile and monica's profile

02:47:02,560 --> 02:47:07,040
that there are like animations and gifs

02:47:05,040 --> 02:47:09,279
now because your profile ready is

02:47:07,040 --> 02:47:11,359
written completely in markdown

02:47:09,279 --> 02:47:13,279
you can add anything you want that would

02:47:11,359 --> 02:47:15,120
be considered in markdown so you can add

02:47:13,279 --> 02:47:17,520
gifs you can add images

02:47:15,120 --> 02:47:20,800
and you can add some video you can add

02:47:17,520 --> 02:47:23,279
emojis like here or you can even add

02:47:20,800 --> 02:47:24,720
games now this is the profile readme

02:47:23,279 --> 02:47:27,279
from one of our hobbies

02:47:24,720 --> 02:47:28,000
tim and he's had this community chess

02:47:27,279 --> 02:47:29,840
tournament

02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:32,000
happening on his profile for me for a

02:47:29,840 --> 02:47:34,720
while now so he's got this all running

02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:36,160
with github actions and you open up an

02:47:34,720 --> 02:47:36,880
issue which we'll talk about a bit more

02:47:36,160 --> 02:47:38,560
in a minute

02:47:36,880 --> 02:47:39,920
um but you open up and you can play this

02:47:38,560 --> 02:47:42,080
community chess tournament

02:47:39,920 --> 02:47:44,000
literally on his profile so if you go to

02:47:42,080 --> 02:47:45,120
his profile you'll be able to see this

02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:47,520
so i'll let you

02:47:45,120 --> 02:47:48,319
find that one so if you uh have a look

02:47:47,520 --> 02:47:51,439
for tim

02:47:48,319 --> 02:47:53,359
verwell on github you might find it

02:47:51,439 --> 02:47:54,960
now another way to customize github to

02:47:53,359 --> 02:47:57,040
work really well for you

02:47:54,960 --> 02:47:58,240
is to start looking at and checking out

02:47:57,040 --> 02:48:00,720
notifications

02:47:58,240 --> 02:48:03,200
now notifications if you've used any

02:48:00,720 --> 02:48:05,200
kind of platform before whether it's

02:48:03,200 --> 02:48:06,240
emails or obviously if you've been using

02:48:05,200 --> 02:48:08,240
github for a while

02:48:06,240 --> 02:48:10,560
you'll notice really quickly that you'll

02:48:08,240 --> 02:48:13,200
get a lot of notifications

02:48:10,560 --> 02:48:14,560
every time someone comments on an issue

02:48:13,200 --> 02:48:17,680
mentions you

02:48:14,560 --> 02:48:19,840
talks about you uh makes a pull request

02:48:17,680 --> 02:48:20,960
you'll get a notification so this can

02:48:19,840 --> 02:48:22,640
sometimes be

02:48:20,960 --> 02:48:24,000
really overwhelming and you can get a

02:48:22,640 --> 02:48:25,920
lot of notifications

02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:27,439
so one way to personalize github and

02:48:25,920 --> 02:48:29,520
make it work better for you

02:48:27,439 --> 02:48:30,880
is to start personalize some of these

02:48:29,520 --> 02:48:34,080
notifications

02:48:30,880 --> 02:48:35,920
so just recently we released a new way

02:48:34,080 --> 02:48:38,000
for you to filter notifications

02:48:35,920 --> 02:48:39,439
so you can now filter out notifications

02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:42,240
by organization

02:48:39,439 --> 02:48:44,240
or author so for example as krona and

02:48:42,240 --> 02:48:46,399
anisha mentioned i work for github right

02:48:44,240 --> 02:48:47,920
which means i'm part of the github org

02:48:46,399 --> 02:48:49,600
now because i do a few other things on

02:48:47,920 --> 02:48:50,640
github i also have a few other orgs that

02:48:49,600 --> 02:48:52,800
i'm part of

02:48:50,640 --> 02:48:54,399
now when i'm working during my work day

02:48:52,800 --> 02:48:55,920
i don't want notifications from all

02:48:54,399 --> 02:48:57,200
these other orgs i only want the

02:48:55,920 --> 02:48:58,880
notifications

02:48:57,200 --> 02:49:01,200
from github so i know what i'm working

02:48:58,880 --> 02:49:03,120
on so i can go through my notifications

02:49:01,200 --> 02:49:05,359
and filter out those notifications

02:49:03,120 --> 02:49:07,040
by github now you can get to

02:49:05,359 --> 02:49:09,760
notifications from almost

02:49:07,040 --> 02:49:10,880
anywhere on your computer or on your

02:49:09,760 --> 02:49:13,040
github profile

02:49:10,880 --> 02:49:14,800
on github all you do is click the bell

02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:16,960
up in the top right there

02:49:14,800 --> 02:49:17,920
um so if you can get that from your

02:49:16,960 --> 02:49:20,960
repair

02:49:17,920 --> 02:49:23,600
issues from your profile

02:49:20,960 --> 02:49:25,120
now one thing to note with notifications

02:49:23,600 --> 02:49:27,120
that some people get a little bit

02:49:25,120 --> 02:49:29,680
worried like oh my gosh i haven't

02:49:27,120 --> 02:49:31,520
checked out my notifications for a while

02:49:29,680 --> 02:49:32,960
if i go now and check them out there's

02:49:31,520 --> 02:49:34,479
going to be hundreds of thousands of

02:49:32,960 --> 02:49:35,600
notifications and i don't want to have

02:49:34,479 --> 02:49:36,880
to deal with that

02:49:35,600 --> 02:49:38,640
so if you haven't checked out your

02:49:36,880 --> 02:49:41,120
notifications in a while

02:49:38,640 --> 02:49:42,080
go to notifications and you'll get a

02:49:41,120 --> 02:49:44,240
pop-up

02:49:42,080 --> 02:49:45,600
and this will help you filter out all

02:49:44,240 --> 02:49:46,720
those notifications that you've got

02:49:45,600 --> 02:49:48,240
sitting in the backlog

02:49:46,720 --> 02:49:50,240
again this is something new that we

02:49:48,240 --> 02:49:51,760
launched because we thought that oh you

02:49:50,240 --> 02:49:53,120
know there's lots of people that are

02:49:51,760 --> 02:49:55,120
not going and checking out their

02:49:53,120 --> 02:49:56,560
notifications all the time what if we

02:49:55,120 --> 02:49:58,640
give people away that if they haven't

02:49:56,560 --> 02:50:00,479
visited their notifications for a while

02:49:58,640 --> 02:50:01,920
we'll help you clean those up so don't

02:50:00,479 --> 02:50:02,880
get scared about going and check out

02:50:01,920 --> 02:50:05,439
your notifications

02:50:02,880 --> 02:50:07,279
if you haven't seen them for a while now

02:50:05,439 --> 02:50:10,720
what else plays into notifications

02:50:07,279 --> 02:50:12,479
is reminders so if you are

02:50:10,720 --> 02:50:14,080
part of a lot of organizations and

02:50:12,479 --> 02:50:15,920
you're getting a lot of reminder or

02:50:14,080 --> 02:50:17,840
sorry notifications on github

02:50:15,920 --> 02:50:20,080
you might think oh i might actually miss

02:50:17,840 --> 02:50:22,560
a really important notification

02:50:20,080 --> 02:50:23,439
i might miss a task i might miss a

02:50:22,560 --> 02:50:25,439
milestone

02:50:23,439 --> 02:50:26,479
so how do i schedule a reminder or how

02:50:25,439 --> 02:50:29,200
do i schedule

02:50:26,479 --> 02:50:30,080
notification reminders you can do that

02:50:29,200 --> 02:50:32,319
in github

02:50:30,080 --> 02:50:33,520
you can actually connect your slack to

02:50:32,319 --> 02:50:35,120
your github and you can receive

02:50:33,520 --> 02:50:37,000
reminders in slack

02:50:35,120 --> 02:50:39,760
not only that but you can choose which

02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:41,520
organizations you receive reminders for

02:50:39,760 --> 02:50:44,399
now obviously i mentioned um i won't

02:50:41,520 --> 02:50:45,920
forget her so on my github slack channel

02:50:44,399 --> 02:50:48,319
i only want to receive

02:50:45,920 --> 02:50:50,000
reminder notifications on slack from

02:50:48,319 --> 02:50:50,800
github not from all the other orgs that

02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,720
i'm part of

02:50:50,800 --> 02:50:54,080
so you can easily do that and all you do

02:50:52,720 --> 02:50:56,640
is go to your settings

02:50:54,080 --> 02:50:59,200
and scroll down to your scheduled

02:50:56,640 --> 02:51:00,720
reminders and you'll be able to

02:50:59,200 --> 02:51:02,399
check out your reminders there and

02:51:00,720 --> 02:51:04,080
customize that a little bit

02:51:02,399 --> 02:51:05,600
so if you have a look here you can check

02:51:04,080 --> 02:51:07,760
it out you can customize it

02:51:05,600 --> 02:51:09,600
make it specific for each organization

02:51:07,760 --> 02:51:12,399
and really personalize it

02:51:09,600 --> 02:51:13,680
for your type of experience um so go and

02:51:12,399 --> 02:51:15,760
check that out

02:51:13,680 --> 02:51:16,800
now speaking of personalizing your

02:51:15,760 --> 02:51:17,439
experience you probably would have

02:51:16,800 --> 02:51:20,319
noticed

02:51:17,439 --> 02:51:22,640
my last few slides have all been quite

02:51:20,319 --> 02:51:24,319
bright and white and in your face and

02:51:22,640 --> 02:51:25,840
you're probably like well this nice dark

02:51:24,319 --> 02:51:26,880
background but the rest of it's really

02:51:25,840 --> 02:51:29,040
white and bright

02:51:26,880 --> 02:51:31,439
so something that we launched um that

02:51:29,040 --> 02:51:32,560
our users were really asking for and

02:51:31,439 --> 02:51:35,040
something that we launched

02:51:32,560 --> 02:51:36,399
at universe last year and if you've been

02:51:35,040 --> 02:51:37,200
on social media you probably would have

02:51:36,399 --> 02:51:40,000
seen it

02:51:37,200 --> 02:51:40,399
is our github dark mode now this has

02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,640
been

02:51:40,399 --> 02:51:43,760
really really exciting people have been

02:51:42,640 --> 02:51:46,640
absolutely

02:51:43,760 --> 02:51:47,760
loving this phone this mode is now

02:51:46,640 --> 02:51:49,920
available on

02:51:47,760 --> 02:51:51,840
github.com and it's completely native

02:51:49,920 --> 02:51:53,040
it's available across all our github

02:51:51,840 --> 02:51:55,680
suite of

02:51:53,040 --> 02:51:57,120
products so go and check out dark mode

02:51:55,680 --> 02:51:58,880
now it's really easy to check out dark

02:51:57,120 --> 02:52:00,960
mode if you're on your profile you'll

02:51:58,880 --> 02:52:02,000
see a little switch button or a little

02:52:00,960 --> 02:52:03,840
toggle at the top

02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:05,040
of your profile you'll be able to switch

02:52:03,840 --> 02:52:08,160
to dark mode

02:52:05,040 --> 02:52:09,680
we also have a new dim mode which just

02:52:08,160 --> 02:52:12,560
got released and announced

02:52:09,680 --> 02:52:14,080
last week so if you haven't checked out

02:52:12,560 --> 02:52:14,479
dim mode you might want to go check that

02:52:14,080 --> 02:52:17,359
out

02:52:14,479 --> 02:52:18,319
it's a slightly different contrast um

02:52:17,359 --> 02:52:21,120
like less

02:52:18,319 --> 02:52:22,319
less dark so um like different contrast

02:52:21,120 --> 02:52:24,399
you can see there so we've now got a

02:52:22,319 --> 02:52:26,000
light mode a dark mode and a dim mode

02:52:24,399 --> 02:52:28,399
uh but i really like the dark mode it

02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:29,600
really helps save your eyes um you see

02:52:28,399 --> 02:52:32,960
this nice beautiful

02:52:29,600 --> 02:52:35,200
darkness here so to save our eyes

02:52:32,960 --> 02:52:36,080
for the rest of my presentation we're

02:52:35,200 --> 02:52:39,920
going to be using

02:52:36,080 --> 02:52:41,520
github in dark mode so let's jump in

02:52:39,920 --> 02:52:43,439
so one of the things people love about

02:52:41,520 --> 02:52:45,680
using github is the type of

02:52:43,439 --> 02:52:47,279
collaboration you can do on github

02:52:45,680 --> 02:52:49,040
now if you've been using github as a

02:52:47,279 --> 02:52:51,279
developer you'll probably know about a

02:52:49,040 --> 02:52:54,000
lot of our collaboration tools

02:52:51,279 --> 02:52:55,200
like uh code review and merging and

02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:57,200
things like that

02:52:55,200 --> 02:52:59,200
now since a lot of people know about

02:52:57,200 --> 02:53:01,439
those i thought we'd talk about a few of

02:52:59,200 --> 02:53:03,120
the tools that we have as github

02:53:01,439 --> 02:53:04,479
to collaborate which you might not

02:53:03,120 --> 02:53:05,840
necessarily know about

02:53:04,479 --> 02:53:07,520
these also really good ways to

02:53:05,840 --> 02:53:09,040
collaborate across your entire

02:53:07,520 --> 02:53:10,240
organization

02:53:09,040 --> 02:53:13,120
and the first sign which is one of my

02:53:10,240 --> 02:53:15,040
personal favorites is project boards

02:53:13,120 --> 02:53:16,880
project boards are really great for

02:53:15,040 --> 02:53:19,520
tracking the overall progress

02:53:16,880 --> 02:53:21,520
of a particular project you can also use

02:53:19,520 --> 02:53:24,080
it for a variety of different

02:53:21,520 --> 02:53:24,720
reasons so so this one here is our

02:53:24,080 --> 02:53:27,439
github

02:53:24,720 --> 02:53:28,160
roadmap this is our public roadmap again

02:53:27,439 --> 02:53:30,240
something

02:53:28,160 --> 02:53:32,640
we launched last year out to the

02:53:30,240 --> 02:53:33,520
community and you can easily see at a

02:53:32,640 --> 02:53:36,000
glance

02:53:33,520 --> 02:53:38,080
what we're releasing and when so across

02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,880
the top of our project boards we've got

02:53:38,080 --> 02:53:40,960
each quarter

02:53:38,880 --> 02:53:42,720
that's coming up and the different

02:53:40,960 --> 02:53:44,240
features and products that we're

02:53:42,720 --> 02:53:46,240
releasing across that coil

02:53:44,240 --> 02:53:47,359
each one is an issue so you can click on

02:53:46,240 --> 02:53:50,240
that and go and see

02:53:47,359 --> 02:53:50,880
more happening on the project board now

02:53:50,240 --> 02:53:52,640
this is a

02:53:50,880 --> 02:53:54,960
really good way to collaborate with

02:53:52,640 --> 02:53:56,560
non-developers because non-developers

02:53:54,960 --> 02:53:57,760
are often familiar with this project

02:53:56,560 --> 02:53:59,359
board type setup

02:53:57,760 --> 02:54:01,120
there's lots of different ways to use

02:53:59,359 --> 02:54:02,800
project boards too like we've obviously

02:54:01,120 --> 02:54:04,240
used it here as a roadmap

02:54:02,800 --> 02:54:06,399
but i've spoken to open source

02:54:04,240 --> 02:54:08,720
maintainers who use it to track

02:54:06,399 --> 02:54:11,439
different events that they've got coming

02:54:08,720 --> 02:54:14,560
up i even use project boards myself

02:54:11,439 --> 02:54:16,560
personally i have my own personal mesh

02:54:14,560 --> 02:54:17,200
list project board and it's got things

02:54:16,560 --> 02:54:19,920
like

02:54:17,200 --> 02:54:20,560
my shopping list and holidays that i

02:54:19,920 --> 02:54:22,880
want to go

02:54:20,560 --> 02:54:24,640
on and other tasks that i might want to

02:54:22,880 --> 02:54:24,960
track or projects i might be interested

02:54:24,640 --> 02:54:27,279
in

02:54:24,960 --> 02:54:28,800
so product boards are really up to you

02:54:27,279 --> 02:54:30,960
and you can customize it

02:54:28,800 --> 02:54:33,359
and really personalize it for you and

02:54:30,960 --> 02:54:34,640
the way that you want to use it

02:54:33,359 --> 02:54:36,880
now another really good way to

02:54:34,640 --> 02:54:37,840
collaborate with people is our

02:54:36,880 --> 02:54:39,840
discussions

02:54:37,840 --> 02:54:42,240
you're obviously going to be getting a

02:54:39,840 --> 02:54:44,080
first taste of discussions or firsthand

02:54:42,240 --> 02:54:45,439
taste of discussions if you're heading

02:54:44,080 --> 02:54:47,680
over to discussions

02:54:45,439 --> 02:54:49,040
during this talk or afterwards but it's

02:54:47,680 --> 02:54:52,399
a really great way

02:54:49,040 --> 02:54:55,200
to communicate chat collaborate and

02:54:52,399 --> 02:54:57,200
have a discussion on github so if you've

02:54:55,200 --> 02:54:59,120
been using github as a developer for a

02:54:57,200 --> 02:55:00,960
while you probably know that those

02:54:59,120 --> 02:55:02,240
there's those issues that you have that

02:55:00,960 --> 02:55:04,800
aren't really issues

02:55:02,240 --> 02:55:07,120
they're more like discussions so now we

02:55:04,800 --> 02:55:08,960
want to separate discussions from issues

02:55:07,120 --> 02:55:11,120
we really wanted issues

02:55:08,960 --> 02:55:12,080
to be a way for you to talk about new

02:55:11,120 --> 02:55:14,560
features

02:55:12,080 --> 02:55:16,479
new products and bug fixes and things

02:55:14,560 --> 02:55:17,439
like that and then have discussions as a

02:55:16,479 --> 02:55:19,040
way for you to chat

02:55:17,439 --> 02:55:20,960
and collaborate now you can use

02:55:19,040 --> 02:55:21,359
discussions for a variety of different

02:55:20,960 --> 02:55:23,600
things

02:55:21,359 --> 02:55:26,080
you can see across the um the side

02:55:23,600 --> 02:55:28,399
column there you can use them for ideas

02:55:26,080 --> 02:55:30,560
q and a's again i've chatted to some

02:55:28,399 --> 02:55:32,800
project maintainers asking what they

02:55:30,560 --> 02:55:34,560
what they use discussions for some of

02:55:32,800 --> 02:55:36,399
them said they even use discussions

02:55:34,560 --> 02:55:38,800
for people within the org to share their

02:55:36,399 --> 02:55:39,520
favorite holiday or surfing destination

02:55:38,800 --> 02:55:42,640
i was like

02:55:39,520 --> 02:55:44,640
that's really cool um but often

02:55:42,640 --> 02:55:46,080
you can have these types of discussions

02:55:44,640 --> 02:55:46,880
and really separate them from your

02:55:46,080 --> 02:55:49,040
issues

02:55:46,880 --> 02:55:50,640
now if you ever notice that an issue

02:55:49,040 --> 02:55:51,120
that you've opened or someone else is

02:55:50,640 --> 02:55:53,279
open

02:55:51,120 --> 02:55:54,960
is becoming more of a discussion or a

02:55:53,279 --> 02:55:55,600
chat or collaboration instead of an

02:55:54,960 --> 02:55:58,000
issue

02:55:55,600 --> 02:55:59,600
you can easily go and convert that issue

02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:01,920
into a discussion

02:55:59,600 --> 02:56:03,040
so here i opened up an issue to talk

02:56:01,920 --> 02:56:04,560
about a logo

02:56:03,040 --> 02:56:07,040
i was like i think we should get a new

02:56:04,560 --> 02:56:08,240
logo um let's see what we're going to do

02:56:07,040 --> 02:56:10,080
who we're going to get

02:56:08,240 --> 02:56:12,000
and it became too much of a discussion

02:56:10,080 --> 02:56:14,560
so i quickly went in and said

02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:16,399
yeah let's convert this to a discussion

02:56:14,560 --> 02:56:17,200
um and now as you can see with our

02:56:16,399 --> 02:56:19,200
discussion

02:56:17,200 --> 02:56:21,120
we can have thread of replies we can

02:56:19,200 --> 02:56:22,880
have forum style conversations

02:56:21,120 --> 02:56:24,560
and we can keep all the chat and

02:56:22,880 --> 02:56:27,120
discussion happening over here and

02:56:24,560 --> 02:56:30,080
separate it out from our issues

02:56:27,120 --> 02:56:32,080
now speaking of separating things and

02:56:30,080 --> 02:56:34,880
the way that people work now

02:56:32,080 --> 02:56:35,520
uh we really wanted developers and we

02:56:34,880 --> 02:56:38,160
ourselves

02:56:35,520 --> 02:56:38,960
as um people who use github and as

02:56:38,160 --> 02:56:41,200
developers

02:56:38,960 --> 02:56:43,359
we like to work the way that we want to

02:56:41,200 --> 02:56:44,240
and at github we want to give you that

02:56:43,359 --> 02:56:46,399
same power

02:56:44,240 --> 02:56:47,840
we want you to use github the way that

02:56:46,399 --> 02:56:50,479
you want to use it

02:56:47,840 --> 02:56:50,880
um and so because of that we decided

02:56:50,479 --> 02:56:52,960
that

02:56:50,880 --> 02:56:54,640
we'd provide github in a number of

02:56:52,960 --> 02:56:55,439
different formats a number of different

02:56:54,640 --> 02:56:57,359
platforms

02:56:55,439 --> 02:57:00,319
another a number of different ways that

02:56:57,359 --> 02:57:03,520
you can use and engage with github

02:57:00,319 --> 02:57:05,200
so one of those is github for mobile

02:57:03,520 --> 02:57:07,120
this allows you to take github with

02:57:05,200 --> 02:57:08,720
unique everywhere you go

02:57:07,120 --> 02:57:10,000
now obviously not many people are

02:57:08,720 --> 02:57:10,960
traveling at the moment but when you do

02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:12,560
travel again

02:57:10,960 --> 02:57:14,000
uh you'll be able to get help with you

02:57:12,560 --> 02:57:16,080
everywhere in your pocket

02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:18,000
it's available on ios and android and

02:57:16,080 --> 02:57:20,000
you can do so much on

02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:22,000
mobile you can quickly comment on an

02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:25,040
issue review bug fixes

02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:28,080
merge code and now as of

02:57:25,040 --> 02:57:30,000
uh probably about a month ago or so now

02:57:28,080 --> 02:57:31,359
um you can even have discussions on

02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:33,359
mobile as well

02:57:31,359 --> 02:57:35,600
uh so the latest version was released

02:57:33,359 --> 02:57:37,279
last week for mobile and even includes

02:57:35,600 --> 02:57:39,760
release notes for github now

02:57:37,279 --> 02:57:41,439
so make sure you go check those out one

02:57:39,760 --> 02:57:43,120
of the things i love about mobile is

02:57:41,439 --> 02:57:43,920
being able to quickly do something on

02:57:43,120 --> 02:57:46,800
the fly

02:57:43,920 --> 02:57:47,840
for example um if an issue gets opened

02:57:46,800 --> 02:57:50,399
by my team

02:57:47,840 --> 02:57:51,040
and it's you know 7 p.m my time on a

02:57:50,399 --> 02:57:52,479
friday

02:57:51,040 --> 02:57:54,080
i don't want to completely block them

02:57:52,479 --> 02:57:55,520
over the weekend i can just quickly

02:57:54,080 --> 02:57:57,439
comment on an issue

02:57:55,520 --> 02:57:58,720
and quickly unblock it without having to

02:57:57,439 --> 02:58:01,359
go to my computer

02:57:58,720 --> 02:58:04,000
fire up github and go from there so

02:58:01,359 --> 02:58:05,760
that's why i love mobile it's really fun

02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:07,520
another one of my personal favorites

02:58:05,760 --> 02:58:10,240
which some people have been loving too

02:58:07,520 --> 02:58:12,240
is github desktop now i really like you

02:58:10,240 --> 02:58:14,479
have desktop it's available on

02:58:12,240 --> 02:58:15,279
windows and mac os and it's a really

02:58:14,479 --> 02:58:17,680
good way to

02:58:15,279 --> 02:58:18,960
organize your repos so all you do is

02:58:17,680 --> 02:58:20,640
drag and drop a repo

02:58:18,960 --> 02:58:22,399
into github desktop and then you can

02:58:20,640 --> 02:58:24,960
manage that repo from there

02:58:22,399 --> 02:58:26,800
what github desktop does is it compares

02:58:24,960 --> 02:58:28,880
the repo that you've got on your local

02:58:26,800 --> 02:58:32,080
machine to the version in the cloud

02:58:28,880 --> 02:58:34,160
um and me being not so familiar or

02:58:32,080 --> 02:58:37,439
remembering different commands to fix

02:58:34,160 --> 02:58:39,200
github or you know have i merged my

02:58:37,439 --> 02:58:41,279
thing yet you know is it

02:58:39,200 --> 02:58:42,640
am i one step behind master on my

02:58:41,279 --> 02:58:45,680
computer or main

02:58:42,640 --> 02:58:48,880
sorry am i behind main on my computer

02:58:45,680 --> 02:58:51,760
is my origin in front of my local copy

02:58:48,880 --> 02:58:53,520
github desktop manages all that for me

02:58:51,760 --> 02:58:54,319
so i love these big blue buttons that

02:58:53,520 --> 02:58:57,279
come up like

02:58:54,319 --> 02:58:58,960
oh you are one commit behind maine would

02:58:57,279 --> 02:59:00,240
you like to pull in the origin and make

02:58:58,960 --> 02:59:02,240
your local machine

02:59:00,240 --> 02:59:03,600
uh pair up with what's on the cloud so

02:59:02,240 --> 02:59:05,200
that's why i really love

02:59:03,600 --> 02:59:06,960
desktop you know it's all these nice big

02:59:05,200 --> 02:59:07,520
blue buttons and toggle and push

02:59:06,960 --> 02:59:09,120
commands

02:59:07,520 --> 02:59:10,800
i don't have to really think about what

02:59:09,120 --> 02:59:12,319
i need to do next um

02:59:10,800 --> 02:59:14,720
so i'll have github desktop as you can

02:59:12,319 --> 02:59:15,520
see here it's available in dark mode as

02:59:14,720 --> 02:59:17,600
well

02:59:15,520 --> 02:59:19,439
our theme github desktop is you can go

02:59:17,600 --> 02:59:21,200
through the history of all your files

02:59:19,439 --> 02:59:23,680
and compare and view the changes so you

02:59:21,200 --> 02:59:25,600
can see in red it's being deleted and in

02:59:23,680 --> 02:59:27,680
green they're the added versions

02:59:25,600 --> 02:59:28,800
so the latest version of github desktop

02:59:27,680 --> 02:59:30,560
shipped on march

02:59:28,800 --> 02:59:32,880
10th so make sure you're up to date with

02:59:30,560 --> 02:59:36,080
github desktop to

02:59:32,880 --> 02:59:36,399
enjoy all the fancy features we have now

02:59:36,080 --> 02:59:39,520
if

02:59:36,399 --> 02:59:40,319
mobile and desktop aren't your cup of

02:59:39,520 --> 02:59:43,439
teas

02:59:40,319 --> 02:59:45,439
maybe you'll like our cli so last year

02:59:43,439 --> 02:59:48,160
we launched the github cli

02:59:45,439 --> 02:59:49,439
and developers have been loving our cli

02:59:48,160 --> 02:59:52,640
being able to use

02:59:49,439 --> 02:59:55,279
and seamlessly work in one window so

02:59:52,640 --> 02:59:56,319
github cli allows you to do so many

02:59:55,279 --> 02:59:59,040
different things

02:59:56,319 --> 03:00:00,640
you can create view and edit issues

02:59:59,040 --> 03:00:03,200
directly from the cli

03:00:00,640 --> 03:00:05,359
you can check out prs you can now auto

03:00:03,200 --> 03:00:07,200
merge pr's which is a new feature for

03:00:05,359 --> 03:00:07,840
our cli that was released a few weeks

03:00:07,200 --> 03:00:10,000
ago

03:00:07,840 --> 03:00:11,920
you can easily clone a repo you can

03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:14,800
manage ssh keys and

03:00:11,920 --> 03:00:16,720
so much more cli has been really fun

03:00:14,800 --> 03:00:19,600
even i've been loving using it

03:00:16,720 --> 03:00:20,479
it's available on windows mac os and

03:00:19,600 --> 03:00:22,880
linux

03:00:20,479 --> 03:00:24,399
also fun fact about github cli is it's

03:00:22,880 --> 03:00:26,880
open source and

03:00:24,399 --> 03:00:28,319
you can contribute to it as well so

03:00:26,880 --> 03:00:29,760
speaking of open source

03:00:28,319 --> 03:00:31,279
as i mentioned we're on the open source

03:00:29,760 --> 03:00:32,800
channel so i'm going to give you a few

03:00:31,279 --> 03:00:34,240
top tips on

03:00:32,800 --> 03:00:35,920
getting involved in open source and

03:00:34,240 --> 03:00:37,920
working in open source

03:00:35,920 --> 03:00:40,080
so first one is getting involved in open

03:00:37,920 --> 03:00:41,439
source now if you're sitting there

03:00:40,080 --> 03:00:43,840
some people think well you know how do i

03:00:41,439 --> 03:00:46,319
get involved how do i find projects

03:00:43,840 --> 03:00:48,720
you know one tip that um is one of my

03:00:46,319 --> 03:00:51,760
top tips that was also shared yesterday

03:00:48,720 --> 03:00:53,359
during one of our satellite panels is um

03:00:51,760 --> 03:00:54,319
contributing to projects that you might

03:00:53,359 --> 03:00:57,600
already use

03:00:54,319 --> 03:01:00,800
for example i am currently using obs

03:00:57,600 --> 03:01:01,600
to run this presentation obs is an open

03:01:00,800 --> 03:01:03,439
source project

03:01:01,600 --> 03:01:05,200
so if you use obs that's a really good

03:01:03,439 --> 03:01:06,640
way you can go in and

03:01:05,200 --> 03:01:08,640
jump in and keep um and start

03:01:06,640 --> 03:01:10,000
contributing to obs

03:01:08,640 --> 03:01:11,680
you can also find really good projects

03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:12,880
to contribute to through events like

03:01:11,680 --> 03:01:14,399
hacktoberfest

03:01:12,880 --> 03:01:16,160
what about all the other times of the

03:01:14,399 --> 03:01:17,760
year or if you're stuck

03:01:16,160 --> 03:01:20,000
for what you're currently using or if

03:01:17,760 --> 03:01:22,160
you just want something completely new

03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:23,040
you can go and check out trending topics

03:01:22,160 --> 03:01:24,960
on github

03:01:23,040 --> 03:01:26,880
this is a really fun way to find out

03:01:24,960 --> 03:01:29,600
what's currently trending on github

03:01:26,880 --> 03:01:32,000
it's also a great way to search by type

03:01:29,600 --> 03:01:32,800
by language type both written and spoken

03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:34,800
language

03:01:32,800 --> 03:01:36,720
so if you go i'm a python developer i

03:01:34,800 --> 03:01:37,840
want to go and search our top projects

03:01:36,720 --> 03:01:39,600
of training on github

03:01:37,840 --> 03:01:41,920
and python and start contributing to

03:01:39,600 --> 03:01:43,439
that now once you've found a project you

03:01:41,920 --> 03:01:46,080
think you might be interested in

03:01:43,439 --> 03:01:47,760
have a look at their reading profile if

03:01:46,080 --> 03:01:48,800
a project is really good or have a good

03:01:47,760 --> 03:01:52,160
review

03:01:48,800 --> 03:01:54,720
now as the name suggests read this

03:01:52,160 --> 03:01:56,319
does it make sense does it excite you

03:01:54,720 --> 03:01:57,920
does it entice you

03:01:56,319 --> 03:01:59,920
it'll have a really good explanation of

03:01:57,920 --> 03:02:02,560
what the project does and how it works

03:01:59,920 --> 03:02:04,240
and if this resonates with you and you

03:02:02,560 --> 03:02:05,680
might think you might want to contribute

03:02:04,240 --> 03:02:07,760
next thing to do is look at the

03:02:05,680 --> 03:02:09,120
contribution guidelines again if it's a

03:02:07,760 --> 03:02:10,560
good project we'll have really good

03:02:09,120 --> 03:02:12,319
contribution guidelines

03:02:10,560 --> 03:02:14,560
that tell you how to contribute to the

03:02:12,319 --> 03:02:15,840
project and how to get involved in

03:02:14,560 --> 03:02:17,840
starting to contribute

03:02:15,840 --> 03:02:19,279
again does it resonate with you does it

03:02:17,840 --> 03:02:20,319
sound like a community you want to be a

03:02:19,279 --> 03:02:22,800
part of

03:02:20,319 --> 03:02:24,640
if so then go and check out their issues

03:02:22,800 --> 03:02:25,279
and have a look at these labels called

03:02:24,640 --> 03:02:27,760
good first

03:02:25,279 --> 03:02:29,840
issues these have been identified by

03:02:27,760 --> 03:02:32,560
maintainers as good ways to get

03:02:29,840 --> 03:02:34,080
involved in github and well sorry within

03:02:32,560 --> 03:02:35,840
the project itself

03:02:34,080 --> 03:02:37,840
and it's identified as an issue that's

03:02:35,840 --> 03:02:39,200
been that's relatively easy to solve

03:02:37,840 --> 03:02:40,720
and will give you a good understanding

03:02:39,200 --> 03:02:43,040
of the project that you're starting to

03:02:40,720 --> 03:02:45,279
contribute to

03:02:43,040 --> 03:02:46,800
so that's pretty much brings us to time

03:02:45,279 --> 03:02:48,240

if you've ever seen me do any live

03:04:58,560 --> 03:05:02,800
coding on twitch

03:04:59,520 --> 03:05:05,600
i use the cli desktop and

03:05:02,800 --> 03:05:06,160
um you know even code spaces and things

03:05:05,600 --> 03:05:07,680
i use

03:05:06,160 --> 03:05:10,000
all the things i talked about i actually

03:05:14,560 --> 03:05:19,520
had a chance to have a look at so i use

03:05:17,359 --> 03:05:21,279
all the whole github sleep pretty much

03:05:19,520 --> 03:05:24,479
every single day and it's so fun

03:05:21,279 --> 03:05:26,479
i love desktop i love using the cli

03:05:24,479 --> 03:05:27,520
it's new and it's exciting and they're

03:05:26,479 --> 03:05:29,680
always adding

03:05:27,520 --> 03:05:30,800
in new commands so using the cli is

03:05:29,680 --> 03:05:32,560
really fun

03:05:30,800 --> 03:05:34,000
and project board's a really fun way to

03:05:32,560 --> 03:05:35,439
collaborate with everyone across the

03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:36,080
team you know both of you know that we

03:05:35,439 --> 03:05:38,479
use it

03:05:36,080 --> 03:05:39,359
um as part of our devrel team as well so

03:05:38,479 --> 03:05:40,800
yeah i get to use

03:05:39,359 --> 03:05:43,279
all the cool things on github every

03:05:40,800 --> 03:05:43,279
single day

03:05:43,520 --> 03:05:46,640
so mish we know that you definitely

03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:49,200
github

03:05:46,640 --> 03:05:52,080
like a boss but what's the one biggest

03:05:49,200 --> 03:05:54,880
top tip on getting started with github

03:05:52,080 --> 03:05:55,600
um okay getting started especially if

03:05:54,880 --> 03:05:58,640
you're

03:05:55,600 --> 03:06:00,080
like new to github or you've been maybe

03:05:58,640 --> 03:06:02,160
even using github for a while

03:06:00,080 --> 03:06:04,479
you're looking for the next big thing is

03:06:02,160 --> 03:06:06,880
whenever i'm using github or even just

03:06:04,479 --> 03:06:08,560
generally using the internet i nearly

03:06:06,880 --> 03:06:10,960
always come across

03:06:08,560 --> 03:06:12,160
um github repos and my biggest tip is

03:06:10,960 --> 03:06:15,200
just go and style them

03:06:12,160 --> 03:06:17,279
i just start everything on github um for

03:06:15,200 --> 03:06:19,040
example i recently got into um

03:06:17,279 --> 03:06:22,240
cryptocurrency mining

03:06:19,040 --> 03:06:24,080
um and i found or like the the tool that

03:06:22,240 --> 03:06:26,720
i used to mine crypto

03:06:24,080 --> 03:06:28,640
again website there scroll down oh cool

03:06:26,720 --> 03:06:29,920
i got some social media channels oh wow

03:06:28,640 --> 03:06:32,399
their repo is all

03:06:29,920 --> 03:06:33,439
posted on github so i immediately went

03:06:32,399 --> 03:06:35,040
to the repo

03:06:33,439 --> 03:06:36,479
starred the repo and i was like well i'm

03:06:35,040 --> 03:06:38,960
just going to have a look around at the

03:06:36,479 --> 03:06:41,600
ready flowers and check out the project

03:06:38,960 --> 03:06:43,439
um i found a bug with the um like with

03:06:41,600 --> 03:06:45,359
the software so i opened up an issue

03:06:43,439 --> 03:06:46,720
i even found the fix for it so i like

03:06:45,359 --> 03:06:48,640
put it in the issue

03:06:46,720 --> 03:06:50,640
but i think that's my top tip is like

03:06:48,640 --> 03:06:52,319
when you're browsing and you're surfing

03:06:50,640 --> 03:06:54,399
the internet you find

03:06:52,319 --> 03:06:56,479
really good little pieces of like

03:06:54,399 --> 03:06:57,760
programs or things that you might use

03:06:56,479 --> 03:06:59,520
have a look at where it's actually

03:06:57,760 --> 03:07:01,680
hosted most of the time they're hosted

03:06:59,520 --> 03:07:03,600
on github and i just go and star them

03:07:01,680 --> 03:07:05,680
um so i can go and find them um for

03:07:03,600 --> 03:07:07,600
future but also like it's just really

03:07:05,680 --> 03:07:10,080
cool to see that all the things that

03:07:07,600 --> 03:07:13,279
i get to use every day just just hosted

03:07:10,080 --> 03:07:13,279
on github which is awesome

03:07:13,439 --> 03:07:17,359
wow that's that's absolutely you know

03:07:15,680 --> 03:07:18,319
let's just just go and start them and

03:07:17,359 --> 03:07:21,359
then have them

03:07:18,319 --> 03:07:23,200
have them ready out over there so um

03:07:21,359 --> 03:07:25,600
mish you know i know i know you kind of

03:07:23,200 --> 03:07:27,279
uh interact with a lot of the developers

03:07:25,600 --> 03:07:29,920
and keep talking to them

03:07:27,279 --> 03:07:31,200
uh was there was there one tip that you

03:07:29,920 --> 03:07:33,600
know you felt that

03:07:31,200 --> 03:07:35,359
oh my god you know even the power users

03:07:33,600 --> 03:07:38,080
are not aware of this is

03:07:35,359 --> 03:07:40,399
is there something like that there there

03:07:38,080 --> 03:07:43,200
is one and it came out recently um

03:07:40,399 --> 03:07:45,040
in a top tip video that i did um but i

03:07:43,200 --> 03:07:46,800
decided to do the top tip video because

03:07:45,040 --> 03:07:48,720
i showed it live on stream so if you do

03:07:46,800 --> 03:07:50,399
ever come into my streams you get some

03:07:48,720 --> 03:07:52,319
really cool insights on what the top tip

03:07:50,399 --> 03:07:53,439
videos are going to be but i showed this

03:07:52,319 --> 03:07:56,000
thing on stream

03:07:53,439 --> 03:07:57,760
and it was really um good timing so most

03:07:56,000 --> 03:07:59,520
of you know if you've been um

03:07:57,760 --> 03:08:01,359
surfing around social media you would

03:07:59,520 --> 03:08:02,160
have seen the github skyline stuff that

03:08:01,359 --> 03:08:04,080
we announced

03:08:02,160 --> 03:08:05,760
which is a way for you to go in and get

03:08:04,080 --> 03:08:09,120
a 3d version or

03:08:05,760 --> 03:08:10,800
3d image of your contribution graph

03:08:09,120 --> 03:08:12,640
and i was like this is really cool i can

03:08:10,800 --> 03:08:14,160
like download a 3d image and stuff and

03:08:12,640 --> 03:08:17,200
then someone mentioned to me like

03:08:14,160 --> 03:08:18,720
you know that you can view and host 3d

03:08:17,200 --> 03:08:21,040
files on github so

03:08:18,720 --> 03:08:22,080
i even like printed out lines this is my

03:08:21,040 --> 03:08:25,120
03:08:22,080 --> 03:08:26,640
um one here and i was like this on

03:08:25,120 --> 03:08:28,080
stream i was like we did this and i was

03:08:26,640 --> 03:08:30,560
like oh but if you want to see it

03:08:28,080 --> 03:08:31,120
and put it on github you can store the

03:08:30,560 --> 03:08:33,840
3d

03:08:31,120 --> 03:08:36,080
file for this on a github and so i put

03:08:33,840 --> 03:08:38,479
the file on and you can spin it and

03:08:36,080 --> 03:08:40,080
turn it and use it and play with it on

03:08:38,479 --> 03:08:41,520
github i was like that's really cool

03:08:40,080 --> 03:08:43,840
my whole audience was just sitting there

03:08:41,520 --> 03:08:45,920
like this is really awesome

03:08:43,840 --> 03:08:48,960
and i was like it gets better guys check

03:08:45,920 --> 03:08:51,120
this out so i put my 2019

03:08:48,960 --> 03:08:52,479
that was my 2020 graph i put it against

03:08:51,120 --> 03:08:55,040
my 2019 graph

03:08:52,479 --> 03:08:56,000
i put it on github and you can actually

03:08:55,040 --> 03:08:58,240
see the difference

03:08:56,000 --> 03:08:59,359
on github so if you're using code review

03:08:58,240 --> 03:09:01,840
and things like that

03:08:59,359 --> 03:09:03,279
you know that the additions are in green

03:09:01,840 --> 03:09:05,520
and deletions are in red

03:09:03,279 --> 03:09:07,680
so if you have a 3d file on github and

03:09:05,520 --> 03:09:09,760
you add a new version of the file

03:09:07,680 --> 03:09:14,080
you can see the changes that are made to

03:09:09,760 --> 03:09:16,560
that file in 3d and it was like

03:09:14,080 --> 03:09:18,399
it was like it was just so cool i think

03:09:16,560 --> 03:09:20,399
that's like one of the biggest things

03:09:18,399 --> 03:09:22,560
that even power users don't necessarily

03:09:20,399 --> 03:09:24,239
know and i think it's because like we

03:09:22,560 --> 03:09:26,000
were so ahead of the times when we

03:09:24,239 --> 03:09:26,960
released that feature so that feature

03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:30,000
was released

03:09:26,960 --> 03:09:32,000
back in 2013 and at the time not many

03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:33,600
people are getting into 3d printing and

03:09:32,000 --> 03:09:35,520
tinkering and stuff like that

03:09:33,600 --> 03:09:37,120
and and now it's just become so much

03:09:35,520 --> 03:09:40,080
bigger so i think we'll see

03:09:37,120 --> 03:09:40,640
a lot more people start to use um github

03:09:40,080 --> 03:09:42,960
for their

03:09:40,640 --> 03:09:46,080
3d version control which i'm really

03:09:42,960 --> 03:09:46,080
excited to see more of that

03:09:46,239 --> 03:09:49,600
perfect great well thanks mish for

03:11:11,840 --> 03:11:17,359
that you've loved over the past two days

03:11:14,239 --> 03:11:19,439
um sessions all the performances

03:11:17,359 --> 03:11:21,279
and even us i mean look at us we're

celebrating holly here

03:11:21,279 --> 03:11:26,399
right now um on two different ends of

03:11:23,520 --> 03:11:29,279
the world right current

03:11:26,399 --> 03:11:29,840
exactly exactly so you know what what's

03:11:29,279 --> 03:11:32,479
next

03:11:29,840 --> 03:11:34,160
um our next session is all about the

03:11:32,479 --> 03:11:36,560
state of ui ux

03:11:34,160 --> 03:11:38,399
in open source and it's basically an

03:11:36,560 --> 03:11:39,279
introduction to design systems and

03:11:38,399 --> 03:11:41,600
patterns

03:11:39,279 --> 03:11:42,479
and why they are relevant to your

03:11:41,600 --> 03:11:44,960
projects

03:11:42,479 --> 03:11:47,439
and hosting this session is going to be

03:11:44,960 --> 03:11:50,080
pranav raj who is a co-founder of

03:11:47,439 --> 03:11:50,960
chatwood and don't forget to engage on

03:11:50,080 --> 03:11:52,640

um all of your questions and then things

03:11:56,160 --> 03:11:58,880
that you want to ask him that there you

03:12:04,239 --> 03:12:19,600
about your session

03:12:06,960 --> 03:12:22,319
hey pronouns

03:12:19,600 --> 03:12:24,319
hi everyone my name is pranav i'm the

03:12:22,319 --> 03:12:26,239
ceo of chatfoot

03:12:24,319 --> 03:12:27,840
today i'm going to talk about the state

03:12:26,239 --> 03:12:31,439
of uiux in

03:12:27,840 --> 03:12:34,000
open source projects how you can drive

03:12:31,439 --> 03:12:35,200
design discussions and how you can

03:12:34,000 --> 03:12:38,640
actually promote

03:12:35,200 --> 03:12:39,279
a design first culture but before going

03:12:38,640 --> 03:12:41,439
into that

03:12:39,279 --> 03:12:42,640
let me introduce myself as i mentioned

03:12:41,439 --> 03:12:44,160
like you know i'm working on an open

03:12:42,640 --> 03:12:46,880
source project

03:12:44,160 --> 03:12:48,800
called chatwood i've been contributing

03:12:46,880 --> 03:12:51,760
to open source for about

03:12:48,800 --> 03:12:53,040
seven years now i started in 2014 uh

03:12:51,760 --> 03:12:55,680
through github like you know

03:12:53,040 --> 03:12:56,560
sales years was my first contribution uh

03:12:55,680 --> 03:12:58,560
from there

03:12:56,560 --> 03:13:01,279
uh it's been an amazing journey from an

03:12:58,560 --> 03:13:04,640
open source contributor to now to a

03:13:01,279 --> 03:13:08,080
open source uh maintainer uh

03:13:04,640 --> 03:13:09,920
so yeah and a little bit about chat wood

03:13:08,080 --> 03:13:11,520
we are building an open source customer

03:13:09,920 --> 03:13:14,160
engagement suite

03:13:11,520 --> 03:13:15,359
uh built as an alternative to intercom

03:13:14,160 --> 03:13:18,399
and zendesk

03:13:15,359 --> 03:13:21,439
we started in 2016 we started out as a

03:13:18,399 --> 03:13:22,239
proprietary software but it didn't work

03:13:21,439 --> 03:13:23,600
out well so

03:13:22,239 --> 03:13:26,800
after seeing the data privacy

03:13:23,600 --> 03:13:28,880
regulations uh people moving on to

03:13:26,800 --> 03:13:30,239
you know self-hosted alternatives we

03:13:28,880 --> 03:13:32,960
thought why don't we give this

03:13:30,239 --> 03:13:33,920
this a try and we oppose the project and

03:13:32,960 --> 03:13:36,160
to our surprise it

03:13:33,920 --> 03:13:37,120
got trending in hacker news and from

03:13:36,160 --> 03:13:39,520
there like you know we

03:13:37,120 --> 03:13:41,200
have been working for more than a year

03:13:39,520 --> 03:13:42,720
uh to build features

03:13:41,200 --> 03:13:44,560
and right now like you know we're

03:13:42,720 --> 03:13:46,640
building business out of it

03:13:44,560 --> 03:13:48,000
uh so go check out uh chat food on

03:13:46,640 --> 03:13:50,800
github and

03:13:48,000 --> 03:13:52,399
uh let us know uh your feedbacks uh we

03:13:50,800 --> 03:13:55,120
are open to contributions

03:13:52,399 --> 03:13:57,279
we're open to discussions yeah feel free

03:13:55,120 --> 03:14:00,319
to do it

03:13:57,279 --> 03:14:04,319
uh so before we jump into the uh

03:14:00,319 --> 03:14:05,920
actual topic let me discuss about

03:14:04,319 --> 03:14:07,359
the two different aspects like you know

03:14:05,920 --> 03:14:10,319
developer experience and

03:14:07,359 --> 03:14:11,600
product experience uh so as an open

03:14:10,319 --> 03:14:14,640
source projects

03:14:11,600 --> 03:14:18,080
it's it's really important for you to

03:14:14,640 --> 03:14:19,359
uh you know concentrate on the developer

03:14:18,080 --> 03:14:22,479
experience because like you know

03:14:19,359 --> 03:14:24,319
uh it really matters uh how

03:14:22,479 --> 03:14:26,239
like you know how it is easy to install

03:14:24,319 --> 03:14:28,160
the software or how hard

03:14:26,239 --> 03:14:29,359
uh is it to maintain or maybe like you

03:14:28,160 --> 03:14:31,279
know when there is a

03:14:29,359 --> 03:14:32,560
new version of the software how hard is

03:14:31,279 --> 03:14:35,600
it to upgrade

03:14:32,560 --> 03:14:38,080
these all things actually matters uh in

03:14:35,600 --> 03:14:40,640
your adoption so if you want to have

03:14:38,080 --> 03:14:41,680
better uh adoption uh you would have to

03:14:40,640 --> 03:14:44,720
make all these things

03:14:41,680 --> 03:14:46,239
simpler uh but like you know there is

03:14:44,720 --> 03:14:47,359
other aspect as well like you know the

03:14:46,239 --> 03:14:49,600
product experience

03:14:47,359 --> 03:14:50,720
uh so uh like you know how you use the

03:14:49,600 --> 03:14:53,040
product how

03:14:50,720 --> 03:14:54,080
well it actually solves the problem so

03:14:53,040 --> 03:14:55,920
today i'm

03:14:54,080 --> 03:14:57,520
i'm going to talk about products

03:14:55,920 --> 03:14:58,640
experience not about the developer

03:14:57,520 --> 03:15:01,439
experience

03:14:58,640 --> 03:15:02,960
uh so yeah i think like you know a

03:15:01,439 --> 03:15:03,840
design in open source projects is

03:15:02,960 --> 03:15:05,520
actually

03:15:03,840 --> 03:15:07,520
pretty debated topic because like you

03:15:05,520 --> 03:15:10,080
know most of the

03:15:07,520 --> 03:15:10,800
uh projects don't follow as standards or

03:15:10,080 --> 03:15:14,479
most of them

03:15:10,800 --> 03:15:16,479
actually uh you know don't have

03:15:14,479 --> 03:15:17,520
a guideline on how to contribute on

03:15:16,479 --> 03:15:19,600
design

03:15:17,520 --> 03:15:21,040
uh so like you know the the one of the

03:15:19,600 --> 03:15:22,880
reasons which we see

03:15:21,040 --> 03:15:24,399
uh for that is because like you know

03:15:22,880 --> 03:15:27,920
design and development are two

03:15:24,399 --> 03:15:30,800
independent processes um for

03:15:27,920 --> 03:15:31,359
designing a better user experience there

03:15:30,800 --> 03:15:33,439
needs

03:15:31,359 --> 03:15:35,120
a group of people with different set of

03:15:33,439 --> 03:15:37,680
skills working together

03:15:35,120 --> 03:15:38,800
uh towards a single goal uh i mean like

03:15:37,680 --> 03:15:41,279
you know their needs

03:15:38,800 --> 03:15:42,800
there needs to be you need to have like

03:15:41,279 --> 03:15:44,960
you know designers you need to have

03:15:42,800 --> 03:15:46,640
developers who can implement the design

03:15:44,960 --> 03:15:48,160
and they need to have like communicate

03:15:46,640 --> 03:15:50,080
between these like this should be a

03:15:48,160 --> 03:15:51,680
proper communication between these two

03:15:50,080 --> 03:15:53,920
and this is not happening in

03:15:51,680 --> 03:15:54,880
the open source projects so one of the

03:15:53,920 --> 03:15:57,120
things which

03:15:54,880 --> 03:15:58,640
i've understood from my experience

03:15:57,120 --> 03:16:00,080
working with designers in my previous

03:15:58,640 --> 03:16:00,800
jobs is that like you know most of them

03:16:00,080 --> 03:16:03,200
are

03:16:00,800 --> 03:16:04,880
problem solvers so they try to identify

03:16:03,200 --> 03:16:05,920
what exactly is the problem they try to

03:16:04,880 --> 03:16:08,479
understand

03:16:05,920 --> 03:16:10,319
how uh this problem is affecting the end

03:16:08,479 --> 03:16:11,359
customers and then from there like you

03:16:10,319 --> 03:16:13,359
know they

03:16:11,359 --> 03:16:14,560
work backwards to identify what's the

03:16:13,359 --> 03:16:17,120
right solution

03:16:14,560 --> 03:16:18,560
and build a user experience around that

03:16:17,120 --> 03:16:20,479
this is not happening

03:16:18,560 --> 03:16:22,160
uh anywhere in like you know any of the

03:16:20,479 --> 03:16:23,840
open source projects because one of the

03:16:22,160 --> 03:16:24,640
problem with that is like you know most

03:16:23,840 --> 03:16:26,479
of the

03:16:24,640 --> 03:16:28,000
uh designers who's new to the open

03:16:26,479 --> 03:16:28,800
source project might not have context

03:16:28,000 --> 03:16:30,880
about

03:16:28,800 --> 03:16:31,920
what people are asking so they need to

03:16:30,880 --> 03:16:33,439
set it up

03:16:31,920 --> 03:16:35,200
they need to like you know understand

03:16:33,439 --> 03:16:38,319
the product better it

03:16:35,200 --> 03:16:39,840
it takes a little bit of time uh to for

03:16:38,319 --> 03:16:42,840
them to actually do that

03:16:39,840 --> 03:16:45,920
and uh second thing is actually like you

03:16:42,840 --> 03:16:47,120
know uh the

03:16:45,920 --> 03:16:48,800
i mean like you know most of the open

03:16:47,120 --> 03:16:51,439
source products as we know like you know

03:16:48,800 --> 03:16:54,640
starts with one single developer who

03:16:51,439 --> 03:16:56,880
uh who had a problem so they like uh

03:16:54,640 --> 03:16:57,680
they wanted to like you know put some

03:16:56,880 --> 03:17:00,160
thought and then

03:16:57,680 --> 03:17:02,560
build a small hack or like you know a

03:17:00,160 --> 03:17:05,200
small product which solves their problem

03:17:02,560 --> 03:17:05,680
and then like uh they think like okay

03:17:05,200 --> 03:17:08,000
this

03:17:05,680 --> 03:17:09,600
is useful to me so why can't i open

03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:10,960
source it so they open source the

03:17:09,600 --> 03:17:12,000
product and afterwards like you know

03:17:10,960 --> 03:17:14,399
people

03:17:12,000 --> 03:17:15,520
uh like people see the product and then

03:17:14,399 --> 03:17:17,359
from there like you know they start

03:17:15,520 --> 03:17:18,479
adding more and more features to cater a

03:17:17,359 --> 03:17:22,160
large set of

03:17:18,479 --> 03:17:22,960
uh uses uh so one of the typical

03:17:22,160 --> 03:17:26,000
problems

03:17:22,960 --> 03:17:28,319
uh which comes to the projects is that

03:17:26,000 --> 03:17:29,920
like you know since it's not built for a

03:17:28,319 --> 03:17:33,040
larger audience

03:17:29,920 --> 03:17:36,319
uh i mean like they tend to have

03:17:33,040 --> 03:17:38,160
uh like you know ux that incurred due to

03:17:36,319 --> 03:17:39,600
various reasons one is actually like you

03:17:38,160 --> 03:17:41,439
know most people

03:17:39,600 --> 03:17:43,200
who would ask you like you know why

03:17:41,439 --> 03:17:45,200
don't you do x

03:17:43,200 --> 03:17:47,279
to do y or like you know why don't you

03:17:45,200 --> 03:17:49,520
add an option to do something

03:17:47,279 --> 03:17:51,439
so as a as a maintainer you want

03:17:49,520 --> 03:17:52,160
adoption as a maintainer you want more

03:17:51,439 --> 03:17:54,080
people

03:17:52,160 --> 03:17:55,439
to be using your product so the

03:17:54,080 --> 03:17:56,319
immediate thought or like you know the

03:17:55,439 --> 03:18:00,080
immediate

03:17:56,319 --> 03:18:03,040
uh uh uh understanding for you would be

03:18:00,080 --> 03:18:04,080
uh to create uh an option for them like

03:18:03,040 --> 03:18:05,279
you know so that like you know they can

03:18:04,080 --> 03:18:08,319
use the product

03:18:05,279 --> 03:18:09,520
and this keeps on adding like

03:18:08,319 --> 03:18:11,040
there will be like you know a lot of

03:18:09,520 --> 03:18:12,239
speeches there will be like like you

03:18:11,040 --> 03:18:13,600
know there'll be a lot of

03:18:12,239 --> 03:18:15,600
options which you provide so that like

03:18:13,600 --> 03:18:16,479
you know it it caters every set of

03:18:15,600 --> 03:18:18,720
people

03:18:16,479 --> 03:18:20,160
and the end result for that would be

03:18:18,720 --> 03:18:23,760
something like this like you know

03:18:20,160 --> 03:18:26,160
you you would have a smaller system

03:18:23,760 --> 03:18:27,439
with a lot of function options with a

03:18:26,160 --> 03:18:29,359
lot of controls

03:18:27,439 --> 03:18:30,479
which might not be relevant to most of

03:18:29,359 --> 03:18:33,760
the uses

03:18:30,479 --> 03:18:35,200
so one one one problem with this is

03:18:33,760 --> 03:18:36,080
actually like you know most people would

03:18:35,200 --> 03:18:39,040
have

03:18:36,080 --> 03:18:39,680
uh uh don't won't understand like you

03:18:39,040 --> 03:18:42,160
know

03:18:39,680 --> 03:18:42,800
why these many options are provided or

03:18:42,160 --> 03:18:46,000
like you know

03:18:42,800 --> 03:18:47,279
why this uh like this elaborate set of

03:18:46,000 --> 03:18:49,279
like you know options this

03:18:47,279 --> 03:18:51,359
is given in the in the product so it

03:18:49,279 --> 03:18:52,000
it's kind of a learning curve for them

03:18:51,359 --> 03:18:54,479
like you know

03:18:52,000 --> 03:18:55,840
it's not a good ux so if if you're not

03:18:54,479 --> 03:18:56,960
doing something complex if you're not

03:18:55,840 --> 03:18:59,200
doing something

03:18:56,960 --> 03:19:00,160
uh like you know like the one which we

03:18:59,200 --> 03:19:04,239
see in this

03:19:00,160 --> 03:19:05,120
image uh so like try to minimize that

03:19:04,239 --> 03:19:07,520
and like you know

03:19:05,120 --> 03:19:09,200
it's really important to understand that

03:19:07,520 --> 03:19:11,439
you don't have to provide

03:19:09,200 --> 03:19:13,120
every option which every customer or

03:19:11,439 --> 03:19:14,560
like you know every developer is asking

03:19:13,120 --> 03:19:17,920
you on github

03:19:14,560 --> 03:19:18,560
you can always say that like why don't

03:19:17,920 --> 03:19:20,880
you just

03:19:18,560 --> 03:19:22,640
 the project and then make make

03:19:20,880 --> 03:19:23,200
option by yourself so that you can use

03:19:22,640 --> 03:19:25,439
it so

03:19:23,200 --> 03:19:26,560
it doesn't make sense for you to add

03:19:25,439 --> 03:19:28,560
every set of features

03:19:26,560 --> 03:19:30,960
every set of options which people are

03:19:28,560 --> 03:19:33,040
requesting so every time you

03:19:30,960 --> 03:19:34,319
uh you get a request that like you know

03:19:33,040 --> 03:19:37,680
add a functionality

03:19:34,319 --> 03:19:39,600
add an option to uh to do this

03:19:37,680 --> 03:19:41,359
just think about whether this is going

03:19:39,600 --> 03:19:43,200
to create a ux debt

03:19:41,359 --> 03:19:44,640
or whether it's going to create more and

03:19:43,200 --> 03:19:48,479
more problem

03:19:44,640 --> 03:19:51,439
on on on our end then

03:19:48,479 --> 03:19:53,200
like then after that like you know if

03:19:51,439 --> 03:19:54,880
you think this is going to be a problem

03:19:53,200 --> 03:19:57,359
this is not going to be a

03:19:54,880 --> 03:19:58,840
useful feature for a lot of people who

03:19:57,359 --> 03:20:01,520
are using your product

03:19:58,840 --> 03:20:02,160
then uh don't do it like you know just

03:20:01,520 --> 03:20:04,399
say that

03:20:02,160 --> 03:20:05,359
you can customize it like this you can

03:20:04,399 --> 03:20:07,040
do changes

03:20:05,359 --> 03:20:08,960
change the code like this and you can do

03:20:07,040 --> 03:20:10,640
it yourself so

03:20:08,960 --> 03:20:12,880
this happens to me all the time in chat

03:20:10,640 --> 03:20:14,640
wood because most people like you know

03:20:12,880 --> 03:20:16,319
we have a broader product like with a

03:20:14,640 --> 03:20:17,200
lot of options a lot of customizations

03:20:16,319 --> 03:20:19,439
available

03:20:17,200 --> 03:20:20,239
uh so people would come to say that i

03:20:19,439 --> 03:20:22,560
come and say that

03:20:20,239 --> 03:20:24,000
you know i want this kind of thing for

03:20:22,560 --> 03:20:27,120
this use case

03:20:24,000 --> 03:20:28,800
and yeah like as a developer the

03:20:27,120 --> 03:20:30,560
maintainer of the project i

03:20:28,800 --> 03:20:32,560
my immediate reaction is like oh yeah i

03:20:30,560 --> 03:20:34,720
think i can provide that but

03:20:32,560 --> 03:20:35,680
uh most of the time like you know i take

03:20:34,720 --> 03:20:37,760
a step back like

03:20:35,680 --> 03:20:40,080
talk to uh the people who are working on

03:20:37,760 --> 03:20:41,760
the project like understand whether

03:20:40,080 --> 03:20:43,120
this is something that's relevant for

03:20:41,760 --> 03:20:45,920
the larger uh

03:20:43,120 --> 03:20:47,760
set of people uh then if it's not then

03:20:45,920 --> 03:20:49,359
we would defer that or maybe ask the

03:20:47,760 --> 03:20:50,160
person to actually you know build it

03:20:49,359 --> 03:20:51,439
themselves

03:20:50,160 --> 03:20:53,359
because it's open source right like you

03:20:51,439 --> 03:20:54,239
know you can uh you can build it out

03:20:53,359 --> 03:20:57,359
yourself you can

03:20:54,239 --> 03:20:58,560
uh like you can change the code which is

03:20:57,359 --> 03:21:00,640
uh which is one of those things which

03:20:58,560 --> 03:21:03,920
you would want to do

03:21:00,640 --> 03:21:05,200
if it is not possible to uh

03:21:03,920 --> 03:21:07,439
remove that option let's say like you

03:21:05,200 --> 03:21:08,160
know you have uh even though like you

03:21:07,439 --> 03:21:11,279
know

03:21:08,160 --> 03:21:14,080
even if you have like uh two options

03:21:11,279 --> 03:21:15,760
with two uh like two two type of

03:21:14,080 --> 03:21:18,800
different options with two

03:21:15,760 --> 03:21:20,239
uh yes or no answers there you have like

03:21:18,800 --> 03:21:22,160
four possibilities think about like you

03:21:20,239 --> 03:21:22,800
know 20 different options with like you

03:21:22,160 --> 03:21:25,200
know

03:21:22,800 --> 03:21:25,840
uh 20 different like uh yes or no

03:21:25,200 --> 03:21:27,760
questions like

03:21:25,840 --> 03:21:29,040
there will be like a lot of options

03:21:27,760 --> 03:21:30,319
there will be a lot of combinations

03:21:29,040 --> 03:21:33,520
which you have to

03:21:30,319 --> 03:21:35,200
provide so most of the times don't

03:21:33,520 --> 03:21:37,680
add the future right away just like you

03:21:35,200 --> 03:21:40,319
know think about whether you can

03:21:37,680 --> 03:21:42,160
ask the person to say that like you know

03:21:40,319 --> 03:21:43,920
whether they can build it themselves

03:21:42,160 --> 03:21:46,080
if it is not possible if you think that

03:21:43,920 --> 03:21:49,279
this is something which is going to be

03:21:46,080 --> 03:21:50,880
useful for a larger set of uses and

03:21:49,279 --> 03:21:52,640
still you would have to provide a

03:21:50,880 --> 03:21:54,319
standard default right

03:21:52,640 --> 03:21:56,080
so if you look at like zoom as an

03:21:54,319 --> 03:21:58,560
example uh so the

03:21:56,080 --> 03:21:59,680
the way we are uh entering a meeting

03:21:58,560 --> 03:22:02,160
it's just one click

03:21:59,680 --> 03:22:03,439
but if you want to customize uh a

03:22:02,160 --> 03:22:05,439
specific thing like the way

03:22:03,439 --> 03:22:07,279
it's being recorded or like you know the

03:22:05,439 --> 03:22:09,279
uh like the video

03:22:07,279 --> 03:22:10,399
quality or like the audio quality it's

03:22:09,279 --> 03:22:13,359
all there

03:22:10,399 --> 03:22:15,279
but it's it all have like it the all

03:22:13,359 --> 03:22:16,960
those options have a standard default

03:22:15,279 --> 03:22:18,960
so that like you know a new user comes

03:22:16,960 --> 03:22:20,560
in or the person who wants to try out

03:22:18,960 --> 03:22:23,279
the product has

03:22:20,560 --> 03:22:25,040
a very simple uh step to do that like

03:22:23,279 --> 03:22:27,840
you know install the software

03:22:25,040 --> 03:22:29,520
just click on uh like in a login and

03:22:27,840 --> 03:22:30,399
then click on start a meeting then you

03:22:29,520 --> 03:22:32,800
have that

03:22:30,399 --> 03:22:33,600
particular uh you know meeting opened

03:22:32,800 --> 03:22:35,200
right so

03:22:33,600 --> 03:22:36,800
you have to pro you have to think like

03:22:35,200 --> 03:22:38,960
that where you

03:22:36,800 --> 03:22:40,880
you have to provide a standard default

03:22:38,960 --> 03:22:42,640
for all the options which you provide

03:22:40,880 --> 03:22:44,960
so that like you know whenever a person

03:22:42,640 --> 03:22:46,960
comes in like it's it's very easy to

03:22:44,960 --> 03:22:48,080
get started with the project and try to

03:22:46,960 --> 03:22:50,560
use the project so we

03:22:48,080 --> 03:22:52,560
we do this at chat road a lot uh we have

03:22:50,560 --> 03:22:54,479
a standard defaults for most of the

03:22:52,560 --> 03:22:55,760
cases which we recover even though like

03:22:54,479 --> 03:22:56,399
you know there is a customizability

03:22:55,760 --> 03:22:58,239
option

03:22:56,399 --> 03:23:01,120
we prefer to have a standard default for

03:22:58,239 --> 03:23:03,439
all options which we provide

03:23:01,120 --> 03:23:05,680
second problem here is actually this

03:23:03,439 --> 03:23:09,279
lack of standardization

03:23:05,680 --> 03:23:12,479
of design uh so

03:23:09,279 --> 03:23:14,080
all right uh so the all the design

03:23:12,479 --> 03:23:15,920
all the open source projects like you

03:23:14,080 --> 03:23:16,720
know if you look at them it's it's

03:23:15,920 --> 03:23:18,239
mostly like

03:23:16,720 --> 03:23:19,600
as i mentioned like you know a developer

03:23:18,239 --> 03:23:21,279
working on it and from there like

03:23:19,600 --> 03:23:23,760
building features out of it

03:23:21,279 --> 03:23:24,399
so uh there is a lack of like you know

03:23:23,760 --> 03:23:26,720
design

03:23:24,399 --> 03:23:28,000
uh design first thinking uh what i mean

03:23:26,720 --> 03:23:31,359
by that is

03:23:28,000 --> 03:23:33,760
uh like if you look at uh any of the

03:23:31,359 --> 03:23:34,560
uh like web projects out there it's like

03:23:33,760 --> 03:23:36,080
you know there will be

03:23:34,560 --> 03:23:37,840
10 different types of buttons you can

03:23:36,080 --> 03:23:39,600
see or 10 different spacing you can see

03:23:37,840 --> 03:23:42,800
or maybe like you know you can even see

03:23:39,600 --> 03:23:44,239
people writing uh styles in line so

03:23:42,800 --> 03:23:46,080
one of the problems with that is like

03:23:44,239 --> 03:23:48,160
you know as a designer if somebody comes

03:23:46,080 --> 03:23:49,520
to your project and even like there are

03:23:48,160 --> 03:23:51,600
different barriers for them to actually

03:23:49,520 --> 03:23:53,840
like you know try and use the product

03:23:51,600 --> 03:23:55,359
even then like you know if they did all

03:23:53,840 --> 03:23:57,439
those the first thing which they are

03:23:55,359 --> 03:23:59,359
going to see is like you know the

03:23:57,439 --> 03:24:01,359
the design itself is like not

03:23:59,359 --> 03:24:04,160
standardized or maybe like you know

03:24:01,359 --> 03:24:05,120
don't have a guideline which is written

03:24:04,160 --> 03:24:07,840
anywhere

03:24:05,120 --> 03:24:09,359
so their posts uh thought process would

03:24:07,840 --> 03:24:09,840
be like you know why don't i contribute

03:24:09,359 --> 03:24:12,319
to this

03:24:09,840 --> 03:24:13,040
why don't i contribute to uh the base

03:24:12,319 --> 03:24:16,160
design like

03:24:13,040 --> 03:24:17,279
make it better uh but often it ends up

03:24:16,160 --> 03:24:18,479
like you know changing a lot of

03:24:17,279 --> 03:24:20,800
variables which

03:24:18,479 --> 03:24:22,800
uh might not be the right thing for uh

03:24:20,800 --> 03:24:25,680
the developer because like it's a lot of

03:24:22,800 --> 03:24:27,359
work for them to change all this and

03:24:25,680 --> 03:24:29,040
like make it standardize and they would

03:24:27,359 --> 03:24:31,120
end up like you know rejecting

03:24:29,040 --> 03:24:32,960
uh the proposal which which might be

03:24:31,120 --> 03:24:34,560
like frustrating for the designer so

03:24:32,960 --> 03:24:37,120
uh before you start like you know think

03:24:34,560 --> 03:24:40,000
about how you can uh standardize

03:24:37,120 --> 03:24:41,040
the the uh like you know the options

03:24:40,000 --> 03:24:41,600
which you take like you know one of the

03:24:41,040 --> 03:24:44,640
easiest

03:24:41,600 --> 03:24:46,640
examples is to take uh uh one of the

03:24:44,640 --> 03:24:48,399
frameworks like you know tailwind or a

03:24:46,640 --> 03:24:50,720
bootstrap or foundation like you know

03:24:48,399 --> 03:24:51,600
take that as an example take that as a

03:24:50,720 --> 03:24:54,080
base

03:24:51,600 --> 03:24:56,080
uh style guide for you and then from

03:24:54,080 --> 03:24:59,840
there build on top of that

03:24:56,080 --> 03:25:01,040
make the uh colors uh with with respect

03:24:59,840 --> 03:25:04,160
to your brand made

03:25:01,040 --> 03:25:05,279
make uh spacing with based on based on

03:25:04,160 --> 03:25:08,239
what you require

03:25:05,279 --> 03:25:09,359
and use the standard colors or spacing

03:25:08,239 --> 03:25:11,840
or like you know whatever is

03:25:09,359 --> 03:25:13,439
whatever you are using inside your

03:25:11,840 --> 03:25:14,319
project like you know make it a standard

03:25:13,439 --> 03:25:18,239
put it somewhere

03:25:14,319 --> 03:25:19,760
in a common place so that everyone who

03:25:18,239 --> 03:25:21,680
like you know who is interacting with

03:25:19,760 --> 03:25:23,200
the product knows that like you know

03:25:21,680 --> 03:25:25,439
this is the place i can go

03:25:23,200 --> 03:25:26,239
and look at uh what is the standard

03:25:25,439 --> 03:25:29,200
being set

03:25:26,239 --> 03:25:30,880
so uh this is what is called like you

03:25:29,200 --> 03:25:32,800
know design force culture like you know

03:25:30,880 --> 03:25:34,080
whenever a new person comes in or like

03:25:32,800 --> 03:25:36,239
you know whenever a new

03:25:34,080 --> 03:25:37,600
uh a new kind of like designer who wants

03:25:36,239 --> 03:25:40,239
to install

03:25:37,600 --> 03:25:41,520
or like you know use the software it is

03:25:40,239 --> 03:25:43,680
easier for them to

03:25:41,520 --> 03:25:44,880
see what's already there like you know

03:25:43,680 --> 03:25:47,600
it's it makes it

03:25:44,880 --> 03:25:48,800
less complex for them to understand what

03:25:47,600 --> 03:25:52,000
are the standards

03:25:48,800 --> 03:25:54,479
that are being set so we

03:25:52,000 --> 03:25:56,640
when we started chatwood uh we were

03:25:54,479 --> 03:26:00,000
thinking about like you know how we can

03:25:56,640 --> 03:26:02,080
uh how we can like adopt this system

03:26:00,000 --> 03:26:03,920
like you know how we can

03:26:02,080 --> 03:26:06,080
adopt a design system or maybe like you

03:26:03,920 --> 03:26:08,720
know adopted a sign language so that

03:26:06,080 --> 03:26:09,680
it's easier for us to communicate with

03:26:08,720 --> 03:26:11,680
other people

03:26:09,680 --> 03:26:14,160
so we started searching for the options

03:26:11,680 --> 03:26:14,880
it was in 2016 design system was not a

03:26:14,160 --> 03:26:16,560
thing

03:26:14,880 --> 03:26:19,040
uh but like there was a good guide

03:26:16,560 --> 03:26:20,800
written by marvel at that point

03:26:19,040 --> 03:26:23,040
so we started from there like you know

03:26:20,800 --> 03:26:23,680
we took their uh design system as an

03:26:23,040 --> 03:26:25,600
example

03:26:23,680 --> 03:26:26,880
and from there we built our own

03:26:25,600 --> 03:26:28,880
standards like you know we have our own

03:26:26,880 --> 03:26:29,600
typography we have our own phones we

03:26:28,880 --> 03:26:31,520
have

03:26:29,600 --> 03:26:33,200
our own spacing or like you know even

03:26:31,520 --> 03:26:34,880
colors like we customize all those

03:26:33,200 --> 03:26:37,520
things but like the base

03:26:34,880 --> 03:26:37,920
idea or like the base layout was taken

03:26:37,520 --> 03:26:41,200
from

03:26:37,920 --> 03:26:43,760
other examples so you right now they

03:26:41,200 --> 03:26:45,120
all of the companies are like all of the

03:26:43,760 --> 03:26:47,200
products which is out there

03:26:45,120 --> 03:26:48,319
who have who have certain set of

03:26:47,200 --> 03:26:50,479
guidelines

03:26:48,319 --> 03:26:52,160
would follow some kind of design system

03:26:50,479 --> 03:26:54,160
and to be honest like you know

03:26:52,160 --> 03:26:55,600
i wouldn't i wouldn't recommend anyone

03:26:54,160 --> 03:26:56,640
to just like follow bootstrap because

03:26:55,600 --> 03:26:59,439
like you know

03:26:56,640 --> 03:27:00,560
it gets worse when like you have a lot

03:26:59,439 --> 03:27:02,880
of components

03:27:00,560 --> 03:27:03,920
and there is no way to actually like you

03:27:02,880 --> 03:27:05,680
know

03:27:03,920 --> 03:27:07,120
make a standard or like there is no way

03:27:05,680 --> 03:27:10,960
to for you to

03:27:07,120 --> 03:27:12,399
uh build a standard just by bootstrap so

03:27:10,960 --> 03:27:14,080
it's more about like you know the

03:27:12,399 --> 03:27:16,239
the culture which you building like you

03:27:14,080 --> 03:27:17,600
know think about standards think about

03:27:16,239 --> 03:27:18,560
like you know a design system how you

03:27:17,600 --> 03:27:21,920
can adopt it like

03:27:18,560 --> 03:27:25,279
go check out like different options um

03:27:21,920 --> 03:27:27,279
like primer or primer is actually like

03:27:25,279 --> 03:27:28,960
you know the design system for github

03:27:27,279 --> 03:27:31,120
um and you can actually go to

03:27:28,960 --> 03:27:31,520
refactoring ui which is a great book

03:27:31,120 --> 03:27:34,720
which

03:27:31,520 --> 03:27:35,840
you should follow uh uh which

03:27:34,720 --> 03:27:37,279
like you know even if you are a

03:27:35,840 --> 03:27:38,880
developer or if you even if you're

03:27:37,279 --> 03:27:40,319
someone who don't have who have not

03:27:38,880 --> 03:27:42,399
worked much in design

03:27:40,319 --> 03:27:43,920
that would actually help you uh to

03:27:42,399 --> 03:27:46,160
understand like you know

03:27:43,920 --> 03:27:46,960
like it it would help you to get started

03:27:46,160 --> 03:27:50,160
and understand

03:27:46,960 --> 03:27:52,239
how things work uh so and second

03:27:50,160 --> 03:27:53,680
and and like and one of the options

03:27:52,239 --> 03:27:55,439
which you can do is actually like you

03:27:53,680 --> 03:27:57,359
know document the design choices what

03:27:55,439 --> 03:27:58,479
colors you choose what's uh

03:27:57,359 --> 03:28:00,319
what are the components which is

03:27:58,479 --> 03:28:01,120
available in your projects like you know

03:28:00,319 --> 03:28:02,880
how

03:28:01,120 --> 03:28:04,560
what are the different type of options

03:28:02,880 --> 03:28:06,640
available so that

03:28:04,560 --> 03:28:07,680
whenever you whenever a new person comes

03:28:06,640 --> 03:28:10,319
in you can

03:28:07,680 --> 03:28:11,680
define a process on how they can

03:28:10,319 --> 03:28:13,040
contribute to the project right like you

03:28:11,680 --> 03:28:14,399
know you already have

03:28:13,040 --> 03:28:15,640
all these things documented and we

03:28:14,399 --> 03:28:16,800
started this with

03:28:15,640 --> 03:28:18,960
styleguide.chatfoot.com

03:28:16,800 --> 03:28:20,000
so we started our experiments with that

03:28:18,960 --> 03:28:21,760
and right now like you know we are

03:28:20,000 --> 03:28:24,640
writing a guide so that

03:28:21,760 --> 03:28:26,720
how a new person who's interested in

03:28:24,640 --> 03:28:28,239
design can like you know look at how

03:28:26,720 --> 03:28:29,680
we are dealing with the design and then

03:28:28,239 --> 03:28:31,279
from there like you know they can

03:28:29,680 --> 03:28:34,960
contribute or maybe

03:28:31,279 --> 03:28:38,239
uh just take inspiration from

03:28:34,960 --> 03:28:39,200
so and the third problem which most of

03:28:38,239 --> 03:28:42,080
the people face

03:28:39,200 --> 03:28:42,479
who are designers they don't know how

03:28:42,080 --> 03:28:45,279
like

03:28:42,479 --> 03:28:46,640
how they can contribute where they can

03:28:45,279 --> 03:28:50,720
where they can contribute

03:28:46,640 --> 03:28:52,160
and what they can contribute so

03:28:50,720 --> 03:28:54,960
the first thing is actually like you

03:28:52,160 --> 03:28:57,120
know where they can contribute

03:28:54,960 --> 03:28:59,520
there is definitely a lack of

03:28:57,120 --> 03:29:01,680
understanding or awareness about tooling

03:28:59,520 --> 03:29:03,120
so github as you say like you know or

03:29:01,680 --> 03:29:06,160
even open source projects

03:29:03,120 --> 03:29:09,040
is mostly about code

03:29:06,160 --> 03:29:10,960
uh the the the amount of peop like you

03:29:09,040 --> 03:29:12,720
know the amount of people involving in

03:29:10,960 --> 03:29:13,840
open source projects who are designers

03:29:12,720 --> 03:29:16,000
is very less

03:29:13,840 --> 03:29:17,920
so and there is a separate movement

03:29:16,000 --> 03:29:21,200
called open source design

03:29:17,920 --> 03:29:22,399
and stuff like that but uh the the core

03:29:21,200 --> 03:29:24,160
or like you know the most of the people

03:29:22,399 --> 03:29:27,200
who are working in open source would

03:29:24,160 --> 03:29:28,720
uh would are not designers and

03:29:27,200 --> 03:29:30,800
for designers like you know it's it's

03:29:28,720 --> 03:29:33,439
it's a big barrier for them to

03:29:30,800 --> 03:29:34,880
uh understand how github works or like

03:29:33,439 --> 03:29:37,040
you know or any other

03:29:34,880 --> 03:29:38,160
a git or svn or any other tools which

03:29:37,040 --> 03:29:41,040
you use

03:29:38,160 --> 03:29:42,640
uh that's first thing and there is no

03:29:41,040 --> 03:29:43,840
there's no like a way around it like no

03:29:42,640 --> 03:29:45,600
they have to learn it

03:29:43,840 --> 03:29:47,120
second is actually like you know even

03:29:45,600 --> 03:29:48,720
even if they come to

03:29:47,120 --> 03:29:50,560
they understand github and they come to

03:29:48,720 --> 03:29:53,200
your project

03:29:50,560 --> 03:29:53,600
they don't know what to contribute right

03:29:53,200 --> 03:29:54,960
like

03:29:53,600 --> 03:29:57,359
there will be a set of issues which

03:29:54,960 --> 03:29:58,319
might be highly technical which is not

03:29:57,359 --> 03:30:01,359
really

03:29:58,319 --> 03:30:02,960
uh really good to understand so you have

03:30:01,359 --> 03:30:05,520
to define

03:30:02,960 --> 03:30:06,960
an issue which describes what is

03:30:05,520 --> 03:30:08,720
expectation here

03:30:06,960 --> 03:30:10,560
what are the kind of things which you

03:30:08,720 --> 03:30:11,359
would want to build and like you know

03:30:10,560 --> 03:30:13,439
what can

03:30:11,359 --> 03:30:15,120
we contribute or like what can external

03:30:13,439 --> 03:30:16,000
people contribute to that particular

03:30:15,120 --> 03:30:17,520
issue

03:30:16,000 --> 03:30:18,720
most of the times like if you go to any

03:30:17,520 --> 03:30:20,239
of the open source projects it will be

03:30:18,720 --> 03:30:22,800
like you know there'll be a log

03:30:20,239 --> 03:30:25,200
and then okay this is not working for me

03:30:22,800 --> 03:30:27,520
and this is why this is happening so

03:30:25,200 --> 03:30:29,040
easy there is no easy way to filter out

03:30:27,520 --> 03:30:30,640
these kind of issues

03:30:29,040 --> 03:30:33,439
just to make sure that like you know i

03:30:30,640 --> 03:30:35,680
have a design problem which

03:30:33,439 --> 03:30:37,359
like you know you can solve there is no

03:30:35,680 --> 03:30:40,000
there's no easy way to do that

03:30:37,359 --> 03:30:42,239
so like one of the things which you want

03:30:40,000 --> 03:30:44,880
to do is like you know define

03:30:42,239 --> 03:30:46,160
a process on how you can contribute to

03:30:44,880 --> 03:30:48,479
design

03:30:46,160 --> 03:30:49,840
so first thing is to write down the

03:30:48,479 --> 03:30:53,040
expectations

03:30:49,840 --> 03:30:55,040
have a proper uh product spec so let's

03:30:53,040 --> 03:30:57,120
say you're building a teams feature

03:30:55,040 --> 03:30:58,160
write down a product spec understand

03:30:57,120 --> 03:31:01,439
what uh

03:30:58,160 --> 03:31:03,279
what this feature means to you then

03:31:01,439 --> 03:31:04,800
create different types of options which

03:31:03,279 --> 03:31:07,520
is available like or

03:31:04,800 --> 03:31:09,439
different use cases which you can solve

03:31:07,520 --> 03:31:11,760
and from there

03:31:09,439 --> 03:31:13,359
label the issues right like you know if

03:31:11,760 --> 03:31:15,600
you have the product spec complete

03:31:13,359 --> 03:31:16,880
next you want is a high level design

03:31:15,600 --> 03:31:17,920
maybe people can contribute like you

03:31:16,880 --> 03:31:19,840
know it can be

03:31:17,920 --> 03:31:21,760
uh it can be about civic mockup or it

03:31:19,840 --> 03:31:22,479
can be a figma design it can be anything

03:31:21,760 --> 03:31:24,880
like you know

03:31:22,479 --> 03:31:26,160
just to contribute to the design label

03:31:24,880 --> 03:31:28,319
the issues correctly

03:31:26,160 --> 03:31:30,640
so that people can find it so first

03:31:28,319 --> 03:31:32,080
thing you you want to do is like you

03:31:30,640 --> 03:31:34,479
know label them properly with

03:31:32,080 --> 03:31:36,080
design wanted or something of that sort

03:31:34,479 --> 03:31:37,760
and third is actually like you know have

03:31:36,080 --> 03:31:40,880
a clear honor of the issue

03:31:37,760 --> 03:31:43,359
and define how you how you resolve

03:31:40,880 --> 03:31:44,960
conflicts so most most often like you

03:31:43,359 --> 03:31:46,880
know if there are two people

03:31:44,960 --> 03:31:48,720
who are working who saw the issue who

03:31:46,880 --> 03:31:50,960
wanted to contribute something then they

03:31:48,720 --> 03:31:52,720
comes with two different approaches

03:31:50,960 --> 03:31:54,000
there is a conflict and you have to

03:31:52,720 --> 03:31:56,160
define very

03:31:54,000 --> 03:31:57,920
clearly upfront that like you know this

03:31:56,160 --> 03:31:59,520
is the person who is owning this issue

03:31:57,920 --> 03:32:01,040
or like this is how this

03:31:59,520 --> 03:32:02,560
issue would be resolved if there are a

03:32:01,040 --> 03:32:04,640
conflicting opinion

03:32:02,560 --> 03:32:06,080
and from there uh you have to define

03:32:04,640 --> 03:32:07,359
that process as well like you know the

03:32:06,080 --> 03:32:09,439
understand

03:32:07,359 --> 03:32:10,960
like tell like write down in that

03:32:09,439 --> 03:32:11,600
particular issue that like you know this

03:32:10,960 --> 03:32:14,319
is how we

03:32:11,600 --> 03:32:15,040
accept contributions to this particular

03:32:14,319 --> 03:32:17,840
issue

03:32:15,040 --> 03:32:18,239
uh say you want to have these these many

03:32:17,840 --> 03:32:20,960
things

03:32:18,239 --> 03:32:21,439
and it should not uh follow these many

03:32:20,960 --> 03:32:24,160
things

03:32:21,439 --> 03:32:25,200
and it should follow your actual design

03:32:24,160 --> 03:32:27,279
contributions

03:32:25,200 --> 03:32:28,960
so like you know having that clear

03:32:27,279 --> 03:32:32,160
ownership and having that

03:32:28,960 --> 03:32:34,800
conflict or solution written inside

03:32:32,160 --> 03:32:35,279
uh issues is clearly important and i

03:32:34,800 --> 03:32:37,760
think like

03:32:35,279 --> 03:32:38,319
i can give an example of metabase uh so

03:32:37,760 --> 03:32:40,399
they

03:32:38,319 --> 03:32:41,600
uh if you if you look at their like

03:32:40,399 --> 03:32:42,399
contribution guidelines there is an

03:32:41,600 --> 03:32:44,160
option called

03:32:42,399 --> 03:32:45,439
uh there is a section where they define

03:32:44,160 --> 03:32:48,080
design the feature

03:32:45,439 --> 03:32:49,120
uh and in this like even though it's

03:32:48,080 --> 03:32:51,040
it's clearly

03:32:49,120 --> 03:32:52,399
it might it might be like you know their

03:32:51,040 --> 03:32:52,800
internal team working on it like you

03:32:52,399 --> 03:32:54,960
know

03:32:52,800 --> 03:32:57,680
it's very clear that these set of issues

03:32:54,960 --> 03:33:00,880
which are tagged with design needed

03:32:57,680 --> 03:33:02,399
is specifically for designs it's the ux

03:33:00,880 --> 03:33:05,920
is complete or like the

03:33:02,399 --> 03:33:08,080
uh the feature is actually uh understood

03:33:05,920 --> 03:33:10,399
like a feature is already written very

03:33:08,080 --> 03:33:12,160
clearly you have to understand how

03:33:10,399 --> 03:33:14,399
uh like there is a clear description of

03:33:12,160 --> 03:33:15,840
how the functionality would work

03:33:14,399 --> 03:33:17,680
and the next thing you want to do is

03:33:15,840 --> 03:33:20,399
like you know create a design for that

03:33:17,680 --> 03:33:21,279
so people can just go there filter out

03:33:20,399 --> 03:33:23,439
the label

03:33:21,279 --> 03:33:25,359
uh design needed then from there like

03:33:23,439 --> 03:33:26,560
you know they can contribute or maybe

03:33:25,359 --> 03:33:29,200
like you know they can

03:33:26,560 --> 03:33:30,160
provide suggestions which is not there

03:33:29,200 --> 03:33:33,200
in most of the

03:33:30,160 --> 03:33:34,720
problem most of the projects and the

03:33:33,200 --> 03:33:35,600
other way you can approach this is

03:33:34,720 --> 03:33:38,479
actually

03:33:35,600 --> 03:33:40,479
by uh you know having a process for

03:33:38,479 --> 03:33:42,319
design let's say like you know you have

03:33:40,479 --> 03:33:43,520
a set of components which is desired

03:33:42,319 --> 03:33:46,239
which is designed and

03:33:43,520 --> 03:33:46,640
you have a style guide return for it so

03:33:46,239 --> 03:33:50,960
you can

03:33:46,640 --> 03:33:52,960
either say uh if if the contribution

03:33:50,960 --> 03:33:54,399
if like you know if if you want to do

03:33:52,960 --> 03:33:56,239
something new in design

03:33:54,399 --> 03:33:57,600
just go to the cont like you know the

03:33:56,239 --> 03:33:59,279
style guide library

03:33:57,600 --> 03:34:01,120
see if the component is all already

03:33:59,279 --> 03:34:02,080
there if it is there then you can

03:34:01,120 --> 03:34:04,560
actually see

03:34:02,080 --> 03:34:05,359
whether uh you need to make any changes

03:34:04,560 --> 03:34:08,000
or if

03:34:05,359 --> 03:34:09,520
if if it is already like you know it

03:34:08,000 --> 03:34:10,960
already covers everything then you can

03:34:09,520 --> 03:34:13,359
just right away use that

03:34:10,960 --> 03:34:14,319
if it's not uh present if the component

03:34:13,359 --> 03:34:16,399
is not present

03:34:14,319 --> 03:34:18,080
then you can propose a new component

03:34:16,399 --> 03:34:19,920
design and if the component

03:34:18,080 --> 03:34:21,760
like you know you can have you can

03:34:19,920 --> 03:34:23,120
define all the steps like that so that

03:34:21,760 --> 03:34:25,840
like you know there is a

03:34:23,120 --> 03:34:27,200
written rule or like you know there is a

03:34:25,840 --> 03:34:30,160
process which is defined

03:34:27,200 --> 03:34:31,760
on how you accept design related

03:34:30,160 --> 03:34:32,399
contributions which makes it easier for

03:34:31,760 --> 03:34:33,760
people to

03:34:32,399 --> 03:34:35,760
contribute as well right like you know

03:34:33,760 --> 03:34:37,120
you go to a project you understand this

03:34:35,760 --> 03:34:37,760
is how you can contribute and then you

03:34:37,120 --> 03:34:40,880
can

03:34:37,760 --> 03:34:43,439
jump right in and then contribute so

03:34:40,880 --> 03:34:44,080
uh primer like as i mentioned github's

03:34:43,439 --> 03:34:46,160
uh

03:34:44,080 --> 03:34:47,920
uh tile guide is actually like you know

03:34:46,160 --> 03:34:48,880
they have well written document on

03:34:47,920 --> 03:34:50,319
contributing

03:34:48,880 --> 03:34:52,479
and maybe like you know you can actually

03:34:50,319 --> 03:34:56,000
explore other open source projects or

03:34:52,479 --> 03:34:58,239
other uh companies guidelines which

03:34:56,000 --> 03:34:59,760
gives you much better decisions and the

03:34:58,239 --> 03:35:00,239
last part of it is actually like you

03:34:59,760 --> 03:35:02,800
know

03:35:00,239 --> 03:35:03,760
we covered why this is happening how

03:35:02,800 --> 03:35:05,600
this is happening

03:35:03,760 --> 03:35:06,880
and what are the different things which

03:35:05,600 --> 03:35:08,880
you can do to

03:35:06,880 --> 03:35:10,080
improve design contributions now i'd

03:35:08,880 --> 03:35:13,279
like to talk about

03:35:10,080 --> 03:35:16,399
uh how to drive design discussions uh

03:35:13,279 --> 03:35:18,399
driving design discussions is a

03:35:16,399 --> 03:35:21,040
double-edged sword uh to be honest like

03:35:18,399 --> 03:35:23,680
you know you you either get a lot of

03:35:21,040 --> 03:35:26,239
good responses or you either get a lot

03:35:23,680 --> 03:35:28,239
of very bad responses and there is no

03:35:26,239 --> 03:35:30,239
uh way to like you know get around on

03:35:28,239 --> 03:35:31,600
that uh so you have to

03:35:30,239 --> 03:35:33,359
understand like you know whenever you

03:35:31,600 --> 03:35:38,640
start design discussions it can get

03:35:33,359 --> 03:35:41,279
very some kind of very minor

03:35:38,640 --> 03:35:41,760
colors or like you know some spacing but

03:35:41,279 --> 03:35:44,640
it

03:35:41,760 --> 03:35:45,120
like there is actually a way to uh way

03:35:44,640 --> 03:35:47,200
to

03:35:45,120 --> 03:35:48,720
provide design discussion first of all

03:35:47,200 --> 03:35:51,120
the thing is actually like you know

03:35:48,720 --> 03:35:52,000
whenever you write a feature put the

03:35:51,120 --> 03:35:54,880
mock-ups right

03:35:52,000 --> 03:35:56,319
inside the issue just take a screenshot

03:35:54,880 --> 03:35:58,000
put that in the issue so that like you

03:35:56,319 --> 03:36:01,359
know when people come to your

03:35:58,000 --> 03:36:02,080
your github go to issues click on one of

03:36:01,359 --> 03:36:04,080
the feature

03:36:02,080 --> 03:36:06,880
description like you know they see how

03:36:04,080 --> 03:36:08,399
this is going to be uh

03:36:06,880 --> 03:36:10,239
in like you know whenever when the com

03:36:08,399 --> 03:36:12,160
feature is completed right like

03:36:10,239 --> 03:36:13,920
at that point they might have some

03:36:12,160 --> 03:36:15,359
options so this is one of things which

03:36:13,920 --> 03:36:16,720
we did from very early on

03:36:15,359 --> 03:36:19,200
so that like you know whenever we have a

03:36:16,720 --> 03:36:21,359
design whenever we have a new feature

03:36:19,200 --> 03:36:23,680
which is going to be built we build the

03:36:21,359 --> 03:36:25,200
designs or build the modes in

03:36:23,680 --> 03:36:26,880
in figma from there like you take a

03:36:25,200 --> 03:36:28,239
screenshot and put that on the github

03:36:26,880 --> 03:36:31,279
issue and this

03:36:28,239 --> 03:36:32,160
drove a lot of uh comments and like you

03:36:31,279 --> 03:36:34,399
know a lot of

03:36:32,160 --> 03:36:35,760
discussions based on very particular

03:36:34,399 --> 03:36:37,920
things for example

03:36:35,760 --> 03:36:39,040
very particular on this one was like you

03:36:37,920 --> 03:36:40,880
know one of the things we

03:36:39,040 --> 03:36:42,080
which people suggested was to provide an

03:36:40,880 --> 03:36:44,080
option for them

03:36:42,080 --> 03:36:46,160
uh instead of like you know instead of

03:36:44,080 --> 03:36:49,520
like having a

03:36:46,160 --> 03:36:51,200
text area to add this consent uh they

03:36:49,520 --> 03:36:52,880
wanted to have a standardized concept

03:36:51,200 --> 03:36:54,720
like you know maybe just they can just

03:36:52,880 --> 03:36:56,800
change the variables or like their

03:36:54,720 --> 03:36:58,560
company name they can just use the user

03:36:56,800 --> 03:36:59,600
right away second thing people wanted

03:36:58,560 --> 03:37:01,600
was to add

03:36:59,600 --> 03:37:02,960
options for terms and conditions or like

03:37:01,600 --> 03:37:03,920
you know privacy policy which makes

03:37:02,960 --> 03:37:06,479
sense because

03:37:03,920 --> 03:37:07,920
at all like you know we are we are

03:37:06,479 --> 03:37:08,319
saying like you know you are accepting

03:37:07,920 --> 03:37:10,239
this

03:37:08,319 --> 03:37:12,720
and then you want to have all the links

03:37:10,239 --> 03:37:14,479
together and then

03:37:12,720 --> 03:37:16,399
that kind of things like you know drove

03:37:14,479 --> 03:37:17,279
discussions in us so maybe you can

03:37:16,399 --> 03:37:19,840
experiment with

03:37:17,279 --> 03:37:20,880
like you don't have to have a design

03:37:19,840 --> 03:37:23,920
like this you can just

03:37:20,880 --> 03:37:27,439
use uh balsamiq or maybe

03:37:23,920 --> 03:37:30,560
anything like or even like paper written

03:37:27,439 --> 03:37:32,560
mocks which uh which can actually drive

03:37:30,560 --> 03:37:34,399
discussion so

03:37:32,560 --> 03:37:35,600
driving design discussions might not

03:37:34,399 --> 03:37:38,720
really involve

03:37:35,600 --> 03:37:40,319
uh designers it involves people who are

03:37:38,720 --> 03:37:41,760
actually using the product so

03:37:40,319 --> 03:37:43,359
if you are building something out there

03:37:41,760 --> 03:37:44,960
you want to have a

03:37:43,359 --> 03:37:47,279
better understanding how people think

03:37:44,960 --> 03:37:48,960
about the feature you don't have to do

03:37:47,279 --> 03:37:50,319
user research in github because like you

03:37:48,960 --> 03:37:51,439
know your project is open source you can

03:37:50,319 --> 03:37:54,720
leverage that

03:37:51,439 --> 03:37:56,479
as your starting point create a feature

03:37:54,720 --> 03:37:58,160
if you request and then from there like

03:37:56,479 --> 03:37:59,760
you know put the design ask for

03:37:58,160 --> 03:38:02,800
contributions and

03:37:59,760 --> 03:38:04,640
there just explain

03:38:02,800 --> 03:38:06,160
very clearly what you're looking for and

03:38:04,640 --> 03:38:07,120
what kind of feedback you're looking for

03:38:06,160 --> 03:38:08,479
instead of like

03:38:07,120 --> 03:38:10,319
if you put something like this without

03:38:08,479 --> 03:38:12,080
that that direction what happens is like

03:38:10,319 --> 03:38:14,560
you know people say that okay this

03:38:12,080 --> 03:38:15,439
uh text or font price is very small or

03:38:14,560 --> 03:38:18,720
maybe like you know

03:38:15,439 --> 03:38:20,880
i want to have the heading bet larger

03:38:18,720 --> 03:38:22,239
instead of that give them clear

03:38:20,880 --> 03:38:23,760
direction on like you know what you're

03:38:22,239 --> 03:38:26,239
looking for as a feedback

03:38:23,760 --> 03:38:28,080
and if there is someone who was willing

03:38:26,239 --> 03:38:30,000
would provide that feedback

03:38:28,080 --> 03:38:32,000
so yeah i think like you know that's all

03:38:30,000 --> 03:38:33,199
that's all i had for today so basically

03:38:32,000 --> 03:38:36,319
like you know

03:38:33,199 --> 03:38:38,640
i define a process understand that

03:38:36,319 --> 03:38:39,760
you need to standardize at some point so

03:38:38,640 --> 03:38:41,040
why don't you start at

03:38:39,760 --> 03:38:43,359
the beginning itself like you know

03:38:41,040 --> 03:38:43,840
standardize your components standardize

03:38:43,359 --> 03:38:46,880
your

03:38:43,840 --> 03:38:48,399
uh your uh design system

03:38:46,880 --> 03:38:50,239
so that like you know people can just

03:38:48,399 --> 03:38:51,920
look at uh the designs and

03:38:50,239 --> 03:38:54,319
understand okay this is what this guy is

03:38:51,920 --> 03:38:56,080
actually doing from there if you have

03:38:54,319 --> 03:38:58,160
like standardized design if you have

03:38:56,080 --> 03:39:01,840
like a process which is involved in

03:38:58,160 --> 03:39:02,880
uh design contributions you can actually

03:39:01,840 --> 03:39:05,680
have

03:39:02,880 --> 03:39:06,160
a third thing where like you uh you just

03:39:05,680 --> 03:39:08,640
like

03:39:06,160 --> 03:39:10,000
ask for general public for feedback on

03:39:08,640 --> 03:39:13,439
specific options which would

03:39:10,000 --> 03:39:16,239
drive more and more design discussions

03:39:13,439 --> 03:39:17,279
so yeah i think that's all we had uh for

03:39:16,239 --> 03:39:19,040

cloud first mobile first strategy

03:47:22,560 --> 03:47:26,399
we have to be kind of very nimble and

03:47:25,359 --> 03:47:30,160
agile

03:47:26,399 --> 03:47:31,279
in our processes and we also need a

03:47:30,160 --> 03:47:33,439
cultural shift

03:47:31,279 --> 03:47:35,120
in terms of how we deliver our products

03:47:33,439 --> 03:47:37,359
and services

03:47:35,120 --> 03:47:39,680
our entire engineering processes and

03:47:37,359 --> 03:47:43,040
tools have undergone transformation

03:47:39,680 --> 03:47:44,560
using github and devops hundreds of

03:47:43,040 --> 03:47:47,520
software professionals now

03:47:44,560 --> 03:47:48,479
on github the conversation is shifting

03:47:47,520 --> 03:47:50,880
towards

03:47:48,479 --> 03:47:53,199
how do i engineer the code how do i

03:47:50,880 --> 03:47:55,920
internalize the best practices available

03:47:53,199 --> 03:47:55,920
in the industry

03:47:57,120 --> 03:48:01,120
thank you hari let me now talk about

03:47:59,680 --> 03:48:03,600
some of the programs that

03:48:01,120 --> 03:48:05,120
erica mentioned and i'm sure all of you

03:48:03,600 --> 03:48:08,080
are as excited as

03:48:05,120 --> 03:48:10,000
i am when we announced it yesterday and

03:48:08,080 --> 03:48:11,199
these programs are really going to drive

03:48:10,000 --> 03:48:13,439
the engagement for

03:48:11,199 --> 03:48:14,640
developer communities across students

03:48:13,439 --> 03:48:17,600
startups

03:48:14,640 --> 03:48:18,720
and the open source community many of

03:48:17,600 --> 03:48:20,800
you have already

03:48:18,720 --> 03:48:22,319
started applying for these programs i am

03:48:20,800 --> 03:48:24,080
so overwhelmed

03:48:22,319 --> 03:48:25,600
by the mails that we've received from

03:48:24,080 --> 03:48:28,319
each and every one of you over the last

03:48:25,600 --> 03:48:30,479
24 hours since we announced this i

03:48:28,319 --> 03:48:31,439
do request you to leverage these

03:48:30,479 --> 03:48:33,920
programs and

03:48:31,439 --> 03:48:34,800
give feedback a lot of these programs we

03:48:33,920 --> 03:48:36,319
have created

03:48:34,800 --> 03:48:38,319
over the last one year based on the

03:48:36,319 --> 03:48:41,439
feedback that each and every one of you

03:48:38,319 --> 03:48:43,040
gave on what you expect from github

03:48:41,439 --> 03:48:44,880
we are really looking forward to

03:48:43,040 --> 03:48:46,640
feedback coming our way for creating

03:48:44,880 --> 03:48:49,120
more such programs to drive the

03:48:46,640 --> 03:48:52,080
engagement with developers like yourself

03:48:49,120 --> 03:48:52,800
and the whole purpose of this is you

03:48:52,080 --> 03:48:57,040
know to get

03:48:52,800 --> 03:49:00,000
more and more developers on the platform

03:48:57,040 --> 03:49:00,880
there is a huge generational shift

03:49:00,000 --> 03:49:04,080
that's happening

03:49:00,880 --> 03:49:05,680
in the industry today with more than 500

03:49:04,080 --> 03:49:06,319
million applications that are slated to

03:49:05,680 --> 03:49:09,520
be written

03:49:06,319 --> 03:49:10,640
by 2023 which is more than the last 40

03:49:09,520 --> 03:49:13,040
years combined

03:49:10,640 --> 03:49:14,239
i think it's a great opportunity for

03:49:13,040 --> 03:49:16,399
open source

03:49:14,239 --> 03:49:18,000
for students who are stepping into the

03:49:16,399 --> 03:49:20,640
software development world

03:49:18,000 --> 03:49:22,640
and also for enterprises to leverage

03:49:20,640 --> 03:49:24,800
github to really build software

03:49:22,640 --> 03:49:26,720
and that's been our purpose ever since

03:49:24,800 --> 03:49:28,239
we started our operations last year to

03:49:26,720 --> 03:49:30,880
serve you better

03:49:28,239 --> 03:49:31,279
to be closer to what you would require

03:49:30,880 --> 03:49:33,120
from

03:49:31,279 --> 03:49:34,720
a platform like github as we push the

03:49:33,120 --> 03:49:37,359
boundaries of

03:49:34,720 --> 03:49:38,720
developing applications to move human

03:49:37,359 --> 03:49:41,359
progress

03:49:38,720 --> 03:49:42,239
so really excited to be here and in a

03:49:41,359 --> 03:49:44,640
way it's been

03:49:42,239 --> 03:49:46,399
great um doing this virtual session with

03:49:44,640 --> 03:49:47,279
you i can share that you know last year

03:49:46,399 --> 03:49:50,880
when we were

03:49:47,279 --> 03:49:53,359
kicking off um our operations we did our

03:49:50,880 --> 03:49:54,560
kickoff on valentine's day 14 february

03:49:53,359 --> 03:49:56,720
03:49:54,560 --> 03:49:58,399
it's so vivid in my mind uh it feels

03:49:56,720 --> 03:49:59,359
like 10 years but it's only been one

03:49:58,399 --> 03:50:02,319
year

03:49:59,359 --> 03:50:04,160
we were you know expecting 250 300

03:50:02,319 --> 03:50:06,319
people to show up and we had

03:50:04,160 --> 03:50:07,680
2 000 people show up at the event it was

03:50:06,319 --> 03:50:10,399
a physical event

03:50:07,680 --> 03:50:11,040
and we were overwhelmed by the love that

03:50:10,399 --> 03:50:13,680
we got

03:50:11,040 --> 03:50:15,520
from developers and i'm sure by now

03:50:13,680 --> 03:50:17,120
doing this virtual we were able to reach

03:50:15,520 --> 03:50:19,279
out to more and more developers

03:50:17,120 --> 03:50:20,720
across the length and breadth of india

03:50:19,279 --> 03:50:22,880
so really excited and

03:50:20,720 --> 03:50:25,680
i'm thankful that you were able to spend

03:50:22,880 --> 03:50:28,640
that time with us

03:50:25,680 --> 03:50:29,680
as a next step i would request that each

03:50:28,640 --> 03:50:32,080
of you

03:50:29,680 --> 03:50:33,920
follow our repository on github this is

03:50:32,080 --> 03:50:34,800
a public repository that we've created

03:50:33,920 --> 03:50:36,880
to share

03:50:34,800 --> 03:50:38,160
more details about three programs that

03:50:36,880 --> 03:50:40,880

03:50:43,120 --> 03:50:47,439
more programs and you can use the

03:50:45,279 --> 03:50:50,080
discussion boards to interact with

03:50:47,439 --> 03:50:50,640

operations

03:51:13,520 --> 03:51:16,880
for a community connected by code like
