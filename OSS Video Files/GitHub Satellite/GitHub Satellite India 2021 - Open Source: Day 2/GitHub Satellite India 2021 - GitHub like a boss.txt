00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,240
20 minutes so what i've done is i've

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,520
broken up these top tips

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,680
into four parts so the first one is

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,119
personalization we'll talk about how

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,920
you can make it hard work a little bit

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,000
better for you next one is collaboration

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,520
how to work really well with github for

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,240
your team whether that's a

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,719
developer focus or developer specific

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,479
team

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,240
or even how to work with non-developers

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,240
as well i'm going to talk about a little

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,360
bit about the way you work and how to

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,520
use github

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,759
in the various different forms for your

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,160
work and then obviously this is the open

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,760
source

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,239
channel so we're going to be talking

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,319
about some top tips on using github

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,760
for open source i mentioned we've only

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,840
got 20 minutes

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,360
so there's a lot more top tips in here

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,239
so if there's a top tip that you really

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,760
want to hear

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,319
make sure you put it in the discussions

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,560
and i'll try and answer it at the end

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,879
all right so personalization

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,280
personalization is something that people

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,599
love think about when you create a

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,760
social media profile for the first time

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,440
people love to personalize it you know

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,400
you add a photo you might add where

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,080
you're from

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,000
you might add a few different things

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,319
about yourself even when you're building

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,080
lego lots of people like to personalize

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,640
the way they do this i'm a big fan of

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,800
lego

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,239
um so i had to throw some lego into this

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,879
talk somewhere

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,720
um but like you can customize a lego

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,760
model or you can customize a social

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,239
media profile

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,000
you can customize github too now one of

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,000
the first ways you can do this or just

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,480
one way you can do this

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,760
is our profile reviews now this is

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,480
something that is

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,480
relatively new we launched it last year

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,560
and it's a really fun way for you to

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,680
customize and showcase

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,120
who you are and what you do on github

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,080
so you can add things like a little bio

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,840
about yourself

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,120
you can add some of the top projects

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,519
that you're working on or

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,360
like our good friend b dougie who also

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,040
works on the developer relations team

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,360
you can showcase other really cool

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,640
developers so here's his top eight

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,080
developers that he

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,040
put on his bio now the

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,080
profile review is really a sky's the

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,840
limit kind of

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,920
choose your own adventure you can do

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,720
anything you want on your profile really

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,000
and it's really really easy to set up so

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,239
it's a way to set it up

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,959
is if you head to your github profile

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,519
open up a repository with the same

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,280
name as your username when you do this

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,439
you'll get like a little pop-up here

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,840
saying this is a special repository

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,799
you've now found a way to make a profile

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,720
review

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,040
so that's how you create it and then you

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,040
can add anything you want into it

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,040
so really make it yourself this is

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,360
another really cool profile from one of

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,599
our

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,359
github stars and she's added this really

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,680
cool banner up on top

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,280
and a little bit about her now you might

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,280
have noticed from both the doggy's

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,840
profile and monica's profile

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,840
that there are like animations and gifs

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,080
now because your profile readme is

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,160
written completely in markdown

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,080
you can add anything you want that would

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,840
be considered in markdown so you can add

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,320
gifs you can add images

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,520
and you can add some video you can add

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,080
emojis like here or you can even add

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,520
games now this is the profile read me

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,080
from one of our hovers

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,800
tim and he's had this community chess

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,639
tournament

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,800
happening on his profile for me for a

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,240
while now so he's got this all running

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,160
with github actions

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,680
and you open up an issue which we'll

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,360
talk about a bit more in a minute

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,280
um but you open up and you can play this

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,240
community chess tournament literally on

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,919
his profile

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,919
so if you go to his profile you'll be

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,320
able to see this so i'll let you

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,120
find that one so if you uh have a look

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,240
for tim

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,160
verwell on github you might find it

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,759
now another way to customize github to

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,840
work really well for you

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,039
is to start looking at and checking out

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,520
notifications

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,639
now notifications if you've used any

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,960
kind of

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,320
platform before whether it's emails or

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,039
obviously if you've been using github

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,039
for a while

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,280
you'll notice really quickly that you'll

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,919
get a lot of notifications

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,360
every time someone comments on an issue

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,400
mentions you

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,919
talks about you makes a pull request

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,160
you'll get a notification

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,680
so this can sometimes be really

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,800
overwhelming and you can get a lot of

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,039
notifications

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,240
so one way to personalize github makeup

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,320
work better for you

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,600
is to start personalize some of these

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,800
notifications

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,880
so just recently we released a new way

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,800
for you to filter notifications so you

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,240
can now filter out notifications

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,160
by organization or author so for example

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,000
as cronin and anisha mentioned i work

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,199
for github right which means i'm part of

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,720
the github org

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,400
now because i do a few other things on

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,360
github i also have a few other orgs that

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,680
i'm part of

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,440
now when i'm working during my workday i

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,919
don't want notifications from all these

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,680
other orgs i only want the notifications

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,000
from github so i know what i'm working

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,840
on so i can go through my notifications

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,080
and filter out those notifications

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,840
by github now you can get to

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,560
notifications from almost

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,680
anywhere on your computer or on your

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,840
github profile

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,600
on github all you do is click the bell

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,759
up in the top right there

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,639
um so if you can get that from your

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,759
repair

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,400
your shoes from your profile

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,919
now one thing to note with notifications

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,919
that some people get a little bit

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,479
worried like oh my gosh i haven't

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,240
checked out my notifications for a while

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,759
if i go now and check them out there's

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,360
gonna be hundreds of thousands of

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,400
notifications and i don't wanna have to

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,680
deal with that

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,440
so if you haven't checked out your

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,919
notifications in a while

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,880
go to notifications and you'll get a

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,039
pop-up

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,400
and this will help you filter out all

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,520
those notifications that you've got

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,039
sitting in the backlog

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,039
again this is something new that we

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,479
launched because we thought that oh who

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,919
knows lots of people that are

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,840
not going and checking out their

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,280
notifications all the time what if we

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,360
give people away that if they haven't

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,280
visited their notifications for a while

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,720
we'll help you clean those up so don't

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,680
get scared about going and check out

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,240
your notifications

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,080
if you haven't seen them for a while now

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,520
what else plays into notifications

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,280
is reminders so if you are

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,880
part of a lot of organizations and

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,720
you're getting a lot of reminder or

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,639
sorry notifications on github

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,880
you might think oh i might actually miss

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,360
a really important notification

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,240
i might miss a task i might miss a

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,240
milestone

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,280
so how do i schedule a reminder or how

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,000
do i schedule

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,879
notification reminders you can do that

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,120
in github

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,319
you can actually connect your slack to

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,919
your github and you can receive

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,800
reminders in slack

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,560
not only that but you can choose which

00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,319
organizations you receive reminders for

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,360
now obviously i mentioned on i won't

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,639
forget so on my github slack channel i

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,120
only want to receive

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,720
reminder notifications on slack from

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,520
github not from all the other orgs that

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,520
i'm part of

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,879
so you can easily do that and all you do

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,440
is go to your settings

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,000
and scroll down to your scheduled

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,520
reminders and you'll be able to

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,120
check out your reminders there and

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,879
customize that a little bit

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,319
so if you have a look here you can check

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,560
it out you can customize it

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,319
make it specific for each organization

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,120
and really personalize it

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,479
for your type of experience so go and

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,560
check that out

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,599
now speaking of personalizing your

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,240
experience you probably would have

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,120
noticed

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,440
my last few slides have all been quite

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,120
bright and white and in your face and

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,640
you're probably like well this nice dark

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,680
background but the rest of it's really

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,839
white and bright

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,160
so something that we launched um that

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,160
our users were really asking for and

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,240
something that we launched at universe

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,000
last year and if you've been on social

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,800
media you probably would have seen it

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,200
is our github dark mode now this has

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,440
been

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,480
really really exciting people have been

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,360
absolutely

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,480
loving this phone this mode is now

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,720
available on

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,560
github.com and it's completely native

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,519
it's available across all our github

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,839
suite of

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,680
um products so go and check out dark

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,519
mode now it's really easy to check out

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,640
dart mode if you're on your profile

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,399
you'll see a little

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,680
switch button or a little toggle at the

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,080
top of your profile

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,440
you'll be able to switch to dark mode we

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,760
also have a new

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,519
dim mode which just got released and

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,839
announced last week

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,200
so if you haven't checked out dim mode

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,160
you might want to go check that out

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,480
it's a slightly different contrast um

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,360
like

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,800
less less dark so um like different

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,560
contrast you can see there so we've now

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,120
got a light mode a dark mode and a dim

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,800
mode

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,480
uh but i really like the dark mode it

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,040
really helps save your eyes

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,680
um you see this nice beautiful darkness

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,399
here

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,760
so uh to save our eyes for the rest of

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,080
my presentation

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,640
we're going to be using github in dark

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,320
mode so let's jump in

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,000
so one of the things people love about

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,399
using github is the type

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
of collaboration you can do on github

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,839
now if you've been using github as a

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,079
developer you'll probably know about a

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,800
lot about collaboration tools

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,920
like uh code review and merging and

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,000
things like that

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,000
now since a lot of people know about

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,240
those i thought we'd talk about a few of

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,839
the tools that we have as github

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,000
to collaborate which you might not

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,920
necessarily know about these also really

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,839
good ways to collaborate across your

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,040
entire organization

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,920
and the first line which is one of my

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,839
personal favorites is project boards

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,680
project boards are really great for

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,320
tracking the overall progress

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,320
of a particular project you can also use

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,880
it for a variety of different

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,519
reasons so so this one here is our

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,240
github

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,959
roadmap this is our public roadmap again

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,040
something

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,399
we launched last year out to the

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,720
community and you can

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,240
easily see at a glance what we're

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,480
releasing and when

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,000
so across the top of our project boards

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,480
we've got each quarter that's

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,320
uh coming up and the different features

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,040
and products that we're releasing across

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,880
that club

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,160
each one has an issue so you can click

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,040
on that and go and see

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,120
more happening on the project board now

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,560
this is a really good way to collaborate

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,240
with non-developers

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,839
because non-developers are often

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,560
familiar with this project board type

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,160
setup

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,920
there's lots of different ways to use

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,600
project boards too like we've obviously

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,040
used it here as a roadmap

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,120
but i've spoken to open source

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,519
maintainers who use it to track

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,160
different events that they've got coming

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,279
up i even use project boards myself

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,360
personally i have my own personal mish

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,000
list project but and it's got things

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,959
like

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,360
my shopping list and holidays i want to

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,600
go

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,440
on and other tasks that i might want to

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,760
track or projects i might be interested

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,079
in

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,600
so product boards are really up to you

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,760
and you can customize it

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,079
and really personalize it for you and

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,440
the way that you want to use it

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,680
now another really good way to

00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,160
collaborate with people is our

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,240
discussions you're obviously going to be

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,040
getting a first taste of discussions or

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,880
first-hand

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,240
taste of discussions if you're heading

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,480
over to discussions

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,519
during this talk or afterwards but it's

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,399
a really great way to communicate

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,519
chat collaborate and have a discussion

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,120
on github

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,040
so if you've been using github as a

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,920
developer for a while you probably know

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,760
that those

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,040
there's those issues that you have that

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,600
aren't really issues

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,920
they're more like discussions so now we

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,880
want to separate discussions from issues

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,600
we really wanted

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,880
issues to be a way for you to talk about

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,360
new features

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,279
new products and bug fixes and things

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,200
like that and then have discussions as a

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,720
way for you to chat and collaborate

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,560
now you can use discussions for a

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,519
variety of different things you can see

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,360
across the

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,800
um the side column there you can use

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,120
them for ideas

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,240
q and a's again i've chatted to some

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,920
project maintainers

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,279
asking what they what they use

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,560
discussions for

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,800
some of them said they even use

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,800
discussions for people within the org to

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,320
share their favorite holiday or surfing

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,440
destination i was like

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,440
that's really cool um but often

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,800
you can have these types of discussions

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,680
and really separate them from your

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,839
issues

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,440
now if you ever notice that an issue

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,920
that you've opened or someone else is

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,000
open

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,760
is becoming more of a discussion or a

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,320
chat or collaboration instead of an

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,800
issue

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,399
you can easily go and convert that issue

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,720
into a discussion

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,839
so here i opened up an issue to talk

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,360
about a logo

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,839
i was like i think we should get a new

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,040
logo um let's see what we're going to do

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,800
who we're going to get

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,200
and it became too much of a discussion

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,079
so i quickly went in and said yeah let's

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,639
convert this

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,000
to a discussion um and now as you can

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,160
see with our discussion

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,920
we can have thread of replies we have

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,680
forum style conversations

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,360
and we can keep all the chat and

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,480
discussion happening over here and

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,120
separate it out from our issues now

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,120
speaking of separating things and the

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,680
way that people work now

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,800
we really wanted developers and we

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,880
ourselves as

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,959
um people who use github and as

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,000
developers we like to work the way that

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,160
we want to

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,040
and at github we want to give you that

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,199
same power

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,639
we want you to use github the way that

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,279
you want to use it

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,680
um and so because of that we decided

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,680
that

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,440
we'd provide github in a number of

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,240
different formats a number of different

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,160
platforms

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,680
another a number of different ways that

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,279
you can use and engage

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,320
with github so one of those is github

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,560
for mobile

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,839
this allows you to take github with you

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,519
everywhere you go

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,800
now obviously not many people are

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,920
traveling at the moment but when you do

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,120
travel again

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,959
you'll be able to take your help with

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,120
you everywhere in your pocket it's

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,600
available on ios and android and you can

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,079
do

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,800
so much on mobile you can quickly

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,000
comment on an

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:47,120
issue review bug fixes merge code and

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,360
now as of uh probably

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,399
about a month ago or so now um you can

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,399
even have discussions on mobile as well

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,920
so the latest version was released last

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,240
week for mobile and even

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,399
includes release notes for github now so

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,240
make sure you go check those out

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,920
one of the things i love about mobile is

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,720
being able to quickly do something on

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,600
the fly

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,639
for example um if an issue gets opened

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,199
by my team

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,120
and it's you know 7 pm my time on a

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,880
friday i don't want to completely block

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,320
them over the weekend i can just quickly

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,079
comment on an issue

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,519
and quickly unblock them without having

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,160
to go to my computer

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,800
fire up github and go from there so

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,560
that's why i love mobile it's really fun

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,320
another one of my personal favorites

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,880
which some people have been loving too

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,040
is github desktop now i really like

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,279
github desktop it's available on

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,079
windows and mac os and it's a really

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,480
good way to

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,000
organize your repos so all you do is

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,759
drag and drop a repo into

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,199
github desktop and then you can manage

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,759
that repo from there

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,600
what github desktop does is it compares

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,680
the repo that you've got on your local

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,800
machine to the version in the cloud

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,959
um and me being not so familiar or

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,240
remembering different commands to fix

00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:00,000
github or you know have i merged my

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,079
thing yet you know is it

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,399
am i one step behind master on my

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,880
computer or main sorry

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,680
am i behind main on my computer is my

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,480
origin in front of my local copy

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,240
github desktop manages all that for me

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,120
so i love these big blue buttons that

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,079
come up like

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,759
oh you are one commit behind maine would

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,040
you like to pull in the origin and make

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,959
your local machine

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,320
uh pair up with what's on the cloud so

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,839
that's why i really love

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,680
desktop you know it's got all these nice

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,320
big blue buttons and toggle and push

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,839
commands

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,519
i don't have to really think about what

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,120
i need to do next um

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,360
so i love github desktop and as you can

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,920
see here it's available in dark mode

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,600
as well our theme github desktop is you

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,160
can go through the history of all your

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,000
files

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,480
and compare and view the changes so you

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,399
can see in red it's being deleted and in

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,480
green they're the added versions

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,519
so the latest version of github desktop

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,360
shipped on march

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,680
10th so make sure you're up to date with

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,880
github desktop to

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,199
enjoy all the fancy features we have now

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,240
if

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,120
mobile and desktop aren't your cup of

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,240
teas

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,240
maybe you'll like our cli so last year

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,880
we launched the github cli

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,240
and developers have been loving our cli

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,439
being able to use

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:16,079
and seamlessly work in one window so

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,039
github cli allows you to do so many

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,839
different things

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,439
you can create view and edit issues

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,000
directly from the cli

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,160
you can check out prs you can now auto

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
merge pr's which is a new feature for

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,640
our cli that was released a few weeks

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,799
ago

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,720
you can easily clone a repo you can

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,600
manage ssh keys and

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,520
so much more cli has been really fun

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,400
even i've been loving using it

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,200
it's available on windows mac os and

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,679
linux

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,720
also fun fact about github cli is it's

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,679
open source

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,120
and you can contribute to it as well so

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,559
speaking of open source

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,080
as i mentioned we're on the open source

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,799
channel so i'm going to give you a few

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,960
top tips

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,720
on getting involved in open source and

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,720
working in open source

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,039
so first one is getting involved in open

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,400
source now if you're seeing that some

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,679
people think well you know how do i get

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,799
involved how do i find

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,640
projects you know one tip that um is one

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,440
of my top tips that was also shared

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,559
yesterday

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,080
during one of our satellite panels is um

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,080
contributing to projects that you might

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,200
already use for example

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,240
i i'm currently using obs to run this

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,720
presentation

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,520
obs is an open source project so if you

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,039
use obs

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,120
that's a really good way you can go in

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,679
and jump in and keep um

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,880
and start contributing to obs you can

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,760
also find really good projects to

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,840
contribute to

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,679
through events like hacktoberfest what

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,679
about all the other times of the year

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,039
or if you're stuck for what you're

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,799
currently using or if you just want

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,960
something completely new

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,200
you can go and check out trending topics

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,960
on github this is a really fun way to

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,679
find out what's currently trending on

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,400
github

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,720
it's also a great way to search by type

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,520
by language type both written and spoken

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,600
language

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,520
so if you go i'm a python developer i

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,280
want to go and search our top projects

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,679
of training on github and python

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,039
and start contributing to that now once

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,160
you've found a project you think you

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,880
might be interested in

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,559
have a look at their reading profile if

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,600
a project is really good or have a good

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,960
reading

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,520
now as the name suggests read this

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,120
does it make sense does it excite you

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,640
does it entice you

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,720
it'll have a really good explanation

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,360
what the project does and how it works

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,039
and if this resonates with you and you

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,400
might think you might want to contribute

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,559
next thing to do is look at the

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,919
contribution guidelines again if it's a

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,360
good project we'll have really good

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,120
contribution guidelines

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,360
that tell you how to contribute to the

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,640
project and how to get involved in

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,640
starting to contribute

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,080
again does it resonate with you does it

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,120
sound like a community you want to be a

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,600
part of

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,440
if so then go and check out their issues

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,039
and have a look at these labels called

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,559
good first issues

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,120
these have been identified by

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,160
maintainers as good ways to get involved

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,880
in github

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,360
and well sorry within the project itself

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
and it's

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,640
identified as an issue that's been

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,000
that's relatively easy to solve

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,520
and will give you a good understanding

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,840
of the project that you're starting to

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,080
contribute to

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,520
so that's pretty much brings us to time

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,039
so if there's more things that you want

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,480

team you know

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,280
both of you know that we use it um as

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,039
part of our devrel team as well so

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,080
yeah i get to use all the cool things on

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,080

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,440
so mish we know that you definitely get

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,000
help

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,880
like a boss but what's the one biggest

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,600
top tip on getting started with github

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,320
um okay getting started especially if

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,440
you're

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,039
like new to github or you've been maybe

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,559
even using github for a while you're

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,880
looking for the next big thing

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,120
is whenever i'm using github or even

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,080
just generally using the internet

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,880
i nearly always come across um github

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,559
repos

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,080
and my biggest tip is just go and style

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,720
them i just start

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,039
everything on github um for example i

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,840
recently got into um cryptocurrency

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,039
mining

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,880
um and i found or like the the tool that

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,520
i used to mine crypto

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,440
again website there scroll down oh cool

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,720
i got some social media channels oh wow

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,200
their repo was all

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,240
posted on github so i immediately went

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,840
to the repo

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,279
starred the repo and i was like oh i'm

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,679
just gonna have a look around at the

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:02,320
ready files and check out the project

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,240
um i found a bug with the um like with

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,159
the software so i opened up an issue

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,520
i even found the fix for it so i like

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,440
put it in the issue

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,440
so i think that's my top tip is like

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,120
when you're browsing and you're surfing

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,120
the internet you find

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,279
really good little pieces of like

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,559
programs or things that you might use

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,240
have a look at where it's actually

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,400
hosted most of the time they're hosting

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,720
on github and i just go and star them

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,440
um so i can go and find them for future

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,279
but also

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,360
like it's just really cool to see that

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,159
all the things that i get to use every

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,080
day i just

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,080
just hosted on github which is awesome

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,080
wow that's that's absolutely you know

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,120
let's just just go and start them and

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,159
then have them

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,000
have them ready out over there so um

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,400
mish you know i know i know you kind of

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
uh interact with a lot of the developers

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,720
and keep talking to them

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
uh was there was there one tip that you

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,400
know you felt that

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,679
oh my god you know even the power users

00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,039
are not aware of this

00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,799
is is there something like that there is

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,679
one and it came out recently

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,520
um in a top tip video that i did um but

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,360
i decided to do the top tip video

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,039
because i showed it live on stream so if

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,440
you do ever come into my streams you get

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,200
some

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,120
really cool insights on what the top tip

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,159
videos are gonna be but i showed this

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,799
thing on stream

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,559
and it was really um good timing so most

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,240
of you know if you've been um

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,080
surfing around social media you would

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,960
have seen the github skyline stuff that

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,880
we announced

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,679
which is a way for you to go in and get

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,240
a 3d version or 3d image

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,760
of your contribution graph and i was

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,600
like this is really cool i can like

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,960
download a 3d image and stuff and then

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,000
someone mentioned to me like

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,440
you know that you can view and host 3d

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,600
files on github so

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,880
i've been like printed out lines this is

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,840
my 2020

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,360
um one here now i was like this on

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,279
stream i was like we did this and i was

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,919
like oh but if you want to see it and

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,799
put it on github you can store the 3d

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,440
file for this

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,799
on a github and so i put the file on and

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,200
you can spin it and

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,799
turn it and use it and play with it on

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,320
github i was like that's really cool and

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,799
my whole audience was just sitting there

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,520
like

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,440
this is really awesome and i was like it

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:11,279
gets better guys check this out

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,279
so i put my 2019 that was my 2020 graph

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,840
i put it against my 2019 graph

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,799
i put it on github and you can actually

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,039
see the difference

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,159
on github so if you're using code review

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,640
and things like that

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,080
you know that the additions are in green

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,320
and deletions are in red

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,480
so if you have a 3d file on github and

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,559
you add a new version of the file

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,880
you can see the changes that are made to

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:37,360
that file in 3d and it was like

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,200
it was like it was just so cool i think

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,200
that's like one of the biggest things

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,360
that even power users don't necessarily

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,039
know and i think it's because like we

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,799
were so ahead of the times when we

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,760
released that feature so that feature

00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,799
was released

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,720
back in 2013 and at the time not many

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,400
people are getting into 3d printing and

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,320
tinkering and stuff like that

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,919
and and now it's just become so much

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,799
bigger so i think we'll see

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,440
a lot more people start to use um github

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,760
for their

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,039
3d version control which i'm really

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,840
excited to see more of that
