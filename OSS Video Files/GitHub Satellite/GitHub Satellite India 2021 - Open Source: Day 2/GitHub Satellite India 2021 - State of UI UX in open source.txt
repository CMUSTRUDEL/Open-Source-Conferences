Title: GitHub Satellite India 2021 - State of UI UX in open source
Publication date: 2021-03-28
Playlist: GitHub Satellite India 2021 - Open Source: Day 2
Description: 
	Presented by Pranav Raj, Co-Founder @ Chatwoot

Open source projects generally do not care about UI/UX patterns, and it is rare to find any discussion or contribution about design. One reason for why this might be the case is that the projects do not have a framework to accept design changes. In this talk, Pranav Raj will cover how to adopt a design language and create an environment for designers and UI developers to contribute. He'll also showcase successful companies who have made UI/UX a priorityâ€”and offer tips for how to promote design discussions and contributions for your own projects.
