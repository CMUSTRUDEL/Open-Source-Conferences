Title: GitHub Satellite India 2021 - State of UI UX in open source
Publication date: 2021-03-28
Playlist: GitHub Satellite India 2021 - Open Source: Day 2
Description: 
	Presented by Pranav Raj, Co-Founder @ Chatwoot

Open source projects generally do not care about UI/UX patterns, and it is rare to find any discussion or contribution about design. One reason for why this might be the case is that the projects do not have a framework to accept design changes. In this talk, Pranav Raj will cover how to adopt a design language and create an environment for designers and UI developers to contribute. He'll also showcase successful companies who have made UI/UX a priorityâ€”and offer tips for how to promote design discussions and contributions for your own projects.

hi everyone

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,240
my name is pranav i'm the ceo of

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,240
chatfoot

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,759
today i'm going to talk about the state

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,279
of uiux in

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:19,840
open source projects how you can drive

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,039
design discussions and how you can

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,560
actually promote

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,119
a design first culture but before going

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,279
into that

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,560
let me introduce myself as i mentioned

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,519
like you know i'm working on an open

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,160
source project

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,640
uh called chatwood i've been

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,600
contributing to open source for about

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,960
seven years now i started in 2014 uh

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,600
through github like you know

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,640
sales years was my first contribution uh

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,480
from there

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,120
it's been an amazing journey from an

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,480
open source contributor to now to a

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,120
open source uh maintainer uh

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,920
so yeah and a little bit about chatwood

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,760
uh

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,600
we are building an open source customer

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,239
engagement suite

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,199
built as an alternative to intercom and

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,239
zendesk

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,280
we started in 2016 we started out as a

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,159
proprietary software but it didn't work

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,439
out well so

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,640
after seeing the data privacy

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,720
regulations uh people moving on to

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,080
you know self-hosted alternatives we

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,799
thought why don't we give us

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,759
this a try and we oppose the project and

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,000
to our surprise it

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,600
got trending in hacker news and from

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,159
there like you know we have been

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,119
working for more than a year uh to build

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,560
features

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,400
and right now like you know we're

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,560
building business out of it

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,840
uh so go check out uh chat food on

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,720
github and

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,240
uh let us know uh your feedbacks we are

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,040
open to contributions

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,200
we're open to discussions yeah feel free

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,560
to do it

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,399
uh so before we jump into the uh actual

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,360
topic let me

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,759
discuss about the two different aspects

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,600
like

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,799
developer experience and product

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,759
experience

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,600
uh so as an open source projects it's

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,360
it's really important for

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,719
you to uh you know concentrate on

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,439
the developer experience because like

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,840
you know uh it really matters

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,080
uh how like you know how it is easy to

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,000
install the software or how hard

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,200
uh is it to maintain or maybe like you

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,120
know when there is a

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,200
new version of the software how hard is

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,680
it to upgrade these all

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,920
things actually matters uh in your

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,480
adoption so if you want to have

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,120
better uh adoption uh you would have to

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,879
make all these things simpler

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,400
uh but like you know there is other

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,200
aspect as well like you know the product

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,440
experience

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,640
uh so uh like you know how you use the

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,879
product how

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,920
where it actually solves the problem so

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,760
today i'm

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,440
i'm going to talk about products

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,480
experience not about the developer

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,360
experience

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,800
uh so yeah i think like you know a

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,680
design in open source projects is

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,360
actually

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,440
pretty debated topic because like you

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,920
know most of the

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,640
uh projects don't follow as standards or

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,319
most of them

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,319
actually uh you know don't have

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,360
a guideline on how to contribute on

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,440
design

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,879
uh so like you know the the one of the

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,800
reasons which we see

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,239
uh for that is because like you know

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,760
design and development are two

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,640
independent processes um for

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,200
designing a better user experience there

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,280
needs

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,040
a group of people with different set of

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,519
skills working together

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,640
uh towards a single goal uh i mean like

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,879
you know their needs

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,640
there needs to be uh you need to have

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,799
like you know designers you need to have

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,480
developers who can implement the design

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,080
and they need to have like communicate

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,920
between these like this should be a

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,519
proper communication between these two

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,760
and this is not happening in

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,799
the open source projects so one of the

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,959
things which

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,560
i've understood from my experience

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,000
working with designers in my previous

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,400
jobs is that like you know most of them

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,239
are problem solvers so they try to

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,760
identify what exactly is the problem

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,400
they try to understand

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,040
how uh this problem is affecting the end

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,280
customers

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,200
and then from there like you know they

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,400
work backwards to identify what's the

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,959
right solution

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,400
and build a user experience around that

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,319
this is not happening

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,000
uh anywhere in like you know any of the

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,760
open source projects because one of the

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,560
problem with that is like you know most

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,319
of the

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,840
uh designers who's new to the open

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,720
source project might not have context

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,720
about

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,840
what people are asking so they need to

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,280
set it up

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,120
they need to like you know understand

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,240
the product better it

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,680
it takes a little bit of time uh to for

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,639
them to actually do that

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,680
and uh second thing is actually like you

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,800
know

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,919
uh the i mean like you know most of the

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,759
open source products as we know

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,280
like you know starts with one single

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,560
developer who

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,800
uh who had a problem so they like uh

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,600
they wanted to like you know put them

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,000
thought and then

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,400
build a small hack or like you know a

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,040
small product which solves their problem

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,520
and then like uh they think like okay

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,840
this

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,440
is useful to me so why can't i open

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,800
source it so they open source the

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,840
product and afterwards like you know

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,240
people

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,360
uh like people see the product and then

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,199
from there like you know they start

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,120
adding more and more features to cater

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:09,919
large set of uh uses uh so

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,960
one of the typical problems uh which

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,199
comes to

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,840
the projects is that like you know since

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,880
it's not built for a larger audience

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,919
uh i mean like they tend to have

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,759
uh like you know ux that incurred

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,440
due to various reasons one is actually

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,280
like you know most people

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,039
who would ask you like you know why

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,039
don't you do x

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,120
to do y or like you know why don't you

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,600
add an option to do something

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,360
so as a as a maintainer you want an

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,000
option as a maintainer you want more

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,919
people

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,280
to be using your product so the

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,160
immediate thought or like you know the

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,919
immediate

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,960
uh uh uh understanding for you would be

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,919
uh to create uh an option for them like

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,120
you know so that like you know they can

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,240
use the product

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,440
and this keeps on adding like

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,039
there will be like you know a lot of

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,080
features that will be like like you know

00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,600
there'll be a lot of

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,400
options which you provide so i like you

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,560
know it it gathers every set of people

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,000
and the end result for that would be

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,680
something like this like you know

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
you you would have a smaller system

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,280
with a lot of function options with a

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,280
lot of controls

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,400
which might not be relevant to most of

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,600
the uses

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,039
so one one one problem with this is

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,919
actually like you know most people would

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,880
have

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,520
uh uh don't won't understand like you

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,000
know

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,720
why these many options are provided or

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,919
like you know

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,120
why this uh like this elaborate set of

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,360
like in options this

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,280
is given in the in the product so it

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,600
it's kind of a learning curve for them

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,280
like you know it's it's not a good ux so

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,880
if if you're not doing something complex

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,039
if you're not doing something

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,000
uh like you know like the one which we

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,080
see in this

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,960
image uh so like try to minimize that

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,360
and like you know

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,120
it's really important to understand that

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,280
you don't have to provide

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,960
every option which every customer or

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,479
like you know every developer is asking

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,840
you on github

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,479
you can always say that like why don't

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,240
you just swap the project and then make

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,919
make option by yourself so that you can

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,919
use it so it doesn't make

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,520
sense for you to add every set of

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,360
features every set of

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,880
options which people are requesting so

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,880
every time you

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,240
uh you get a request that like you know

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,520
add a functionality

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,440
add uh an option to uh to do this

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,000
just think about whether this is going

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,479
to create a ux debt or whether it's

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,319
going to create more and more problem

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:37,280
on on on our end then

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,120
like then after that like you know if

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,720
you think this is going to be a problem

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,280
this is not going to be a

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,520
useful feature for a lot of people who

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,759
are using your product then

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,440
um don't do it like the code like this

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,680
and you can do it yourself

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,639
so this happens to me all the time in

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,319
chat wood

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,160
because most people like you know we

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,680
have a broader product like with a lot

00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,560
of options a lot of customizations

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,800
available

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,479
uh so people would come to say that i

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,360
come and say that you know i want this

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,800
kind of thing

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,919
for this use case and yeah like as a

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,319
developer

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,919
uh the maintainer of the project i my

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,919
immediate reaction is like oh yeah i

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,080
think i can provide that but

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,039
uh most of the time like you know i take

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,120
a step back like

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,360
talk to uh the people who are working on

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,120
the project like understand whether

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,360
this is something that's relevant for

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,080
the larger uh set of people

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,919
uh then if it's not then we would defer

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,520
that or maybe ask the person to actually

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,800
you know build it themselves

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,719
because it's open source right like you

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,000
know you cannot build it themselves

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,839
because it's open source right like you

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,800
know you can uh you can build it out

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,919
yourself you can

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,039
uh like you can change the code which is

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,200
uh which is one of those things which

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:48,399
you would want to do

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,680
if it is not possible to uh

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,920
remove that option let's say like you

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,640
know you have uh even though like you

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,760
know

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,560
even if you have like uh two options

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,240
with two uh like two two type of

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,279
different options with two

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,720
uh yes or no answers there you have like

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,640
four possibilities think about like you

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,279
know 20 different options with like you

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,680
know

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,200
uh 20 different like uh yes or no

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,959
questions like and there will be like

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,800
a lot of options there will be a lot of

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,080
combinations which you have to

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,680
provide so most of the times don't

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,160
add the future right away just like you

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,880
know think about whether you can

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,640
ask the person to say that like you know

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,399
whether they can build it themselves

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,560
if it is not possible if you think that

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,760
this is something which is going to be

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,360
useful for a larger set of uses and

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,120
still you would have to provide a

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,800
standard default right

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,560
so if you look at like zoom as an

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,040
example uh so the

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,160
the way we are uh entering a meeting

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,640
it's just one click

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,000
but if you want to customize uh a

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,920
specific thing like the way

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,760
it's being recorded or like you know the

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,760
uh like the video

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,880
quality or like the audio quality it's

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,839
all there

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,760
but it's it all have like it the all

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,519
those options have a standard default

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,440
so that like you know a new user comes

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,399
in or the person who wants to try out

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,600
the product

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,079
has a very simple uh step to do that

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,200
like you know

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,880
install the software just click on uh

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,880
like you know login and then click on

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,279
start a meeting then you have that

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,160
particular uh you know meeting opened

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,680
right so

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,279
you have to pro you have to think like

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,440
that where you

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,360
you have to provide a standard default

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,120
for all the options which you provide

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,440
so that like you know whenever a person

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,440
comes in like it's it's very easy to

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,360
get started with the project and try to

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,160
use the project so we we do this at chat

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,320
road a lot

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,000
uh we have a standard defaults for most

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,279
of the uh cases which we

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,440
recover even though like you know there

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,040
is a customizability option we prefer to

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,320
have a standard default for all

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,440
options which we provide second problem

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,880
here is actually

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,640
this lack of standardization of

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:57,760
design uh so all right

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,200
so the all the design all the open

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,000
source projects like you know if you

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,839
look at them

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,279
it's it's mostly like as i mentioned

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,079
like you know a developer working on it

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,279
and from there like

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,880
building features out of it so uh there

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,200
is a lack of like you know design

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,480
uh design first thinking uh what i mean

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,839
by that is

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,320
uh like if you look at uh any of the

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,040
uh like web projects out there it's like

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,560
you know there will be

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,320
10 different types of buttons you can

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,079
see or 10 different spacing you can see

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,279
or maybe like you know you can even see

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,720
people writing uh styles in line so

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,560
one of the problems with that is like

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,440
you know as a designer if somebody comes

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,959
to your project

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,320
and even like there are different

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,079
barriers for them to actually like you

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,320
know try and use the product

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,839
even then like you know if they did all

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,079
those the first thing which they are

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,600
going to see is like you know the the

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,839
design itself is like

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,720
not standardized or maybe like you know

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,079
don't have

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,399
a guideline which is written anywhere so

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,000
their first uh thought process would be

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,320
like you know why don't i contribute to

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,800
this

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,519
why don't i contribute to uh the base

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,800
design like

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,320
make it better but often it ends up like

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,959
you know changing a lot of variables

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,279
which

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,560
uh might not be the right thing for uh

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,279
the developer because like and it's a

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,160
lot of for

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,839
work for them to uh change all this and

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,519
like make it standardize and they would

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,680
end up like you know rejecting

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,440
uh the proposal which which might be

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,040
like frustrating for the designer so

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,600
uh before you start like you know think

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,480
about how you can uh standardize

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,519
the the uh like you know the options

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,079
which you take like you know one of the

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,120
easiest

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,120
examples is to take uh uh one of the

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,880
frameworks like you know tailwind or a

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,480
bootstrap or foundation like you know

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,519
take that as an example

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,040
take that as a base uh style guide for

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,079
you and then from there

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,639
build on top of that make the uh

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,519
colors uh with with respect to your

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,639
brand make

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,760
make uh spacing with based on based on

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,720
what you require

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,240
and use the standard colors or spacing

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,120
or like you know whatever is whatever

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,200
you are using

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,880
inside your project like you know make

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,720
it a standard put it somewhere

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:05,360
in a common place so that everyone who

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,560
like who is interacting with the product

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,680
knows that like you know this is the

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,920
place i can go

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,720
and look at uh what is the standard

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,680
being set

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,360
so uh this is what is called like you

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,360
know design force culture like you know

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,639
whenever a new person comes in or like

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,720
you know whenever a new

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,079
uh a new kind of like designer who wants

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,800
to install

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,000
or like you know use the software it is

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,160
easier for them to

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,360
see what's already there like you know

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,079
it's it makes it

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,959
less complex for them to understand what

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,079
are the standards

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:38,959
that that are being set so

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:41,120
we when we started chat root uh we were

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:44,480
thinking about like you know how we can

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,560
uh how we can like adopt this system

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,399
like you know how we can

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,560
adopt a design system or maybe like you

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,959
know adopted a sign language so that

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,160
it's easier for us to communicate with

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,240
uh other people

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,160
so we started searching for the options

00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,600
it was in 2016 design system was a

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,360
smaller thing

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,519
but like there was a good guide written

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,279
by marvel at that point

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,519
so we started from there like you know

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,160
we took their uh design system as an

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,160
example

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,440
and from there we built our own

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,360
standards like you know we have our own

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,079
typography we have our own phones we

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,079
have

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,680
our own spacing or like you know even

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,360
colors like can we customize all those

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,000
things but like the base

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,399
idea or like the base layout was taken

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,760
from

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:28,079
other examples so you right now they

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,600
all of the uh companies are like all of

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,680
the products which is out there

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,800
who have who have certain set of

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,959
guidelines

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,639
would follow some kind of design system

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,639
and to be honest like you know

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,079
i wouldn't i wouldn't recommend anyone

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,120
to just like follow bootstrap because

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,920
like you know

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,120
it gets worse when like you have a lot

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,440
of components

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,399
and there is no way to actually like you

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,160
know um

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,600
make a standard or like there is no way

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,440
to for you to

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,880
uh build a standard just by bootstrap so

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,560
it's more about like you know the

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,720
the culture which you building like you

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,079
know think about standards think about

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,040
like you know our design system how you

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,399
can adopt it like

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:09,839
go check out like different options um

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:12,320
like primer or primer is actually like

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,079
you know the design system for github um

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,000
and you can actually go to refactoring

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,199
ui which is a great book which

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,320
you should follow uh uh which

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,760
like you know even if you are a

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,360
developer or if you even if you are

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,880
someone who don't have who have not

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,959
worked much in design

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,480
that would actually help you uh to

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,639
understand like you know

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,959
like it would help you to get started

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,000
and understand how things work

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,680
uh so and second and and like and

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,880
one of the options which you can do is

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,759
actually like you know document the

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,079
design choices

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,519
what colors you choose what's uh what

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,800
are the components which is available in

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,959
your projects like you know

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,399
how what are the different type of

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,480
options available

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,600
so that whenever you whenever a new

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,800
person comes in

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,240
you can define a process on how they can

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,519
contribute to the project right like you

00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,959
know you already have

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,120
all these things documented and we

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,279
started this with

00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,440
styleguide.chatfoot.com

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,480
so we started our experiments with that

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,240
and right now like you know we are

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,120
writing a guide so that

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,199
our new person who's interested in

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,720
design can like you know look at how

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,160
we are dealing with the design and then

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,759
from there like you know they can

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,440
contribute or maybe

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:22,720
uh just take inspiration from

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,680
so and the third problem which most of

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,560
the people face

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,040
who are designer is they don't know how

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,759
like

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,120
how they can contribute where they can

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,199
where they can contribute

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,639
and what they can contribute so

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,440
the first thing is actually like you

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,600
know where they can contribute

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,000
there is definitely a lack of

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,160
understanding or awareness about tooling

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,680
so github as you say like you know or

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,040
even open source projects

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,600
is mostly about code uh

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,440
the the the amount of people like you

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,199
know the amount of people involving in

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,320
open source projects who are designers

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,480
is very less

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,480
so and there is a separate movement

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,679
called open source design

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,880
and stuff like that but uh the the core

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,720
or like you know the most of the people

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,839
who are working in open source would

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,199
uh who are not designers and for

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,160
designers like you know it's

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,079
it's a big barrier for them to uh

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,360
understand how github works or like you

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,520
know or any other

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,640
a git or svn or any other tools which

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,520
you use

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,120
uh that's first thing and there is no

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,400
there's no like a way around it like no

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,080
they have to learn it

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,600
second is actually like you know even

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,200
even if they come to

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,039
they understand github and they come to

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,760
your project

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,160
they don't know what to contribute right

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,520
like

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,840
there will be a set of issues which

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,799
might be highly technical which is not

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,919
really

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,440
uh really good to understand so you have

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,000
to define

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,440
an issue which describes what is the

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,280
expectation here

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,120
what are the kind of things which you

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,840
would want to build and like you know

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,919
what can

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,600
we contribute or like what can external

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,480
people contribute to that particular

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,000
issue

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,200
most of the times like if you go to any

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,720
of the open source projects it'll be

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,280
like you know there'll be a log

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,760
and then okay this is not working for me

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,000
and this is why this is happening so

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,520
easy there is no easy way to filter out

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,120
these kind of issues

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,919
just to make sure that like you know i

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,160
have a design problem which

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,840
like you know you can solve there is no

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,559
there's no easy way to do that

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,720
so like one of the things which you want

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,360
to do is like you know define

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,640
a process on how you can contribute to

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,960
design

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,320
so first thing is to write down the

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,520
expectations

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,840
have a proper uh product spec so let's

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,760
say

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,120
you're building a teams feature write

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,919
down a product spec

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,440
understand what uh what this feature

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,600
means to you

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,280
then create different types of options

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,000
which is available like or

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,919
different use cases which you can solve

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,240
and from there

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,080
label the issues right like you know if

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,080
you have the product spec complete next

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,360
you want is a high level design

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,679
maybe people can contribute like you

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,679
know it can be uh it can be about civic

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,960
mockup or it can be a figma design it

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,360
can be anything like you know

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,640
just to contribute to the design label

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,799
the issues correctly

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,679
so that people can find it so first

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,520
thing you

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,679
you want to do is like you know label

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,960
them properly with design wanted or

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,559
something of that sort

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,320
and third is actually like you know have

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,360
a clear honor of the issue

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,320
and define how you how you resolve

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,320
conflicts

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,440
so most most often like you know if

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,360
there are two people

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,200
who are working who saw the issue who

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,440
wanted to contribute something then they

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,200
comes with two different approaches

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,760
there is a conflict and you have to

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,480
define very clearly upfront that like

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,080
you know

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,000
this is the person who is owning this

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,520
issue or like this is how this

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,039
issue would be resolved if there are a

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,200
conflicting opinion

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,840
and from there uh you have to define

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,720
that process as well like you know the

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,640
understand like tell

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,120
like write down in that particular issue

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,520
that like you know this is how we accept

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,280
contributions to this particular issue

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,440
uh say you want to have

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,480
these these many things and it should

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,400
not uh

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,919
follow these many things and it should

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,640
follow your

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,320
actual design contributions so like you

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,440
know having that clear ownership and

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,640
having that

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,280
conflict or solution written inside

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,880
uh issues is clearly important and i

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,760
think like i can give an example of

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,559
metabase

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,919
uh so they uh if you if you look at

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,039
their like contribution guidelines there

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,640
is an option called

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,640
there is a section where they define

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,799
design the feature uh

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,080
and in this like even though it's it's

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,919
clearly it might

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,520
it might be like you know their internal

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,400
team working on it like you know it's

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,559
very clear that

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,159
these set of issues which are tagged

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,360
with design needed

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,880
is specifically for designs it's the ux

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,400
is complete or like the

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,320
uh the feature is actually uh understood

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,880
like a feature is already written

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,640
very clearly you have to understand how

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,200
uh like there is a clear description of

00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,200
how

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,640
the functionality would work and the

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,159
next thing you want to do is like you

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,880
know create a design for that

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,840
so people can just go there filter out

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,919
the label

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,840
uh design needed then from there like

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,039
you know they can contribute or maybe

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,679
like you know they can

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,640
provide suggestions which is not there

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,760
in most of the

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,200
problem most of the projects and the

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,080
other way you can approach this is

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,360
actually

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,960
by you know having a process for design

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,799
let's say like you know you have

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,960
a set of components which is desired

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,120
which is designed and you have

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,000
a style guide written for it so you can

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,520
either say

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,440
uh if if the contribution

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,880
if like you know if if you want to do

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,720
something new in design

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,080
just go to the content like you know the

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,760
style guide library

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,600
see if the component is all already

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,559
there if it is there then you can

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,039
actually see

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,840
whether uh you need to make any changes

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,480
or if

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,000
if if it is already like you know it

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,440
already covers everything then you can

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,919
just right away use that

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,880
if it's not present if the component is

00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,880
not present

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,799
then you can propose a new component

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,080
design and if the component like you

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,919
know you can have

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,600
you can define all the steps like that

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,320
so that like you know there is a

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,480
written rule or like you know there is a

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,440
process which is defined on how you

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,600
accept

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,960
design related contributions which makes

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,240
it easier for people to

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,240
contribute as well right like you know

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,600
you go to a project you understand this

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,240
is how you can contribute and then you

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,360
can

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,919
jump right in and then contribute so

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,559
uh primer like as i mentioned github's

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,640
uh

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,480
uh style guide is actually like you know

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,360
they have well written document on

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,799
contributing

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,960
and maybe like you know you can actually

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:40,480
explore other of those projects or

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,799
other uh companies guidelines which

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,240
gives you much better decisions and the

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,720
last part of it is actually like you

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,280
know

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,240
we covered why this is happening how

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,159
this is happening

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,360
and what are the different things which

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,360
you can do to

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,640
improve design contributions now i'd

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,760
like to talk about

00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,880
uh how to drive design discussions uh

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,880
driving design discussions is uh

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,520
double-edged sword uh to be honest like

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,159
you know you you either get a lot of

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,720
good responses or you either get a lot

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,720
of very bad responses and there is no

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,720
uh way to like you know get around on

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,080
that so you have to

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,919
understand like you know whenever you

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,159
start design discussions it can get

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,159
very

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,120
over some kind of very minor colors or

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,000
like you know some spacing

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,960
but it like there is actually a way to

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,440
uh

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,720
way to provide design discussion first

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,200
of all the thing is actually like you

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,600
know

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,240
whenever you write a feature with the

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,400
mock-ups

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,360
right inside the issue just take a

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,799
screenshot

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,480
put that in the issue so that like you

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,840
know when people come to your

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,559
your github go to issues click on one of

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,559
the feature

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,159
description like you know they see how

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,559
this is going to be

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,720
uh in like you know whenever when the

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,640
com feature is completed right like

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,240
at that point they might have some

00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,840
options so this is one of the things

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,279
which we did from very early on

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,679
so that like you know whenever we have a

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,840
design whenever we have a new feature

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,159
which is going to be build we build the

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,679
designs or build the modes in

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,360
in figma from there like you take a

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,760
screenshot and put that on the github

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,960
issue

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,840
and this drove a lot of uh

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,880
comments and like in a lot of

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,240
discussions based on very particular

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,400
things for for example

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,600
very particular on this one was like you

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,440
know one of the things we

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,120
which people suggested was to provide an

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,799
option for them uh

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,640
instead of like you know instead of like

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:34,000
having a

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,679
text area to add this consent uh they

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,360
want to have a standardized concept

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,200
like you know maybe just they can just

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,279
change the variables or like their

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,039
company name they can just use the user

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,080
right away second thing people wanted

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,080
was to add

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,440
options for terms and conditions or like

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,400
you know privacy policy which makes

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,960
sense because

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,480
at all like you know we are we are

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,799
saying like you know you are accepting

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,720
this

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,200
and then you want to have all the links

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,960
together and then

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,320
that kind of things like you know drove

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,080
discussions in us so

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,919
maybe you can experiment with like you

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,880
don't have to have a

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,600
design like this you can just use uh

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,640
balsamiq

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:14,240
or maybe anything like or even like

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:17,440
paper written mocks which which can

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,400
actually drive discussion so driving

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,600
design discussions

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,520
might not really involve uh designers

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,799
it involves people who are actually

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,240
using the product so

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,799
if you are building something out there

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,159
you want to have a better understanding

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,159
how people think about the

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,520
feature you don't have to do user

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,799
research in github because like you know

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,919
your project is open source you can

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,880
leverage that

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,200
as your starting point create a feature

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,960
uh

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,240
if you request and then from there like

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,159
you know put the design

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,640
ask for contributions and there just

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,159
explain very clearly what you're looking

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,720
for and what kind of feedback you're

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,320
looking for

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,000
instead of like if you put something

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,440
like this without that that direction

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,559
what happens is like you know people say

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,039
that okay this

00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,919
uh text or font size is very small or

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,200
maybe like you know

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,360
i want to have the heading bet larger

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,720
instead of that give them clear

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,240
direction on like you know what you're

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,720
looking for as a feedback

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,559
and if there is someone who was willing

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,480
would provide that feedback

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,600
so yeah i think like you know that's all

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,919
that's all i had for

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,760
today so basically like you know i

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,919
define a process

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,200
understand that you need to standardize

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,799
at some point so

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,559
why don't you start at the beginning

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,440
itself like you know standardize

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,840
your components standardize your uh your

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,159
uh

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,679
design system so that like you know

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,600
people can just look at

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,600
uh the designs and understand okay this

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,760
is what this guy is actually doing

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,520
from there if you have like standardized

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,720
design if you have like a process which

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,400
is involved in

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,360
uh design contributions you can actually

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,159
have

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,720
a third thing where like you uh you just

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,120
like

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,480
ask for general public for feedback on

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,919
specific options which would

00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,720
drive more and more design discussions

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,760
so yeah i think that's all we had uh for

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,520
today so i

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,279
i was doing this experimenting this for

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,080
a long time in chat would some of

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,720
it works some of it doesn't work uh but

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,400
yeah

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,720
i'm really happy to talk to you if you

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,880
want to like you know understand how

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,400
uh i see about this maybe like you know

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,120
you can reach out to me on

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,880
twitter or or my email as i shared

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,120
before

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,240
then yeah i think like you know that's

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,360
that's pretty much it

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,600
thanks for taking time to watch this

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,600
talk

00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,640
