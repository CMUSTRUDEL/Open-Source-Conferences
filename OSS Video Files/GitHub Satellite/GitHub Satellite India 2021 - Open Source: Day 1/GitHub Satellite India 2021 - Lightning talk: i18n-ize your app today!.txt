Title: GitHub Satellite India 2021 - Lightning talk: i18n-ize your app today!
Publication date: 2021-03-28
Playlist: GitHub Satellite India 2021 - Open Source: Day 1
Description: 
	Presented by Amruth Pillai, Software Engineer, Postman

When Amruth Pillai was building his open source project, Reactive Resume, he came to realise that the language in which your users interface with your application can play an important role. Translating your app to the user's native language can encourage them to spend more time on the appâ€”and convert potential users into customers.

In this talk, Amruth will discuss his learnings from developing Reactive Resume, and the impact of having it translated into 22 languages (and counting) with the help of the community. He'll also talk about the tools that helped him simplify the process of internationalisation and localisation, while highlighting the benefits that a multi-language UI has provided to both the project and its users.

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,119
international lies

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,320
it is it's difficult so uh thank you for

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,840
that great introduction

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,439
um i am amrit pillai and uh to be honest

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,080
i really don't have much to say about

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,199
myself

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,920
except that i got insanely lucky when

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,200
building a personal project of mine uh a

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,239
simple resume builder

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,399
called reactive resume this talk

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,320
is just going to be about decoding how i

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,320
got lucky and hoping that this

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,120
journey of mine would help you in your

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,039
product development as well

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,520
i only have one simple idea to share

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,559
with you today and that's

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,840
internationalization i could end this

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,480
talk right here right now

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,960
for those who already know what that is

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,800
but

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,000
do stick around i think you might enjoy

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,680
this

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,560
i'm going to talk about how i

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,159
implemented i-89 in my project

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,240
how it helped me in increasing

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,280
collaboration amongst other open source

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,520
devs and

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,720
also how it helped me reach my project

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,280
goals much faster than i ever expected

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,400
finally i'll also be talking about how

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,840
you can adopt i18n into your apps today

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,400
and also some tools to help you in the

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,960
process

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,200
cool so let's head on over to the link

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,240
on the screen

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,640
this is rx residue.me and i'm

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,320
going to be logging in right now into

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,079
the app

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,360
on this screen you can create multiple

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,840
resumes uh

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,280
depending on your job profile clicking

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,479
on your resume you are taken to the

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,960
resume builder

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:54,640
and while you're on the screen you can

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:57,360
edit stuff like your name

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,240
and you can see watch it instantly uh

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,439
change

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,079
uh in the preview on the left side you

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,240
can

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,000
edit a bunch of sections and on the

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,280
right you can

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,120
change layouts organize

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,879
your layout you can switch between

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,840
templates organize layouts

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,319
uh you can change colors even uh for

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,840
fonts

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,239
or a lot of other things uh you can even

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,800
export your resume as a pdf

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,319
or you can share a url with anyone who

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,280
would want the latest copy of your

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,000
resume

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,800
but all that's great the crux of today's

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,560
conversation

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,800
is right here languages reactive resume

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,640
is currently available in 26 different

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,120
languages and counting

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,319
i can simply switch to a language like

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,160
let's say german

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,599
and it would change the interface

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,519
completely and

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,599
also certain tokens used within the

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,319
resume

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,040
well now that you've seen the app a

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,480
question that

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,280
you might have popped into your mind

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,280
would have been you know what was your

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,280
what motivated you to add multiple

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,280
language support in the first place

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,040
or on the other hand if your brain have

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,239
has that question

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:12,000
here's the answer to it anyway uh

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:14,879
well it was purely accidental

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,519
i added support for i18n to just allow

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,920
the people

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,760
around me to be able to use it in

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,080
languages like kannada and tamil for

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,959
which

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,440
i could translate on my own with the

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,080
help

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,280
of my friends it was used by a few

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,360
people here locally

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,440
but once it got a bit of traction on

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,120
sites like reddit or hacker news

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,879
that's when a lot of users as well

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,440
chimed in and added translations for

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,519
their own languages

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,840
all that's great but what was it good

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,680
for having added all these languages or

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,519
even more having to develop the

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,080
architecture to be able to translate the

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,519
app

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,879
because it wasn't easy for one

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,040
increased collaboration i never expected

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,400
that i'd be working alongside so many

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,480
amazing developers

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,319
and translators who contributed to

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,959
reactive resume

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,000
this increased the overall participation

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,720
for this project

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,519
on github and was a contributing factor

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,599
to why

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,680
this particular repository received so

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,360
much traffic

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,680
secondly positive conversions now

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,519
if this project had some kind of premium

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,359
model i could tell you how this helped

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,240
me in making a lot of money

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,560
but sadly it had none of these things

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,120
since reactive resume is a non-profit

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,240
project

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,320
i only measured conversions by analyzing

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,600
how many people are talking about the

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,199
project and thus

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,600
spreading the word to those who need it

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,240
the most for this i often head to

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,479
twitter

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,520
to see what people are saying and it's

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,680
been good things so far

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,560
some other key takeaways from this

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,440
journey were

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,919
finding out more about my domain because

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,800
now

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,280
i had to cater to a larger audience one

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,520
specific example to this

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,639
is that when i started having people

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,720
translate the app

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,680
to european languages like german or

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,120
french

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,800
people from these regions were

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,039
requesting for a special type of

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,560
template called europass which is widely

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,919
used there

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,880
this is something i would have never

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,880
known about if it weren't for them

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,120
it also helped me in increasing

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,440
accessibility in the product overall

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,120
i was inclined to use icons in place of

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,120
text more often than not

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,479
so that translators wouldn't have to

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,540
work too hard to

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,000
convert every phrase into their language

00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:31,120
[Music]

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,400
this also made it us possible for users

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,199
of advanced stages

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,199
or non-english speaking natives to

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,000
navigate the user interface without any

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,280
aid

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,560
a small example of this is that

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,880
i've developed many projects before but

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,960
when i showed reactive resume to my dad

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,800
who is a native tamil speaker

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,120
he was able to use it just like how i

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,199
imagined anybody else to be using it

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,240
soon enough he was sharing the link to

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,479
the project with his

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,360
friends and family on various whatsapp

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,319
groups as

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,240
more stats do and this turned into a

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,479
viral marketing campaign that i would

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,840
have

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,080
that would have never even crossed my

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,080
mind

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,440
all right okay taking a quick detour

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,639
from our regularly scheduled programming

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,280
here's a neat gif

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,479
my conscience wouldn't let me be free if

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,919
i hadn't kept at least one

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,639
resume-related gif

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,199
in the presentation so uh that's where

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,000
it is

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,319
uh a quick shout out to the fans of the

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,319
office

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,280
all right so getting back now we have

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,880
briefly gone through the advantages

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,600
of having an architecture where you

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,319
allow translations for your app

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,919
let's talk about how to adopt i18n into

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,000
your app today

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,080
something that can take minimal effort

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,360
is adopting multiple currencies

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,599
for when let's say you have an

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,520
e-commerce platform

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,720
on the other hand if you have an app

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,520
where your users deal

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,599
with dates and records it would go a

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,240
long way to support an option to choose

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,599
multiple

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,360
date time formats on top of this

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,199
implementing an architecture to include

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,919
translations might be time consuming

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,160
but a very fruitful task in the end you

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,840
can make use of libraries like

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,960
iit next to incorporate the architecture

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,759
necessary to

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,400
allow translations into your app there

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,560
are even

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,560
automation tools like iet index scanner

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,160
to help you extract all the strings

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,919
from your app into a single json file

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,000
next you can use a translation

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,680
management platform such as crowdin

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,759
to help you manage your different

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,240
languages and strings

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,840
this aids in non-tech folks as well to

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,240
help you translate your app

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:44,479
without having to clone your github repo

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:47,360
and edit a json file without any context

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,639
a big big shout out to github's student

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,440
developer back here

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,440
if you have access to this it has a lot

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,479
of offers for much more advanced and

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,720
feature rich

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,800
language manager management platforms

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,639
that you can use for your public or

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,039
private repositories

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,720
fun fact i actually found crowding

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,280
through this list myself

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:12,720
and countless of other tools that help

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:14,960
me in building reactive resume

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,199
before moving to the end of this talk

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,759
i'd like to go through a few glossary of

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,680
words

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,000
that you would tend to come across while

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,319
dwelling in the domain of languages

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,319
they all might seem the same but there

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,960
is a very important distinction between

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,120
each of them

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,759
and understanding them would ensure that

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,640
you've covered your bases

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,919
ga11n is the father of all buzzwords

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,159
globalization

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,680
it simply means to make your existing

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,159
product available

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,279
to a global market the methods of making

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,040
a product global

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,480
well that's what's coming next i18n

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,480
is the one that i used to title this

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,920
talk and repeat it numerous times during

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,680
this presentation

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,040
but it isn't everything

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,080
internationalization

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,640
uh means to try to make your product

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,160
cater to an international audience this

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,519
could mean that they speak the same

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,760
language as you but

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,480
have other differences such as currency

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,720
or date time formats

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,560
l10n is something that i haven't picked

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,959
on specifically for this talk

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,920
but an important step nevertheless

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,080
localization

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,680
is all about creating content that

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,320
caters to audience from different

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,839
cultures

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,839
or even different languages for example

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,959
if you were to have a cooking blog you

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,600
wouldn't want to feature

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,440
an article about biryani recipes in a

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,320
location that's known for its sweet

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,000
tooth

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,000
you would want to tailor some specific

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,800
content for people located there

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,519
maybe gulab jamun on a much grander

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,440
scale

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,720
netflix tries to incorporate

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,880
localization by

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,000
actively producing content not just in

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,920
english but in

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,800
other spoken languages such as spanish

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,080
hindi or even tamil

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,720
t9n is all about translation making your

00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,080
user interface available for consumption

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:03,040
in multiple languages that's it

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,880
and finally a11y is something you might

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,920
have heard about in other contexts

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,640
accessibility but equally applicable

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,959
here

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,120
by creating more products that can be

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,360
used in multiple languages

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:19,839
we are creating a much more accessible

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,839
internet for everyone

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,399
coming back to the original idea that i

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,640
wanted to share with you

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,760
if there's just one thing to take away

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,640
from this lightning talk

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,200
it's that if you have an app out there

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,040
today

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,560
or better yet if you're planning to

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,079
build your next project

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,600
please make it accessible through

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,160
multiple language of

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,399
multiple languages your users will thank

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,720
you for it

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,839
