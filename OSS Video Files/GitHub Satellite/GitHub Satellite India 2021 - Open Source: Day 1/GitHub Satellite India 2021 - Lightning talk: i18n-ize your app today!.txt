Title: GitHub Satellite India 2021 - Lightning talk: i18n-ize your app today!
Publication date: 2021-03-28
Playlist: GitHub Satellite India 2021 - Open Source: Day 1
Description: 
	Presented by Amruth Pillai, Software Engineer, Postman

When Amruth Pillai was building his open source project, Reactive Resume, he came to realise that the language in which your users interface with your application can play an important role. Translating your app to the user's native language can encourage them to spend more time on the appâ€”and convert potential users into customers.

In this talk, Amruth will discuss his learnings from developing Reactive Resume, and the impact of having it translated into 22 languages (and counting) with the help of the community. He'll also talk about the tools that helped him simplify the process of internationalisation and localisation, while highlighting the benefits that a multi-language UI has provided to both the project and its users.
