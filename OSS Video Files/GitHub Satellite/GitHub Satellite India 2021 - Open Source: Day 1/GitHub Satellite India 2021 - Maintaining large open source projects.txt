Across the world, developers contribute important work to all kinds of open source projects. While this work doesn't always begin as a passion project for many of them, it often becomes one, especially when they become recognized maintainers. In this panel discussion, Santosh Yadav, a GitHub Star, chats with two such maintainers from Gatsby and Magento to unveil their journey of becoming maintainers, how they collaborate with contributors and peers, and their advice for developers and contributors on their open source journey.

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,880
career

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,080
uh what about you

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,759
it's been great um i think there's been

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,400
two parts to it one

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,039
is the fact that working on now gatsby

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,479
is a pretty huge project right we have

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,160
i i don't remember the numbers of the

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,800
top my head but i think roughly about

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,479
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,280
000 downloads weekly

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,479
now that's a lot of scale and that's a

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,800
lot of users

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,280
and uh on such a large project there's

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,240
always a lot of nuance and complexity

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,160
right and there's

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,520
and there's issues you kind of see that

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,720
that you wouldn't normally hit on a

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,560
day-to-day basis

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,160
um that's been something that's helped

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,360
me level up tremendously

00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,759
as as a dev um and besides that working

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,479
in

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,160
the open working in public uh in open

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,120
source is great because it's really

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,520
helped me

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,560
sort of build a presence and also build

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,199
um

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,240
you know stuff to be able to show off um

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,160
on github

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,039
so i think i think that's been pretty

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,360
solid for my career

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,720
oh that's that's great i i really agree

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,639
with that because i have been

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,400
doing open source from last one and half

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,479
year now more than two years

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,440
and i can see the kind of impact it has

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,479
on my career so

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,080
i agree with both of you uh now

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,680
next let's move on to the next question

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,479
i'm sure there are a lot of new

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,919
developers and

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,839
we have just seen the stats and i'm

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,279
really excited i mean india is one of

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,959
the growing countries

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,560
in terms of open source contribution

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,279
million developers added

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,600
uh in last one year and i'm hoping for

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,640
uh

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,040
next 10 million soon so how

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,480
or what are your suggestions uh to the

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,360
nif developers who wants to start

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,920
contributing to open source

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,519
so shikha you want to take the stage

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,360
first

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:07,200
yeah like for new developers like

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:10,240
i would suggest them to like just go for

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,320
any open source like if they want to uh

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,480
like have a graph like they are just

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,720
graduating and they want to

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,240
join any product development company or

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,640
something like somewhere i have

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,600
read about that like if you have some

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,480
background in

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,760
open source working then there are more

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,240
chances to get in

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,120
uh in a big product development

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,279
companies

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,279
i have read it somewhere so basically

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,519
for that is also very helpful to

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,720
increase their improve their skills and

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,160
also the code

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,320
you write on open source github like

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,360
repositories then that will be exposed

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,600
to everyone

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,279
so you more focus on your work so it

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,480
definitely it is going to

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,200
improve your skills so for like

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,920
basically

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,560
they should just they should not rush

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,640
about

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,000
doing the contribution they should just

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,040
go slightly

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,640
and they just i would suggest them to

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,279
read out all the comments on the

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,279
previous

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,600
pull requests and issues like just

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,839
involving the discussions first

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,519
and then they will learn the patterns

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,640
over working on that

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,519
and also like just not go for the code

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,320
contribution

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,600
also go for the documentations that is

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,399
also very helpful

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,360
uh part for any devs and they will also

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,440
like uh

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,519
realize it very soon whenever they will

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,640
expose to real industries

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,760
so yeah i would suggest them to be uh

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,240
like

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,120
go slowly don't rush and be consistent

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,720
with whatever

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:42,160
they are doing that's all my discussion

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,800
like for this suggestion for this

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,079
great tips uh what about you i'm i have

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,120
seen gatsby actually

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,640
uh gets get a very close with the

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,240
developers or the developer community

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,040
which is out there and uh they have

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,600
helped i think

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,560
many developers to start contributing to

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,160
open source so i would

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,000
i would love to hear from you how you do

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,519
that

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,399
i mean what are the tips you share with

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,600
the new developers

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:10,560
yeah that's a great question so um

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,720
here's what i here's what i think um the

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,560
best way to start contributing is to

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,000
contribute to a project that you use

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,720
frequently um

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,760
if you're using any project in either

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,320
your day-to-day work

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,160
or on a site project and you you know

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,480
you happen to hit a bug

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,360
uh maybe that's a great place to start

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,760
you know try to

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,480
create a small reproduction open an

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,720
issue

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,079
see if you can uh fix the bug yourself

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,440
open a pull request

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,440
um or even if it isn't a bug often we we

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,279
um you know we read documentation

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,680
something is unclear

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,440
you're not sure exactly what you know

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,279
certain api looks like

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,880
maybe a great place to start is to

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,800
improve that documentation

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,480
and uh you know talking about gatsby

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,440
with gatsby uh

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,000
our contributions have been fantastic i

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,959
mean

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,160
gatsby is what it is in a huge part

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,959
because of the community

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,720
we've had over 2 000 if i recall

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,240
correctly contributors

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,880
over time and if you'd like to get

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,279
started

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,240
with gatsby itself we have a ton of open

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,440
issues

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,040
um i'm always happy to help and point

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,399
you in the right direction you can reach

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,440
out to me on twitter

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,200
um we also have a gatsby discord which

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,680
is a great place for people to

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,560
you know just get their feet wet and uh

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,320
get started

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,160
you can you can find a link on on our

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,360
website um

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,079
yeah uh you know and no no contribution

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,639
is too

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,680
small so even if it's a typo even if

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,760
it's something

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,600
you know fairly minor that's still

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,160
valuable so it's always good to start

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,760
from

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,120
from anything really i agree totally

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,880
agreed because i started my

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,480
contribution uh in angular with

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,880
documentation and

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,519
it never mattered how small that pr is

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,200
but

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,200
actually open source community uh

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,839
welcomes or appreciates each and every

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,000
pr

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,600
so uh in case you want to get started

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,720
with open source contribution

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,320
just go ahead and get in touch with

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,440
siddharth and they will get they've been

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,200
helpful

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,959
now let's move on to the next question

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,760
which is more on the terms of

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,920
maintenance

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,440
because there are really uh there if you

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,839
go to open source there are a lot of

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,639
consumers rather than the people who are

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,079
actually

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,079
helping the open source community and

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,600
maintainers are actually one of the

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,480
important part of that entire ecosystem

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,200
i would say

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,040
so what are your suggestions to new uh

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:35,440
maintainers of an open source projects

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:38,639
i mean when they represent the community

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:42,720
so see that we want to go first yeah

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,079
sure sure um i think uh

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,720
firstly that's a great question thank

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:49,519
you for asking that um i think uh

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,079
you know my only advice would be uh be

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,519
kind

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:55,920
be inclusive and have empathy um i think

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,639
a lot of users when they stumble upon

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,040
your project

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,320
might not have as much context as you do

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,560
and uh you know

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,360
something might seem unclear often

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,279
issues

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,720
uh aren't as detailed as you'd like them

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,199
to be but

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,720
um it's always it's always a good idea

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,360
in my opinion to be inclusive

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,959
ask the right questions um and you know

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,320
try to foster that that sort of

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,959
community

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,800
besides that i think um a couple of

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,120
things on github right i think

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,040
issue templates are a great way to help

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,519
point people in the right direction

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,240
um having you know maybe a discord

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,440
channel

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,680
uh to be able to talk to folks who uh

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,000
are trying to contribute is is something

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,160
that has been very helpful for gatsby

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,079
and i can see a lot of maintainers uh

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,160
you know uh being able to take

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,440
sort of uh being able to you know

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,399
benefit from that

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,880
um and finally i think labeling is is a

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,120
is a

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,240
is a really helpful thing to do right

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,800
github has

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,519
a couple of um labels like good first

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,440
issue

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,360
that um show up even if you know you

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,199
search for a project or

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,440
or if you search for good first issues

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,560
so if you if you identify issues in your

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,680
project that you

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,160
think um are you know a good starting

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,480
point

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,600
for new contributors as a maintainer

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,839
labeling them

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,839
uh you know editing their descriptions

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,839
for those to be really clear

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,000
these are things that really help you

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,199
scale you know your project as a

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,839
maintainer and help you

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,320
invite the right kind of contributions

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,000
um

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,240
so that's what i would recommend be

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,160
inclusive and uh

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,800
you know edit your issues write them

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,560
well label them

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,800
that's great tips what about you

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,759
yeah i completely agree with said like

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,680
whatever he

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,839
was suggesting like to have uh issue

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,480
templates and labeling and also

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,199
editing the issue description basically

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,320
uh for

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,720
magento itself like we also like

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,920
there are little templates for issues

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,560
and also

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,759
uh like you can also add the good first

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,000
issues based on

00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,040
if they are contributing for the first

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,199
time

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,839
i would also like to add some things

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:06,240
like if you are a maintainer and you are

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,279
reviewing so like that's the thing like

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,839
there are some

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:12,000
little mistakes like there is just

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,040
changes in one line and one file

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
and you just uh approve it witho

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,399
without checking all the automation test

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,880
is passed so like sometimes it happens

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,000
like

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,320
the the test is not actually passed so

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,079
be uh make sure that you are checking

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,120
all the things before approving the pull

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,519
request

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,720
also i would suggest that like some time

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,199
i've seen that

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,480
like some people some maintainers or

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,880
whatever like

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,199
in some cases like we are adding some

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,720
comments for the contributor and we are

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,880
not available there to

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,800
answer their questions over that is

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,600
coming out of our comments

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,639
so be make sure that you are available

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,959
on time to

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:58,160
uh have uh like answer the contributors

00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:00,079
questions as well and uh being a

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,360
maintainer i would like it's

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,959
not it's like it's not required to

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,039
have the knowledge of each and every

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,919
sections you are checking and

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,199
contributor

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,720
is working so make sure like if there is

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,360
possibility to have

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,839
like you can ask for discussion and

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,880
views

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,720
from other maintainers so just try to

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,720
initiate the discussion for

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,439
that for other maintainers views as well

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,839
so that

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,120
the only the perfect solution should be

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:33,520
delivered to the

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:36,720
main branches and yeah that's all

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,080
for my point of view so the next

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,080
question is really important

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,840
to everyone who is involved in open

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,039
source or even not involved in open

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,200
source right so

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,120
how to stay away from burnout so i'm

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,880
sure it happens to everyone and you may

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,120
have been in the same scenario so

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,200
uh if you can share your stories and how

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,799
you you were able to actually

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,799
uh stay away from burnout how you

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,080
disconnected yourself so i'll be happy

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,559
to actually hear your

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,799
experiences so that's it you want to go

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,799
first

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:10,480
yeah sure so that's a great question um

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:13,280
i mean burnout is is inevitable i think

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,880
to a certain extent um and it happens to

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,200
everybody it's happened to me

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,400
um i'm sure it's happened to you as well

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,960
i think uh

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,160
what's really important is is work-life

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,799
balance right i think we take for

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,280
granted

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,520
that uh especially with the pandemic

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,440
it's easy to get lost in your work and

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,520
spend too much time working and not you

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,840
know taking time out to do things that

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,559
you really enjoy

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,400
even if you really enjoy coding and you

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,640
know you want to do that outside of work

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,520
i still recommend

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,640
trying to take time away from you know

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,440
screens

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,760
go out you know get some fresh air um

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,640
and

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,320
and uh you know find hobbies that uh

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,919
don't have to do with a computer

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,360
i think that sort of balance really

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,760
helps uh one of

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,400
you know the things i do is is i like

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,520
diving

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,520
so i i you know travel whenever i can uh

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,400
in fact i'm i'm doing that right now

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,160
so uh yeah you know try to find some

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,120
solid work life balance

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,919
uh maintain boundaries take time off

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:17,120
regularly for yourself to recuperate

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,960
and uh don't work weekends

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,320
uh that's something that i see a lot of

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,360
people uh

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,080
doing early in their career and i would

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,600
not recommend

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,600
it don't work weekends

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,280
uh so what about yusika what's

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,559
yeah i completely agree with say it

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,840
because like uh

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,840
there is uh like and during this logged

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,559
on period especially there are a lot of

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,760
chances to have stress over the work

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:51,360
and uh like uh what i do like uh

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:54,240
i do to prioritize my work first

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,280
so that like i am not working on uh on

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,120
less important

00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:01,440
uh tasks very much so the prioritization

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,559
is helping me out uh very much

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,039
and apart from this like as the said

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,400
said

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:11,440
like uh taking periodically

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:14,880
time off from your screen time and

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,440
just go involve in some other activities

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,159
that is also helping us like helping

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,000
everyone

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:24,400
a lot to avoid this stress

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,159
and apart from this like if uh if you

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,000
are working on certain tasks and you

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,640
have to achieve some milestone in your

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,520
work so

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,240
if it is required to do extra efforts

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,440
and

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,919
take extra stress and be focused on that

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,840
so

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,480
in that case like i would suggest to

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:44,320
find out the motivation out of your work

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,400
time to uh get note down all the uh

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,360
benefits and learnings you are getting

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,400
through that

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,679
work so in that case like if you are

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,559
working hard and working too much and

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,840
with very stress so in that in that

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,400
situation also you

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,320
find the motivation to work and i really

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,480
feel that if you are really motivated

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,400
and passionate about your work there are

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,640
less chances that you will

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:13,520
get stressed out uh out of your work so

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,559
that's the thing that's the thing to

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,360
avoid your

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,360
stress at your uh professional life

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,679
well that's great so thanks for sharing

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,280
the tips so now next question which i

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,440
have is

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,400
uh everyone has their own motivation

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,559
right so

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,640
whenever they do something so what your

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,840
motivation what drives you towards the

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,200
open source country or

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,360
doing open source contribution or

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,320
maintaining the community

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,320
or helping the community

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:48,720
so uh that's a great question

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,720
oh sorry yeah go for it

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:55,200
the motivation is to uh just um

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,280
for me the motivation is to gather the

00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,880
knowledge and share your knowledge

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,360
like it's a great feeling if you are

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,080
able to help others community

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,159
and be involved in that and you can be

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,600
recognized for your work so

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:12,159
the main motivation for me is to

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,760
like you can have the expert to make

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,799
opinion on your

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,440
uh working and also you can improve your

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,200
skills

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,720
you can be involved in several

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,840
discussion and there

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,960
your uh your like uh

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,679
suggestion might be matter almost maybe

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,440
there are

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,720
some chances like your suggestion will

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,440
be counted as

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,760
one of the best suggestion and that can

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,880
be

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,679
implemented in a way and if even if you

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,840
are working

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,600
in a big organization they are also

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,720
including your thoughts

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:47,440
in their product so it's a great uh

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,600
feeling of achievement for me like if

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,400
you are being recognized for your work

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,400
so knowledge sharing is the most uh

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,360
motivation for me

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,799
for working on open source like i can be

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,240
involved in the discussions

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:05,360
and also i can learn a lot from

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,880
their experiences oh that's it

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,880
so what about using what's what's

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,080
my motivation is that i get paid for it

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,039
uh i'm kidding

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,000
but i think i think i'm half kidding um

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,679
the other thing that

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,280
i mean the thing i like the most about

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,000
open source on serious note

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,400
is that there's the sort of scale in

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,039
open source projects that's hard to find

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,159
in day-to-day product development i mean

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,440
unless you're working on

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,320
a really large project or a really large

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,640
product like

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,240
maybe twitter or facebook it's likely

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,400
that your open source

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,400
project will probably see more users

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,600
than you know the product you're using

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,880
it for maybe

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,600
um and that kind of scale

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,640
brings a really different class of

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,760
problems

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,679
and a really different class of

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,600
complexity um

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,720
i've really been enjoying that at gatsby

00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,760
it's hard

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,080
but it's also uh it's hard to solve you

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,960
know

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,159
difficult problems um i've i've noticed

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,880
that that's driven me

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,760
uh another thing that's driven me has

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,520
just been

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:14,640
uh you know open sources is really

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,000
um it's really satisfying in the fact

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,120
that you know when you see other people

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,840
being able to create

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,320
real value from from your work i think

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,400
it's

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,320
it's a huge multiplier in terms of how

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,720
much of an impact you can have right

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,919
uh versus you know building one product

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,480
or building

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,279
something that's used in you know many

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,159
products

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:36,240
um that's that's really you know been

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,960
driving me at gatsby seeing all the

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,360
fantastic projects people create with it

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,400
so

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,120
um so yeah that's what's uh

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,520
that's what's driven me so far that's

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,360
great

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,039
so let's move on to our last question

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,279
for the day so uh

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:53,039

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,120

where developers can learn more about it

00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,440
