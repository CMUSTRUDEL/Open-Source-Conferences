[Music]

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,639
hi everyone

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,400
my name is leah thomas i co-created hope

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,720
scotch open source project

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,320
hope scotch is an open-sourced api

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,560
development ecosystem

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,359
and in the next 20 minutes i will be

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,199
unveiling

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,400
the inspiration behind starting the

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,640
project

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,400
along with our journey so far some of

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,840
the obstacles that we faced

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,600
and how we manage to solve and scale

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,360
hopes coach to our 170 000 plus users

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,879
from around the globe

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,840
so also the most important thing i will

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,280
be giving out

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,160
five super simple ways on how you can

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,960
monetize your own open source projects

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,480
and at the end i will be discussing the

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,360
future of open source

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,239
developer tools so without further ado

00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,920
let's get started

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:04,960
this happened in 2019 august 21

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,960
i was a fresher just joined in a very

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,200
early step startup just after my

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,479
engineering graduation

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,200
and one of the first tasks that i was

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,640
assigned

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,680
is api integration of a project

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,040
there were like 100 plus api endpoints

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,080
for me to test and bind it to the ui

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,159
so so that was the exact

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,680
day that i realized there is this

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,960
category of tools

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,600
called api testing tools and guess what

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,119
i actually

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,600
went on a hunt to find a simple solution

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,720
that would allow me to test my apis

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,520
without you know making much effort i

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,479
even tried

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,960
downloading one popular app but it ended

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:52,159
up crashing my 10 year old pc

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,799
and realizing all such tools are

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,920
you know uh causing a lot of cpu

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,799
consumption

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,040
i was very frustrated because at the end

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,960
of the day if i don't get my job done

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,159
i'm gonna get fired from my first ever

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,119
tech job

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,479
so at that night itself i decided to

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,599
create a tool

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,160
which operates in my web browser so that

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,480
i can

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,160
i can you know test my apis directly

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,160
from the browser window itself

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,920
without switching back and forth between

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,280
multiple apps

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,480
and within like two to three hours

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,760
i created a very minimal mvp

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,519
which looked something like this

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,480
so you can see exactly how unpolished

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,840
or incomplete the first time vp of hope

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,560
squash looks like

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,360
this is the first ever initial commit

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,040
that i made

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,120
on github for the hopes coach project

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,519
it is pretty simple you just have to

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,000
enter the api endpoint choose a method

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,360
and just

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,120
click send and you will get the response

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,280
beneath it so if there is anything or if

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,640
there was only one thing i want you to

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,440
remember from this session

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,159
it should be this never be ashamed of

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,440
your initial

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:09,519
version and if your first launch

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,440
doesn't look somewhat like this the

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,080
chances are it's probably too late to

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,040
launch

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,800
so ship your product ship your idea as

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,400
soon as possible

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,599
so moving on after making the initial

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,480
commit

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,879
i felt very proud of myself i went i was

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,120
very satisfied with what i have done

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,640
i really wanted to share the news with

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,000
the community

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,080
i made this single web page application

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,400
and hosted on github pages

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,000
thanks for github because github pages

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,360
is the most simplest

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,480
way to host a static website and hope

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,640
scotch being a 100 peso lead static site

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,280
it was it just took me like couple of

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,000
minutes to do that

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,319
after launching the mvp in github pages

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,159
i

00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:01,200
also wrote a blog on my devdot profile

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:04,080
and i i went back to sleep

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,599
the next day when i woke up i actually

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,000
woke up to this hundred plus

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,480
notifications on my smartphone

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,640
most of them were from github there were

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,120
a lot of issues there were a lot of

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,239
future requests lot of comments on the

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,959
project

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,320
i started to realize that within like

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,759
six to eight hours

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,840
i mean in overnight i had 100 plus

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,160
active uses using the first evolution of

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,720
hopscotch

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,680
over the week i tried adding a lot of

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,360
more features

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,720
and fixing a lot of bugs right now

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:42,400
hope scotch is a community of 180

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,520
000 plus users and the ui and the app

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,639
has improved lot more and this

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,720
is the current hopes calculation

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,759
with lot of features from the initial

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,560
version

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,240
you can test your apis within two to

00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,800
five seconds

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:03,600
and the response can be like found here

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,199
apart from testing restful apis you can

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,800
even test graphql

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:11,919
real-time api such as web socket ssc

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,960
you can even generate api documentation

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:19,039
and the whole uh hope scotch testing

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:22,639
ecosystem consists of a cli client

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:25,440
uh two web browser extensions

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,840
a proxy middleware servers and lot of

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,960
lot of other projects as well

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,000
so this is the initial chaining of

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,120
hopscotch

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,759
and right now we are at a good

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,759
good position where the repository has

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,280
more than

00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:47,199
29 000 plus github stars with all 120

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,199
plus contributors from around the world

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,120
so this is the post which kind of went

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,880
viral and

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,919
had almost over 132 000 plus

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,600
page views on devdo 2. this is the

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:05,759
single most traffic

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:08,639
which i got for hospital project

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,840
so what does this mean for an ordinary

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,800
developer like me

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,039
or like you is the all traction hope

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,240
score shot can be reproduced for another

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,360
project

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,120
or how is it possible for a project from

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,560
india to get this much traction

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,440
worldwide so

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,400
these are some of my observations that i

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,560
made from

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,520
building hopscotch project which might

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,479
help you to

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,800
build the next best open source project

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,479
so

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,840
the first thing starts with a

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,400
realization that

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,120
progress takes time it might happen

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,160
overnight

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,280
but the mindset should be progress

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,160
should take at least a uh limited period

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,120
of time

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,560
for the project to get to a mature state

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,759
it might be one week

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:57,039
one month six months or hour and year

00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,160
so the mindset is very important that

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,039
progress is a gradual process and the

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,960
second thing i

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:07,919
i really keen to do is i always

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,039
try to solve a single problem faced by

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,160
myself

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:15,520
and this this very reason is

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,639
why i started the project hopscotch

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,280
i was facing an issue or a problem which

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,919
is

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,639
there there was no api testing tools

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,599
works for

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,720
web web platform and i made that

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,919
solution

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,400
and at first i was the only user but as

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,440
soon as i started sharing it with

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,919
more my friends i started to realize the

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,440
app

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,599
requires more essential features and a

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,800
lot of refactoring that need to be done

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,520
so always start with one problem and

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,360
solve that

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,520
solution for one user and scale upwards

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,560
and the other thing which is the most

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,199
important of all

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,599
is being consistent with your project

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,800
never let your dependencies go

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:03,919
out of date always keep your repository

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,440
up to date accept contributions

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:10,720
reply to your issues or pull requests

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,520
as soon as possible so that is how

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,560
and why you should keep your

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,000
repositories

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:21,039
consistent and next thing is

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,840
always keep your community engaged

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,639
for hopscotch we have two very active

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,800
communities

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,199
one is a discord server and the other is

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,240
a telegram public group

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,760
we always discuss our upcoming features

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,440
with the community members

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:40,800
and get feedbacks on uh how to do it or

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,200
if we encounter a bug which is

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,839
uh you know affecting a lot of uses we

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,839
always

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,120
ask for the community members on

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,519
feedbacks

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,279
also you should try to promote your

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,000
project very often

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,240
this can be done in lot of ways but from

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,120
my personal experience i believe

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,800
documenting your project whether through

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,000
a blog or a

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,959
github read me everything works i wrote

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,240
a blog

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,640
and document your progress is the single

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,360
most

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,640
best way to promote your project share

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,959
your obstacles

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,040
share how you solve them there are

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,519
developers who are eagerly waiting to

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,279
see

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:24,480
how you did that and the next thing is

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,959
well the project consists of me

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,240
and one of my partner andrew bastian who

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,279
lives in canada

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,399
we are the car developers and we always

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,399
ask others for help i am a friend and

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,640
person and my partner is led back

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,040
back in person everything related to

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,000
backhand is single-handedly done by him

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,640
and with the help of the community i and

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,959
him

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,160
always ask for feedbacks and help from

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,360
the community

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,360
and we are always keen to do it so this

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,399
always help us to keep the community

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,800
engaged

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,519
and this this results in the betterment

00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,519
of the project

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
so even though if you could scale a

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,480
project to a lot of

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,839
uses how can you make a project

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,079
sustained

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,040
so sustainability of an open source

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,760
project with

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,079
which has lot of parameters in which the

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,360
finance or the monetization part

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,839
plays a crucial role in hopscotch

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,399
we find a lot of ways to monetize our

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,440
project

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:28,720
and these are the most super simple ways

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,880
on how everyone can find a way to

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,680
monetize their own open source project

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,279
you know building a recurring revenue uh

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,040
for your open source project

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,399
so the first one which is the most

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,640
obvious one

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,720
accepting sponsorships and donations

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,880
from your potential users

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,440
every open source project has this

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,800
philosophy of gratitude behind it

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,120
the uses are agreed to

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,399
show the gratitude in terms of financial

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,959
support as well

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,120
and to do it there are a lot of projects

00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,600
github sponsors open collective are

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,720
doing

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,680
extraordinary things to do so i

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,399
i advise everyone to add a sponsorship

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,000
button

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,760
to your repositories and even

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,200
organizations

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,079
the second most one is self-hosted

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,200
instances

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:20,560
so after evaluating our traffic

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,000
we realized that our 48 percentage of

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,040
traffic were coming from

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,320
developer communities in countries like

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,000
china singapore even from india and

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,680
one thing very peculiar about these

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
communities are

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,600
they they prefer a self-hosted instance

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,680
rather than a public domain

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,640
and obviously there are a lot of reasons

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,360
for this like

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,079
bandwidth issues and all but you can

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,959
actually find

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,800
a monetization plan on self-hosting you

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:50,320
are on open source project

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,360
if it is self-hosting project do provide

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,120
guidelines on how to do it and if

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,880
someone is having trouble with

00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,320
self-hosting your project

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,480
help them and accept a fee for that

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,920
so that is about self-hosting your

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,079
projects

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,040
and the next thing is being a creator of

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,480
your project

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,560
you are the best one to educate

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,040
how to run your project or how to make

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,120
use of a project for others

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,360
for a project like hopscotch there is

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,000
literally zero friction to get started

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,360
with

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,079
but as the use cases increase or

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,839
if if the users requires a complex

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,800
functionality or a feature

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,160
they approach us on how to do it we

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,480
either

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,839
show them how to solve it or we solve

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,560
them by ourselves

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,240
and for that for educating your users on

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,519
how to use your software is

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,320
you can accept a charge

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,160
and the fourth most one is again one of

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,880
the most conventional one

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,519
you can release a feature or a set of

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,800
features

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:58,000
which comes with a paid plan this works

00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:02,000
very similar to software service models

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,320
or if your expenses server bills are

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,680
more than enough you you should you know

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,880
hope for this

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,279
this way on monetizing start accepting a

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,240
monthly fee or a yearly fee for a set of

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,320
features which you

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,480
think should be exclusive for your uses

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,000
and the fifth most one is the most

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,880
recent and most popular one

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,240
right now because it is accepting

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,360
investments from

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,000
potential investors if you or your team

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,760
can convince a potential investor or an

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,560
angel fund

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,880
on you know realizing a revenue model or

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,959
a business model in the near future

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,440
there are a lot of angel investors who

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:44,240
are looking to find open source project

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,120
so keep a pitch check with your project

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,720
and

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,800
ask for investors on potential plans or

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,839
collaborations

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,839
moving on so

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,120
even though if you are able to sustain

00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,199
your project

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,120
how can you even make an open source

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,120
developer tools

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,120
if you look at the current proprietary

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,279
services

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,160
if you look at every of them you can

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,120
actually find

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,440
that every property service use at least

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,320
one

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,519
open source tool or library in its core

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,760
technology

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,320
in fact there are property services

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,920
which make use of 100 percentage open

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,399
source tools

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,000
so what does this mean for an ordinary

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,040
developer like me or you

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
how can you leverage the open source

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,279
community to

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,160
build or make another uh

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,639
developer tools so being a developer

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,639
this

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,639
open source community is the best part

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,079
that happened to me to build hopscotch

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,680
project

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:48,959
so start with a start with identifying a

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,760
single problem faced by a single user

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,399
then try to solve by introducing a

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,480
solution

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,720
and this doesn't have to be like rocket

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,920
science a simple workflow

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,839
in your workplace or a simple tool

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,360
which you think that might have been

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,079
better in

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,480
in you in another flow if you if you

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,760
find

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,560
anything which lacks a is find a

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,680
solution

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,639
and make an mvp even though you build

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,839
a solution for a single user always look

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,720
for an enterprise

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,800
level use cases so basically enterprises

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,760
are communities of single users

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,839
if one user has an issue the chances are

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,279
there are a lot of uses which face the

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,639
same issues

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:35,199
share your solution where developers or

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:38,560
your potential users are hanging out

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:41,519
subreddits developer forums extras are

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,440
very good examples of where developers

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,279
usually hang out

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,000
so after building an enterprise level

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:51,759
solution start to monetize your project

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,240
as early as possible again you can use

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,360
any of op monetization plans that i

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,240
mentioned about

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,639
start with a sponsorship or a donations

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,880
and

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,680
scale upwards so scaling again comes

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,839
with

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,240
uh you know starting with one user

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:11,279
sharing with 10 of your friends

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,839
and scaling scaling to your 100 plus

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,040
friends

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:18,240
documenting your progress and all so

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:21,040
this is how you can exactly build

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,160
and make the next best open source

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,800
developer tools

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,320
with the help of community and hopes

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,639
coach being a tool

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,600
built by the community and built for the

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,240
community

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:36,639
we are really proud to accept all these

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:39,600
contributions from our collaborators

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,199
you can follow me and my partner andrew

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,120

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,120
so thanks to github for github and

00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,639
partners for this opportunity

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,639
this means a lot to us

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,839
yes

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,240
thanks a lot lias that was that was a

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,959
really interesting session to know about

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,039
uh you know your journey in building

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,319
hopscotch and everything else that you

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,039
have come across

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,760
so all of you tuning in live uh if you

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,640
have any

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,679
questions for vrs drop them over on

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,960
discussions

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:31,120
on github satellite.com discussions and

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,240
we'll be taking up some of them live

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,799
here

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,440
for years uh we already have some

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,559
questions

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,440
uh you know coming in for julia's

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,000
and um i think the first thing that

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,640
folks

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,120
really want to know is uh how do you

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,240
find motivation to consistently work on

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,400
an open source project

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,760
okay so this is actually a tricky

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,080
question because

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,039
everybody has their own ways on finding

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,600
motivation

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,679
and how i personally did is i always

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,480
find that motivation is a personal

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,960
choice

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,520
if i want to do it i will find a way to

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,559
do it

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,960
and if i don't want i will find excuses

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,000
too

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,480
i want that so i believe motivation is a

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,679
choice that you have to make by yourself

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,760
and the way to do is is like the

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,520
example that i mentioned if you are you

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,640
know if you're like documenting your

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,120
progress

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,400
or sharing the news with your friends or

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,360
your communities

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,679
you will always have this push from them

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,120
to

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,600
deliver much more and that is the single

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,160
most

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,200
reason why i keep you know building all

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,039
those projects

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,240
and motivation is a choice that you have

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:44,400
to make by yourself

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,679
that's perfect so what's the most

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,640
difficult thing about managing

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,160
contributors

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,480
from different time zones because you

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:55,840
know they they are located everywhere

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,840
yes uh so as i mentioned the project has

00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,559
over 120 plus

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,960
contributors from almost every country

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,799
though

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:08,000
so how we did it uh well we kind of like

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:11,360
leveraged that uh you know issues with

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,640
opposite time zones to our uh advantage

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:17,520
and how we did it at any given time

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,720
either one of us one of the contributors

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,000
will be online

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,240
and whenever someone raises a concern or

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,480
an issue or a pull request

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,000
uh we will immediately respond to it

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,880
because if i am sleeping

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,919
my friend will be you know online at any

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,039
given time

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,799
and we actually leveraged that issue to

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,600
our advantage and uh

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,200
that that alone kept our community very

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,240
engaging

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,720
yeah great

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,600
so uh one other one other kind of like

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,039
uh

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,799
you know slightly different question

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,760
that's coming is

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,400
uh how do you really see open source

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,600
making an

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,919
impact uh making the world a better

00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,919
place

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,159
okay so being an open source developer

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,360
uh well apart from contributing to your

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,919
open source projects

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,400
there are a lot of ways on uh you know

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,880
how

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,679
how you can make a uh change in the

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,760
world

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,200
and it doesn't have to be like uh

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,240
writing code

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,880
it can be helping your friends in need

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,600
it can be you know being a part in the

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,720
decision

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,159
committee or it it can be like very

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,200
single justice like

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:34,320
responding to your uh concerns

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,200
raised by your users and all so all

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,240
those little

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:42,000
small things that we do are exactly what

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:44,240
makes the a better place yeah

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,360
great uh we've actually got a question

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,440
come in um from

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,360
adash who's watching watching your

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,679
session live right now which is great

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,640
so adash asks what does it mean to

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:57,600
self-host projects

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,919
okay so there are a lot of ways on how

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,760
you can self-host your project

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:07,520
and uh for a web web project or a

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:10,400
website uh and if it's a static site

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,200
which hopscotches you can always stick

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,000
to the free plans provided by github

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,960
or static hosting service like netlify

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,080
and all

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,240
and if you have a potential

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,919
customer who would like to have a

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,400
self-hosted version

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,120
uh you can have a discussion with them

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,000
and

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,159
you know charge a fixed amount for doing

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,039
all those self-hosting process

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,960
which is again one of the best ways on

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:40,480
how you can monetize your open source

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,480
project if it is self-hostable

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,039
perfect um i've got

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,159
oh yes go ahead go ahead anisha please

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,159
no

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,280
yeah i was um i was going to say do you

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,760
have any like

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,960
one or two tips that you can share with

00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,400
our viewers on

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,400
how they can quickly get started

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:06,720
okay so being a developer myself i

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,840
always suggest other fellows to

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,559
do three things one is

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,760
get too familiar with at least one

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,799
programming language

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:20,080
it can be any of your choice javascript

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,679
even html css any language which you are

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,280
comfortable with

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:28,559
and use github search box to find

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,440
projects that need help always search

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,400
for topics

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,000
like uh good time issues and or for you

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,120
know finding issues or

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,520
potential collaborations for uh newbies

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,679
or

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,840
you know anybody can do you start and

collaborators or core members

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,200
on how to get started with a particular

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,600
project

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,480
every open source project has this team

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,360
of

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,000
