[Music]

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,519
so welcome everyone for the state of

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,559
free in

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,040
open source software india discussion um

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,880
i'm going to quickly present findings of

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,880
our recently done report

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,320
but before that quick introduction about

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,880
me and civic data lab

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,760
so i'm gaurav hani i am director

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,160
co-founder at

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,760
civic data lab civic data lab works with

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,519
the goal of connecting data

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,039
tech design and social science to

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,880
strengthen civic engagements in the

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,960
country and how we do it

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,239
is actually a two-pronged approach first

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,559
improving access to

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,440
information majorly public information

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,600
using

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,640
free and open source software tools and

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,960
platform

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,840
and once citizens have the right access

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,840
to information

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,920
in their hands how they can meaningfully

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,000
participate in governance in local

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,160
issues in their democracy

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,760
so that's how civic data lab works and

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,360
we work very closely with

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,960
government agencies research

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,440
organizations civil society

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,559
organizations media etc

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,439
to grow their data and tech capacity so

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,640
it's very

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,320
uh important and uh for us to understand

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,479
the growth of free and open source

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,760
software in the country and how we can

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,640
play a major role

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,720
in helping these different stakeholders

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,960
work towards a common shared vision

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:26,720
of increasing india's digital ecosystem

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,159
so we did this report with the support

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,320
of omedya network india

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,840
we interviewed close to 51 first

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,000
researchers practitioners

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,520
across the nation um did analysis of 63

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,040
case studies on free and open source

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,360
software

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,720
read another 26 reports which were on

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,280
the similar topic

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,640
and framed our thoughts towards the

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,840
whole free and open source software

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,560
ecosystem

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,600
presented our findings and requested

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,920
eight eminent

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,000
uh experts from the community to review

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,880
the whole work

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,280
so just just just to get the basics

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,360
right

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,040
how we are defining foss so free and

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,119
open source software is a software that

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,399
is freely licensed to use

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,720
uh study change improve contribute upon

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,640
basically a piece of code which you can

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,200
make it break it

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,720
find different aspects of usage of it

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,440
and customize it

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,520
contextualize it based on your needs we

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,520
are referring force as an inclusive term

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,959
covering both the free software moment

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,160
and the open source software

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,920
world uh despite their

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,360
despite having different cultures and

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,120
ownerships they have

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,640
similar ownership models and that's what

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,080
we are going to focus on

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,000
so that's where we have taken more

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,080
inclusive approach of free and open

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,319
source software

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,160
so india runs on foss you won't believe

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,879
more than 85 percent

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,720
websites web servers are running on free

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,440
and open source software

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,040
uh most of this uh is something that you

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,200
might be using daily but might

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,879
but not be aware of so uh irctc uses

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,480
a lot of free and open source software

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,120
to help us do ticketing

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,120
train ticketing on time uh supreme court

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,080
of india uses free and open source

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,040
software

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,519
to do docker management of all the cases

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,120
and

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:16,319
uh help us uh do hearings at time

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,400
um lic india also uses free and open

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,760
source software to ensure life insurance

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,720
are done at scale

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,920
uh also bombay stock exchange help us do

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,159
stock trading

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,200
uh at scale using free and open source

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,959
software

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,720
all of them are using free and open

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,599
source software but

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,799
most of them uh don't advertise it so we

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,319
don't know that they are running on

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,239
final prints or software

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,519
and very few of them actually contribute

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,200
back in open source

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,519
that's where it becomes a bit more

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,080
tricky for us to participate

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,239
uh with them so imagine given our

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,720
developer community given all of you

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,319
and the amazing talent out there if we

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,760
could have created an open source

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,239
ticketing system

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,840
uh it would have gone quite viral with

00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,560
the kind of different use cases we would

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,200
have created

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,239
in india as well as outside so that's

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,799
what this report is all about

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,519
so to look into how the force ecosystem

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,080
has grown

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,840
we have to look into the timeline uh so

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,599
we have divided the growth of free and

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,000
open source software so far into

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,799
six major eras number one is the

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,799
inception of

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,359
force uh which is basically in 1886 to

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:23,840
1978 where

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,520
the whole new uh initiatives of free and

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,400
open source software happened

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,919
discussions on copyright were there etc

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,560
which gradually uh

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,600
led to the rise of free software moment

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,840
uh

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,199
the moment was led by richard stallman

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,639
and other people

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,000
from 1978 to 1989 shaping what the free

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,040
software ecosystem looks like

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,639
today and then the rise of community

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,520
businesses happened with the

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,479
discussions on open source and how open

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,120
source can help

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,320
co-create software in collaboration with

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,960
other actors

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,000
geographically distributed organizations

00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,440
working on different

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,120
kind of problems but similar

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,600
technological needs

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,759
uh then there are three parallel errors

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,160
the number one is the big tech fights

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,560
back

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,360
uh the open source uh which started from

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,840
1998 but gradually the big tech

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,360
uh found uh the benefits of free and

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,240
open source software quite helpful for

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,280
them so

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,560
around 2008 the dust has settled on that

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,080
um from 1999 onwards we have seen global

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,000
proliferation of free and open source

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,720
software with lot of communities coming

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,639
to even india

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,560
working and co-creating together with

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,320
different stakeholders on how different

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,440
open source libraries

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,600
projects can be scaled and expansion in

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,360
india of course have grown from 2001

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,960
onwards and which i'm going to deep dive

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,360
much more in detail

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,919
so uh we used to have annual conferences

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,240
like foss.n led by atul chitnis

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,400
bringing in a community of false

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,160
practitioners together discussing

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,240
how free inner pencil software ecosystem

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,199
can grow together we also saw

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,600
it at school project started by kerala

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,199
early in 2001 where

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,880
they tried to deploy free and open

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,479
source software in more than 12 000

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,080
public schools and they've scaled

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,919
fantastically

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,919
we have also seen government of india's

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,680
starting nrc foss which is national

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,720
resource center for free and open source

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,440
software

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,199
uh which has picked up in increasing

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,120
more government acceptance of

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,080
a force in their usage uh similarly we

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,639
started to see

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,400
states making some efforts kerala again

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,000
started icy falls which is an

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,120
international center for free and open

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,800
source software

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,120
looking for fostering research and

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,680
collaboration on how softwares could be

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,759
created

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,600
with the help of communities academia

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,479
and other stakeholders

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,840
we also saw starting of groups like sflc

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,240
which talks about the

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,160
licensing the policy the legal aspects

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,880
of free and open source software

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,039
and more and more supreme courts uh

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,639
supreme court establishment high courts

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,080
lower courts moving towards free and

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,560
open source software

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,199
so there has been quite a lot going on

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,039
and

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,800
gradually what we are seeing is more

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,639
businesses are evolving

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,639
uh keeping free and open source software

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,639
as core to their business model

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,639
we have seen zerodha chetfoot hasura

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,479
running their business operations using

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,160
free and open source software helping

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:20,960
other businesses scale up as well

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,720
so what this leads to is major false

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,720
opportunities for us in india

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,160
the number one is technical growth where

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,000
we have an opportunity to become a

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,319
global technology leader

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,080
in emerging technologies which are very

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,160
fast driven like artificial

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,520
intelligence big data machine learning

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,280
and so on the

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,720
enormous amount of talent in india is

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,599
quite focused to

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,199
build libraries and packages on free and

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,759
open source software and see

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,720
how they can scale up the growth so we

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,199
need to invest

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,039
more on seeing how this could be

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,520
catalyzed and there could be a strategic

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,840
mission

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,720
on moving forward with the new emerging

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,120
tech

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,960
second one is the economic growth with

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,639
free and open source software and the

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,400
ability to contextualize

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,240
and localize the software we can

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,560
drastically include

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,440
improve the financial inclusion in the

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,120
country

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:14,319
helping more young internet users

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,440
use internet to rely on better public

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,720
digital services

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,319
better digital services out there to

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,240
help resolve some of the issues they

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,360
face in their locality and lastly the

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,199
talent growth

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,000
i mean we are creating a common base

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,599
approach of creating knowledge pool

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,320
of resources be it data be it languages

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,599
be a different variety of local lived

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,680
experiences

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,839
all of it are proliferating in this

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,360
software ecosystem with the help of free

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,320
and open source software

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,240
so a lot could be done when it comes to

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,560
growing the forest ecosystem

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,920
and these stakeholders these four of

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,399
them are key

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,760
in moving forward this ecosystem the

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,959
number one are of course

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,720
you people uh the community of free and

00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,920
open source software practitioners

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,160
researchers

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,000
we have got a lot of them on a national

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,680
and local level in india

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,320
the second one is the educational

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,000
institutes like iit bombay

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,320
uh triple i t hyderabad iac bangalore

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,040
all of them are now trying to have fast

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,000
sales

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,279
even schools and colleges uh from tier

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,880
two tier three places

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,120
have free and open source software

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,920
related some education literacy

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,560
hobby groups there false businesses some

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,640
of them i

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,839
recently occurred like zero the chatfoot

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,320
and all and

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:36,640
even the msmes who are new emerging

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,680
technology partners are now looking for

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,920
free and open source

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,680
alternatives and lastly the governments

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,680
national local and regional governments

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,120
are also moving more towards free and

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,080
open source software so we are going to

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,480
look into

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,519
all four of them and the lens through

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,240
which we are looking at

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,480
is very simple four step growth the

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,240
first step is build capacity

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,760
build capacity to understand what kind

00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,640
of free and open source software is out

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,640
there

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,680
consume ethically work with different

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,320
stakeholders

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,360
to see what kind of licenses you can use

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,800
to improve

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,440
the growth of free and open source

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,600
software uh what kind of

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,040
libraries packages are out there which

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,360
can benefit you

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,200
uh contribute regularly once you have

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,480
built the right base you are consuming

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,399
it right

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,320
start contributing regularly start

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,160
opening up issues start

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,839
working with the community to find new

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,000
features start

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,000
participating in the development sprints

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,680
uh and the communities out there

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,600
to who are volunteering their time to

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,320
make the software ecosystem better with

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,399
you

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,760
and lastly once you have started to

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,000
contribute regularly

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,120
it's time to go collaborate and

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,720
co-create and

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,240
grow so have big plans for how these

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,959
softwares can grow

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,560
beyond one sector beyond one problem

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,240
scale to other domains

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,120
other areas in which this could be

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,839
scaled up so that's how we are seeing

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,880
foresees growth for all the different

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,880
stakeholders

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,800
present in the fos ecosystem

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,480
the number one rf community is my

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,200
favorite one so

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,959
i think one thing which we all are

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,560
facing as a challenge is the initial

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,920
barriers itself

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,160
uh for anyone who is trying to work uh

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,920
in the korean offensive software who is

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,760
interested to contribute

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,200
there are certain initial barriers which

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,839
we have all faced

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,800
uh let's try figure out how we can curb

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,279
some of these

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,880
for the new upcoming talent so things

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,720
like having leadership programs

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,399
mentorship programs like google summer

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,440
of code really helps

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:40,959
bring new talent to the existing big

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,360
free and open source software ecosystems

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,560
investing more on that uh would be

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,399
really helpful

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,240
helping with working with the academia

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,399
to find more such important

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,320
opportunities to groom the upcoming

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,600
false talent is something which we

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,639
highly advise second one is uh

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,399
having more diversity and inclusivity

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,240
we have seen uh most of the fast

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,160
communities are

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,760
under represented by different

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,920
marginalized groups

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,519
increasing representation of different

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,360
groups is very essential

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,839
not just to build a thriving fast

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,720
ecosystem but also to

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,680
build robust software uh if more people

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,360
are involved

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,120
most likely the software would be

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,000
beneficial for all

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,680
so uh programs like outreachy are quite

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,639
helpful for us to

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,160
move in that direction third one is

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,480
constrained con

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,839
to have more sustained contributions for

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,560
that to happen

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,120
i think nurturing community mobilizers

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,480
working

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,920
closely with them to understand how they

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,000
could be a succession plan

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,519
if you are a community leader growing a

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,880
community of say

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,680
python in in a geography city or three

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,160
city

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,200
you have to figure out how you can have

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,320
a successor

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,320
as well for you groom them so that you

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,279
don't face burnouts you don't face

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,000
issues related to technology overheads

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,279
and

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,560
community management etc so having a

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:11,279
nurtured community mobilizers who are

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,519
there for you to grow the community in

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,760
different direction is super helpful

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,200
and lastly having a global connect

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,440
invest more on research

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,920
invest more on collaborations working

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,639
with the communities out there

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,920
coming to events like satellite would be

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,320
super helpful

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,079
to connect and understand what is going

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,959
on on free and open source software

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,079
ecosystem

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,040
globally so uh investing on research and

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,320
collaboration would

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,240
be super helpful uh when it comes to

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,320
foster education especially

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,519
academic institutions there is still

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,240
quite dependence on

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,720
proprietary software dominance we have

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,279
seen

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,800
there is still less proliferation of

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,279
free and open source software in the

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,920
early education of computers

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,519
so what we are looking for is more

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,360
phoslet curriculum

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,199
and we have started to see some early

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,639
experiments from this front

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:07,839
where i t uh it education

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,880
in kerala has improved or also

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,399
um id for change in karnataka is working

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,120
to create curriculum

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,399
with the public schools in karnataka to

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,720
see

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,839
how uh free and open source software

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,160
could be promoted

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,959
in the early stages of learning in

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,399
computers

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,160
itself there's still limited force

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,000
education so where need

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,440
there's a need for more false digital

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,519
literacy programs

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,680
there's need for tailoring some of these

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,880
programs for local contacts local

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,199
languages

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,959
and fossee at iit bombay is doing a

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,160
wonderful job of doing the same

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,920
by creating a video repositories in

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,040
multiple languages

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:52,800
translating them for different purposes

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:55,199
uh for enabling first-time non-english

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,399
uh users of computers to start

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,000
programming

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,160
in some of the popular free and open

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,120
source software so please go and check

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,760
it out

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,279
um we still face the issue of poor

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,320
contribution and retention in the

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,160
community

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,440
and that is something which we can fix

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,720
by incentivizing

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,120
research and innovation uh supporting

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,880
young academic scholars to do more free

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,079
and open source software work with the

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,880
community

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,240
um enabling them to figure out how they

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,360
can

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,000
work in terms of incentivizing new

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,279
programs

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,360
for new researchers to plan different

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,920
uptake of existing free and open source

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,800
software in researching on the needs of

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,480
creating

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,240
new free and open source software which

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,880
would beneficial more

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,360
groups in the country lastly limited

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,480
collaboration academia also has facing

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,560
the same issue

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,839
so creating more open education

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,079
infrastructure

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,839
the way the kite program in kerala is

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,000
doing where they have

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,440
moved a lot of schools to free and open

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,880
source software

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,279
they are now trying to work with

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,040
colleges also to move in that direction

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,199
creating a common pool of

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,800
shared resources and especially in the

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:08,959
time of pandemic where

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,519
education is is least approachable for

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,000
people

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,360
who have limited connectivity a limited

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,360
bandwidth

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,120
um there is a need for more free and

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,279
open source software which can help us

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,040
take knowledge which is stuck with

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,480
certain group of people to more

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,920
community members

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,920
and the best thing about free open

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,160
source software in education is

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,360
students can learn it can make it can

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,440
break the software

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,120
and we learn the best when we break it

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,800
and and fix it

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,959
so that's the kind of opportunity we

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,320
have with the more free and open source

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,920
software-based

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:45,040
um education infrastructure

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,680
the third one is foss and businesses uh

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,399
even with businesses there is a limited

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,240
force understanding at this point

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,320
there is a need for conducting more

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,600
false workshops for early

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,360
group of people the

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,399
early businesses who are just starting

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,400
off it super beneficial for them to

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,000
see what kind of softwares are out there

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,640
which they can reuse

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,240
get some expert help on licensing get

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,640
some expert help on

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,600
what kind of business models could be

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,000
there for

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,959
them to build on free and open source

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,360
software

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,480
also get some legal and policy support

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,679
as they grow

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,319
because that helps them figure out how

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,199
they can

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,000
do force on a sustainable basis and

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,039
scale with

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,600
with it sustained contributions

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,160
even in small and big businesses is an

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,880
issue

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,960
uh first pro we need more fast projects

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,280
and sponsorship for different

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,160
first events which are business critical

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,520
mission critical

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,760
for you to grow so sponsoring events

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,799
sponsoring community sprints sponsoring

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,679
new uh

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,440
talent uptake programs uh is something

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,600
which we can definitely target

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,760
for businesses because that would not

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,679
just help the community but also help

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,760
businesses create more talent which can

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,160
work on some of this frost project

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,080
and lastly having more community connect

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,720
uh find opportunities to work with

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,960
academia find opportunities to work with

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,400
different communities governments

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,480
businesses can do a lot

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,679
by creating different collaboration

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,840
programs and

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,720
corporate social responsibility programs

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,919
to collaborate

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,240
more on foss lastly

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,600
governments so there is very limited

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,280
first capacity

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,160
with most of the government staff at the

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,000
moment what we can do is probably plug

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,720
some of the experts from the developer

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,480
communities to work with

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,840
different government stakeholders in a

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,840
fellowship model

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,640
beat local or national or state level

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,799
governments

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,480
uh to see how free and open source

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,840
software could be beneficial for more

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,600
number of people

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,679
uh this would in turn reduce the

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,080
dependence on commercial software

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,799
and we would see more public money being

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,360
used to create public software

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:02,000
and more procurements i.t procurements

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,600
would have false first mandate in them

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,320
also currently there are very few false

00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,039
repositories

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,080
from current uh different set of

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,120
governments

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,799
so encouraging them to publish more and

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,360
working with them to fix some of the

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,280
bugs

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,400
they face in the software would help us

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,960
create robots

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,200
uh public digital services and this

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,799
would in turn increase the reach of free

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,440
and open source software

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,080
helping us create more digital public

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,160
goods

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,559
which are running on free and open

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,480
source software for which the code is

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,559
open for people to collaborate

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,919
contribute and work with

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:42,880
and have a buck-free growth of

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,880
digital economy

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,600
and we are already seeing this happening

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,760
all these stakeholders

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,799
though they mean they seem quite sparse

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,480
but they are

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,240
coming together especially in the time

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,559
of crisis especially in

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,880
in this pandemic where we have to rely

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,799
more on digital collaboration

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,559
and come up with fast solution for some

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:06,080
of the crucial problems

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:08,880
we are seeing uh we we saw kovit 19

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,039
india a fantastic initiative where

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,799
different volunteers came together

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,080
overnight to contribute

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,200
and work and create a robust platform

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,360
for tracking

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,600
dc spread in the country and now the

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,159
vaccination drives

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,720
they are collaborating data they're

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,080
they're

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,240
crowdsourcing data from different

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,600
sources they're collaborating to create

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,520
robust digital maps and scalable mobile

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,679
applications and apis which could be

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,159
used for different purposes of research

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,280
and analysis on this data even economic

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,840
survey this year

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,960
quoted them as one of the reliable

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,919
source of

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,039
knowledge out there on covet 19 spread

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,200
we also saw

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:54,240
iise bangalore who recently published

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,960
city stimulator on how pandemic spread

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,760
may happen

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,640
in cities like bangalore see a vod voice

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,880
distribution

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,400
based on different parameters we open

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,960
sort this code so that

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,440
district administrators can use this to

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,559
plan

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,760
their uh lockdown initiatives

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:14,000
vaccination drives etc we also saw

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,039
businesses like ibm opening up their

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,159
genomics

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:21,679
research platform for faster

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:24,000
genomics research on some of the covet

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,600
vaccines which are out there helping

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,480
more academicians

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,640
and researchers to work faster with the

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,320
solutions they have and lastly we are

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,640
seeing government initiatives

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,159
like kerala government working very

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,159
closely with coronal

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,080
literacy network which is a volunteer

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,200
driven community network

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,159
of open source uh literacy knowledge on

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,679
corona

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,200
and a whole uh suit of software which is

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,919
used as a

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,720
currently as a base for uh control

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,080
center of

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,840
uh kerala kovat 19 mission so all these

00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,360
collaborations are already happening we

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,400
just need to scale them

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,679
and come up with a possible future where

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,159
more stakeholders

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,720
work together thrive together grow

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,720
together and clean open source software

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,640
and this is how it may look we are

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,679
calling this as a national force

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,799
alliance

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,679
powering growth of india uh if you are a

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,640
developer

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,400
and hoping to build more capacity of

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,840
younger contributors

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,360
uh activate more leaders we

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,280
participate in leadership program

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,120
yourselves or help others

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,760
groom their leadership skills so that

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,720
there is a thriving community

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,760
and bring more diversity we can't

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,640
emphasize

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,159
enough on that if you are an academician

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,400
who is looking to contribute on the

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,520
faucet ecosystem you can improve

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,520
on creating better foster c programs

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,720
help us foster more research on free and

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,600
open source software

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,679
build more talent uh to work on free and

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,679
open source software groom them

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,200
if you're businesses you can incubate

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,400
more first projects

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,960
you can create a marketplace of fos uh

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,880
alternatives which are out there you can

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,320
advertise the kind of fast initiatives

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,000
you have been doing so that more people

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,919
can participate with you

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
and you can support the existing talent

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,080
pool who is quite interested to work on

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,080
free and open source software

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,520
if you are a government initiative you

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,679
can work to create

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,760
more fossil act projects where citizens

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,640
can collaborate with you can work with

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,320
you and

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,000
ensure that there is better digital

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,640
service delivery

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,520
uh you can think of creating more for

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,760
stacks

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,320
so that the for software which you make

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,960
is replicable in other geographies

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,720
it's happening already with more

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,919
governments opening up their source code

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,919
so it's easy for

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,200
them for other governments to replicate

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:50,400
it customize it based on different needs

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,200
and lastly localize the localized based

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,159
on language

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,720
local contacts etc so a lot could be

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,520
done

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,880
in shaping this national foss alliance

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,840
when all these

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,520
stakeholders come together work together

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,559
with the shared vision of shaping

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,559
india's digital economy

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,919
and lastly this is the team who has

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,080
worked on this report

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,640
i am very grateful to all of them for

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,480
sharing their expertise sharing insights

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,919
and doing continuous research on this

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,440
topic

00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:24,400

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,360
at state of force dot in

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,120
explore the detailed first timeline read

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,440
more about different case studies

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,279
these stakeholders and how you can play

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,559
a major role in shipping the force

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:40,400
ecosystem

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:42,320
all of it is out there for you to access

was a

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,120
that was a really interesting uh

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,159
overview about

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,039
uh false and open source uh out here in

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,720
india

00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:00,240
so uh there are uh you know a couple of

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,799
questions that have come in but before

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,799
that

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,480
a reminder to all of you that guru is

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,559
going to be around on

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,720
uh get up discussion so if you have any

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,799
questions uh head over to github

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,440
satellite dot com slash discussions

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,760
where

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,919
gara will be taking up any questions for

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,960
the next 30 minutes

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,279
um so one of the questions uh that came

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,799
in

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:25,120
gara is um how do you see

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,880
like different stakeholders within the

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,440
ecosystem come together

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,679
to shape the future of open source in

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,279
india

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:38,080
right i think what we need is a national

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,760
forest strategy where we clearly

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,679
articulate what would be the role of

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,679
different stakeholders be

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,600
so just in my previous slides i

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,320
mentioned that if you're a community

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,279
member

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,039
you can work strategically to activate

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,840
more forced leadership

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,600
similarly if different stakeholders can

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,440
i can have a defined set of roles and

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,880
responsibilities we can all work

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,480
together to create

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,480
a thriving force ecosystem

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,679
great i got a question for you then as

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,200
well how can you strengthen

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,159
the community leadership in foster

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,480
ecosystem in india

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,360
i think the major issue here at this

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,520
point is

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:21,360
very less access to fos leadership first

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,960
mentoring in academic institutions

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,720
so partnering with more academic

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,640
institutions to have

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:31,760
false value education for

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,600
project education uh education about how

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,400
you can participate in existing foster

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,840
initiatives

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,159
some basic leadership and mentorship

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,240
programs

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,320
outreach is a wonderful example which is

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,760
trying to do that with the

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,520
final year students in different

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,799
colleges even in india

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:51,279
on how they can work to

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,039
contribute in existing fast projects

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,640
work very closely with the outreachy

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,799
leader

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,480
groom under them and once you are

00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,840
confident you can also become an

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,200
outreachy mentor

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:06,799
and help other communities to grow with

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:09,440
you so and this would also improve our

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,120
diversity inclusivity and equity in post

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,600
community which has remained a major

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,559
issue

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,559
especially in india

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,000
great uh thanks a lot uh kara for

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,760
sharing some of those

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,799
you know insights about uh false and

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,480
open source out here in india so

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,240
uh thank you so much for joining us

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:36,480
