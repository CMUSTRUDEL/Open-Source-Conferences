Title: GitHub Satellite India 2021 - Lightning talk: Flutter and GitHub - How open source changed my life
Publication date: 2021-03-28
Playlist: GitHub Satellite India 2021 - Open Source: Day 1
Description: 
	Presented by Kamal Shree, Program Manager @ Whatsupcoders

Since its release in late 2018, Flutter has become one of the fastest growing programming languages, and it is projected to grow even more with the release of Flutter for Web. Kamal Shree sees Flutter as a community-driven framework and is constantly looking for ways to keep the community engagedâ€”from SDK and plugins to libraries and more open source projects. In this talk, you'll discover how GitHub and open source helped Kamal build and grow Flutter, while connecting him to other innovators in the open source community.

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,280
hello everyone welcome to my session

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,440
flutter and github how open source

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,839
changed my life

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,279
well i'm kamal i'm a and flutter and

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,480
dart a youtuber

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,720
and a mentor well the session is not the

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,119
usage session where you talk about or

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,439
endorse about a technology or a tool

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,279
here i'm gonna share my experience and

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,679
the importance of open source

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,640
and how businesses are adopting open

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,360
source

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,280
and also how it impacted my career and

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,280
choosing one changed my life

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,280
and building a sustainable products

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,160
so i believe that managing an open

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,800
source project requires different

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,520
demands

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,840
and leadership and it's very true and

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,160
it's

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,160
completely changed my overall perception

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,280
and working style towards open source

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,320
project

00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,239
i think if it's managed right and if it

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,719
is delivering an industrial strength

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,199
system

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,239
that meets user needs and provides

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,560
solution

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,040
there are which are fully extendable

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,240
maintainable over a long period of time

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,960
the resulting code is so much consistent

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,119
and easier to manifest so let's see what

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,920
was my working style prior to open

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,159
source

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,360
definitely it was enterprise and closed

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,640
project

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,600
in fact i was quite content with it and

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,000
definitely open source or closed source

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,400
had

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,400
a lot of pros and cons where you had

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,280
strict guidelines

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,200
a very organized way of managing things

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,079
whether it could be designing documents

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,439
or coding

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,360
and testing or

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,439
avoiding you know what i i feel that

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,479
most of the enterprise organizations or

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,799
software's they

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,680
try avoiding taking risk as much as

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,960
possible

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,280
with a lot of approvals rules protocols

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,159
and finally the information was always

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,040
private

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,479
we had less number of information being

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,479
exposed

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,240
some of the pros that i would say about

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,159
an enterprise or an open source

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,680
or a closed source would be good

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,120
supportive system

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,120
user friendliness and unified experience

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,680
and i was pretty content with the style

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,680
of working

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,920
well before i start dwelling into open

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,840
source let's see how and when did open

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,800
source really start

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,080
if you see it started way back in 1950

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,239
and 1960s

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,160
we had compilers being delivered as part

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,879
of hardware purchase without separate

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,000
fees

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,480
wow that's interesting and in 1970s we

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,920
had

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:41,599
software from ibm in 1980 richard

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,840
launched gnu project in 1990 we had the

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,160
first version of linux was introduced

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,760
mozilla was started open source

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,000
initiative was started

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,800
and 2000 we had apache which was

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,840
developed and maintained by open source

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,959
we had mysql the first database php

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,319
which was almost

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,280
installed on more than 2409 million

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,319
websites

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,239
and with 2.1 million web servers

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,599
and the software which we use day in and

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,560
day out wordpress

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,840
vlc player notepad plus plus ubuntu

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,319
android flutter

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,760
and the list keeps on going so once

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,720
that's all indicate

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,640
this clearly says that all companies are

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,440
adopting open source and it's become the

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,440
future now

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,519
so did you know as per the survey 44 of

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,799
the organization

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,360
are using open source as a resource

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,879
or the as the rescue operations and

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,000
companies have started changing the

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,080
policy saying

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,840
do you have open source skills or have

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,920
you contributed to open source

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,280
rather than asking are you expertise in

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,120
a particular skill

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,879
so this kind of gives us a punch that

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,560
companies are really welcoming and

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,319
adopting open source

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,400
and the kind of impact it's creating in

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,120
the market

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,920
so working in an enterprise or a closed

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,560
project was

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,560
absolutely fine with me until then i

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,400
realized that i was feeling constrained

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,200
and kind of stuck and not flexible

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,640
enough

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,959
or i could not modify any features

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,280
one of the factors was the licensing or

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,200
the pricing which sometimes make me pull

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,799
and it does not allow me to get the

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,880
creative side of me

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,479
but i was always kind of accepting

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,479
whatever the existing feature was

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,840
so my journey started working on all

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
cases

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,199
i've actually started working on all

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,320
faces whole schools all the technologies

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,120
coming from

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,400
mobile cross-platform and now focusing

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,720
on building communities

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,639
i see most of us are under the street

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,919
concept

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:06,240
it's all free no when i say free it's

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,240
the freedom not in terms of price

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:25,840
well i think open source is all about

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:25,840
letting your creative

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,520
so if you ask me now okay come on okay

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,360
we got to know open source we know that

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,759
it's been started way back then

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,759
how do i get started if you're a newbie

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,600
and if you're already working on it good

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,440
but if you ask me where to start first

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,120
kind of look for the popular projects on

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,880
languages on github where we get a

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,479
monthly or a weekly report

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,800
talking about how the projects are being

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,880
performing types of projects

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,039
so projects could be security it could

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,759
be virtual reality ai

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,199
um or flutter or a simple text editor

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,520
you don't have to go for a complex

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,560
project and choose a topic that actually

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,479
interests you

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,840
then look for the volume don't pick

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,840
complex projects

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,919
look for projects which are labeled as

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,759
first time or easy beginner

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,600
get the taste of it and then start

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,720
getting your hands dirty with a complex

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,639
product

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,919
then okay fine i got to know the project

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,720
now what next

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,759
start fixing the bugs or pull request or

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,759
documentation

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,600
trust me documentation plays a very

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,199
important role which most of the

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,400
projects really lack in it

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,560
if you're really good at writing

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,680
articles documentation why don't you

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,000
start with one

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,600
or it could be a clean code clean code

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,120
doesn't mean to just remain the comments

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,319
are cleaning up your code

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,080
i mean trying to reinvent the wheel or

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,319
instead of reinventing the wheel try to

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,880
fix the functionality of

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,000
um doing a various functions or

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,639
something like that

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
so understand um what this open source

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,080
project is all about

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,479
how much time you need to spend on it

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,080
potentially is it used by how

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,080
who are the users or what are the

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,039
problems that this project has been

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,880
going through

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,880
so try to probe these kind of questions

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:15,360
and then try working on the open source

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,400
then what next so you know what are the

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,400
popular language

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,560
and you know what to do so there are

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,680
many companies based their projects on

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,000
free tools

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,800
uh even though where there are high

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,199
selection of

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,400
free softwares so i feel that instead of

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,160
reinventing wheel

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,400
try to look for the softwares which are

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,080
licensed try to play around with it

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,680
and if you find any feature that could

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,440
be actually open sourced

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,160
go ahead and do it what's stopping you

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,160
from doing one

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,240
and that's how my journey started into

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,440
flutter and github really played a very

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,840
vital role in

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,680
achieving this journey to me so if you

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,639
ask me what flutter is flutters is

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,879
google's ui

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,160
toolkit for building this beautiful

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,280
natively compiled

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,639
applications for mobile web desktop from

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,240
a single code base

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,639
let me reiterate that point from a

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,599
single code base we recently launched

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,440
frother 2

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,919
and it's the same code that ships the

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,759
native code to 5 operating system

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,240
yes you just listened to me i said 5

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,440
operating system android windows mac

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,080
linux and we also experience targeting

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,599
browsers like chrome firefox safari

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,720
and edge flutter can be embedded in cars

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,280
tv smart home appliances providing most

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,599
pervasive and portable experience for an

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,199
ambient computing world

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,880
and you can see the beauty of flutter in

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,719
my next slide

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,919
so this was one of the projects which

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,159
was developed

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,120
using open source where we have all the

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,440
aggregations of

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,959
libraries built by the community for the

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,120
community and it's

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,240
purely community driven you can see the

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,720
libraries you can

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,000
see the entire code you can see the pull

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,000
request you can see

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,320
issues being tracked so everything is

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,279
free and open source and github plays a

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,360
very big

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,360
role in getting this done

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,040
and these are a couple of open source

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,160
sample projects created by developers

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,160
like you and me

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,600
where this was built by the rife tool

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,120
and then we had the

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,040
um animations and uh the dragon

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,480
all this has been open sourced nothing

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,480
is kind of proprietary

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,000
or licensed so these are the kind of

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,760
work communities doing when we have

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,240
these awesome tools like

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,920
github and we have flutter sdk

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,519
and this is one more search tool which

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,399
is called the dart pad where

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,760
you can directly on online use the

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,279
online browser to build these

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,640
applications all you need to know is

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,839
just the dark language

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,839
and you're good to go

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,880
and then moving on we also had sample

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,959
plugins created by the

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,920
community people where these all are

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,760
kind of

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,279
issues that we face in our daily life

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,080
and we already have these ready-made

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,160
plugins

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,839
and user just has to plug in and use

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,959
them and they are good to go this is

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,160
also open sourced so flutter if you

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,680
would like to get connected

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,600
you can find ways to get connected

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,519
twitter github anyway

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,720
you will get connected with flutter and

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,720
i think this is something

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,000
that is also very important for building

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,880
a very rich

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,720
awesome community and we have one such

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,720
community called flutterista

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,160
where we are if you are interested in

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,000
joining one

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,160
it's actually if you identify as a woman

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,040
or a non-binary who have an interest in

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,120
flutter

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,480
join this community it's been run by two

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,800
awesome uh

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,920
fluttershy daniel and stephanie if you

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,760
want an invite just

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,079
let me know and i'll send you an invite

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,519
and you can get connected

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,680
so another open source that i'm

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,600
currently working is application

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,519
library engineering group it is focused

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,480
on building reusable application

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,880
components

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,399
that covers all platforms like android

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,959
ios and harmony

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,000
yes you heard it right harmony os it's

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,640
an operating system

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,320
designed for smart devices like smart tv

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,839
and it has been used as a mobile

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,680
operating system

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,600
here we try to build libraries that

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,720
support various fields

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,959
ranging from health banking i am media

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,519
music you name them and we have it there

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,320
we are targeting an ui ux design to

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,959
deployment reusability at each stage

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,640
and we are trying to minimize the r d

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,720
efforts and building the innovative

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,279
solution in a popular middleware

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,279
platforms

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,040
our vision speaks our work and the

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,519
process involved in building the first

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,880
free

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,880
open source community

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,040
and the structure of this reusable

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,040
component architecture is pretty simple

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,360
your functional definition your multiple

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,200
layouts and your configuration part

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,360
whether it's an action handlers

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,360
or it is an icon and you at the end you

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,800
have the end results

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,720
if you'd like to get connected with this

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,680
community you can connect using

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,480
all these channels and free fields to

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,120
contribute

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,279
open source partner with us and we'll be

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,279
glad to have you

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,519
and yeah that's it for today's session i

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,480
think uh open source is the future we

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,120
can see mobile

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,240
web cloud solutions are increasingly

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,560
built predominantly

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,959
on open source infrastructure future

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,959
architecture are highly to be based on

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,079
open source so what's stopping you from

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,399
building one

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,120
try it and see what wonders you can come

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,639
up with

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,639
