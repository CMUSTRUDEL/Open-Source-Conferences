00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,320

i focus on education and internet in

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,439
integrations

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,359
it's a pleasure to be here today and to

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,439
be talking to anan chaudhry who's the

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,760
creator of karuna 2020

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,199
an inspiring story during these pandemic

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,840
times

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,440
we are about a year into what has now

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,480
become a new normal

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,840
covert 19 has had a significant impact

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,399
around the world

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,680
but alongside all the uncertainty and

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,160
the severity

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,920
we have also seen a heartwarming and

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,480
inspiring initiatives

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,399
by a global and eclectic set of people

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,280
you know be it scientists

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,640
policy makers government officials

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,559
concerned citizens

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,760
or developers and they've all been

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,000
working together

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,399
at a feverish phase to help alleviate

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,239
some of the impact of this pandemic

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,479
there has been widespread and open

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,560
collaboration around cobra 19 and it has

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,200
taken many shapes and forms

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,040
from collaborative data repositories to

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,880
apps that provide and gather local

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,799
information to help the public

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,720
to faster application of scientific

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,119
methods through collaboration

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,200
and even diy devices many of these

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,159
are not really your traditional software

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,240
projects

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,960
and yet so many have been able to

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,960
leverage github's collaboration platform

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,640
that makes it easier for people around

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,079
the world to work together

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,400
towards a common goal so on that note

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,320
i want to extend a warm welcome to anand

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,159
who's here today to tell us more about

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,079
karuna 2020

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,439
an initiative to help those that are

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,840
most affected by government 19 in india

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,640
anand and his team brought together

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,520
startups corporates

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,280
and non-profits and partnering together

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,360
they collected donations

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,719
that helps them to build a dry ration

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,520
kit that could

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,439
sustain a family for about a month and

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,759
thus far they've been able to help

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,120
12 000 people and been able to

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,640
distribute one lakh

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:18,000
mosques to frontline workers indeed

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,040
an inspiring story anand and so over to

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,920
you

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,280
we are eager to hear more about how this

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,480
journey started

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,200
uh where we are along the way and uh

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,720
specifically how technology and github

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,599
has helped you in your efforts

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,000
yeah absolutely uh it it just happened

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,239
to be

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,519
it was not uh well planned in the

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,519
beginning i

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,040
usually live in the netherlands and i

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,040
came back to india

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,400
because uh i was like you know it's

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,319
lockdown season

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,239
uh you're gonna work from home anyway so

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,480
why be away from family

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,680
and uh and i was like okay let me just

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,800
get a flight ticket

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,959
maybe couple weeks uh if not more but

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,440
then that turned into a couple months

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,200
and then even longer and now it's been

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,440
almost exactly a year

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,120
that i've been here and in fact i'm

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,000
going to go back in about 10 days

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,319
finally i got the flight ticket back but

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,159
um

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,440
but so when i came came here for the

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,440
first time i was

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,200
doing my 10-day quarantine period i

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,680
think it was two weeks back then

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,920
as soon as i landed and my uncle who

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,120
runs unifiers which is a social

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,879
infrastructure company

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,480
where they focus on you know training

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,159
and skilling people of india

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,959
he came to me and he said you know it's

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,680
it there's not that much different in

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,360
our life

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,440
you know we're working from home we live

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,640
in air-conditioned departments

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,319
uh but there are so many migrant workers

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,720
out there so these are people who come

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,920
from

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,640
villages and uh smaller cities in india

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,519
who

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,480
find daily labor jobs uh where you know

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,680
they earn money

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,840
day to day almost like hand to mouth and

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,239
now that there is a nationwide lockdown

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,159
in place they don't have work anymore

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,840
uh and because of the lockdown also they

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,200
cannot go back home so they're stuck

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,439
here in the cities

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,280
with literally no idea how they're gonna

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,000
feed their family tonight

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,080
uh and so from this place of privilege

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,319
is that anything that we can do

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,079
and we you know for me i'm a technology

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,239
entrepreneur my whole background is in

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,320
startups i've been building companies

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,000
since i was in school uh through

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,919
university now

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,840
and so for me it's always like okay

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,880
there's a problem uh i'm gonna build an

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,639
app for that right

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,919
there's always a technological solution

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,520
in mind uh

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,680
but of course you you have to kind of

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,160
focus on the real grassroots work

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,800
and and so how we started is i was like

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,400
okay

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,160
let's see who's in my uh friend circle

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,320
and so we you know we built a dream team

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,160
almost of students and

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,160
entrepreneurs professionals and

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,120
corporates startups

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,600
journalists just volunteers in general

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,199
and

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,040
we decided we're going to get on a zoom

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,320
call every morning and then see what we

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,199
can do about this

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,560
uh so i started with building just a

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,320
github organization

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,479
and said okay let's get started from

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,080
here so let me quickly share my screen

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:11,600
and then i'm gonna show you

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:13,840
uh the repo absolutely

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,520
yeah so you know i started like i do

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,520
with all of my products right let's just

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,759
build a github organization

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,039
and we started by building a website for

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,880
corona 2020

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,560
this is our website uh it's a pretty

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,479
simple place where you can get

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,639
all the information about the impact

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,840
about uh all the data about what we're

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,479
working on right now

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,240
and and like you already said our we

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,720
decided that the best way to tackle this

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,160
problem

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,160
is to build a dry russian kit this is a

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,280
meal kit which consists not of

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,759
pre-cooked food

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,120
but of things like rice and lentils and

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,199
salt and oil

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,680
and a kit that costs less than ten

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,560
dollars can feed a family of four for a

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,400
whole month

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,479
so we decided that we want to raise

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,360
money and make these kits

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,960
and distribute them as much as we can

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,199
just a little bit about the site in case

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,520
you're curious uh it's based on

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,360
emergency site which is an open source

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,240
project that came out right during the

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,240
pandemic

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,919
with the idea that we might want to

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,319
build websites that we want

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,759
to be super fast in emergencies if

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,560
people are quickly looking at them from

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,560
their 2g

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,039
internet smartphones so it has things

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,000
like just one critical request with all

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,919
inline css

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,360
and so on and so we built on these great

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,759
open source projects

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,830
for our website and in general our

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,440
technology

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:32,720
[Music]

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,919
great and uh

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,000
i know that in current 2020 uh you use a

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,840
lot of github action workflows

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,840
for automating common tasks that are

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,639
otherwise manual and tedious and time

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,639
consuming right

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,560
yeah i'd love to tell you more about

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,840
that uh in fact i want to tell you a

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,000
quick story first because

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,960
in the beginning it was like i said it

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,599
was a zoom call

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,080
and a bunch of volunteers and we would

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,199
just

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,919
have this big google sheet where we

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,759
would just have

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,280
all of the data coming in you know what

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,440
are the donations coming in

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,560
where are we buying the food from how do

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,400
we assemble the kit

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,759
and then how do we distribute it and it

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,319
was just one

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,840
huge sheet and imagine like how messy

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,039
that stretchy can be

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,360
and uh so my friend and uh volunteer

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,720
uh shivek wrote this article about how

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,919
he likes to call it closure of

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,800
concurrency model

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,120
head of kind of fix this uh and so this

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,639
is

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,319
what he calls like the first version of

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,319
our runtime where everything's kind of

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,080
running in a javascript main thread

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,400
where we call these basing functions

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,080
which get data in and bring data out

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,960
but this can get very messy very fast

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,000
so we decided that we want to kind of

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,080
switch to

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,199
a closure concurrency model and if

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,759
you're interested you should go through

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,280
this

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,240
uh article i have a link in the

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,080
discussion but how we switched gears was

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,440
now everything is kind of happening in

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,840
cds and sets

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,479
so just imagine a donor life cycle model

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,720
where

00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,919
we receive information about a new

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,240
donation coming in

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,520
and then we would say okay we we will

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,759
identify the donor

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,879
we would move it to a column which is

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,720
ready for receipts

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,800
and then we would use for example an

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,360
automated github actions workflow

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,720
which would generate a receipt so let me

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,720
actually show you how this works in

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,840
airtable which is the client we use to

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,240
make this work

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,319
um so for example a new donation comes

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,080
in here in uncategorized and then we

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,840
move it to need to contact

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,080
and then we would use an api to send

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,840
them a message we would contact them

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,520
and then when we move this card to ready

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,719
for generating receipt

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,240
we run a github actions workflow wayward

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,240
which runs puppeteer

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,800
which is a headless chromium automation

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,440
tool which generates a pdf because in

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,039
india

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,959
for example when you contribute to a

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,440
non-profit you get an atg

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,440
tax receipt which you can use for your

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,880
taxes to claim that as a deductible

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,880
but of course we didn't want to do all

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,519
of this work manually because the goal

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,279
was

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,200
all of the manual work should be limited

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,160
to focusing on real grassroot

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,560
distributions

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,279
so then we move it move it and then

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,519
that's the whole

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,120
how the system works another good

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,320
example is distribution

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,440
uh because we use the same logic we fi

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,200
we get uncategorized leads from people

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,959
and then we ask them to make a list or

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,600
phone numbers or other cards so that we

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,440
can

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,200
know that it's a real distribution there

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,080
are real people in this part of town who

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,000
need our help

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,600
and then we approve the request assign a

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,680
distributor deliver it

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,120
uh and and one important thing for us

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,720
was transparency

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,320
because if we're asking people to give

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,279
us money and we're saying we're gonna

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,440
feed people

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,519
we need some evidence and so we decided

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,080
that for every single person who gets

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,600
a karuna 2020 dry russian kit we would

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,240
ask to take their photo

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,040
and so after the delivery we move it

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,440
into the

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,240
receive distribution pictures column and

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,040
we attach

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,800
all the photos that we received so of

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,839
course this is a privacy issue right so

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,640
we decided that

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,560
we want to blur their faces at least uh

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,600
so for example this is a real photo of a

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,880
real person

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,480
getting our kit and again using a github

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,920
actions workflow

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,279
we use a python library called face blur

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,040
a custom version of it

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,800
which takes all of these photos in

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,440
automatically blurs them out

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,240
and then uploads them to our cdn uh so

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,560
we created

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,000
a github repository called current 2020

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,680
slash open data

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,600
because we wanted to make sure that we

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,519
are accountable to our donors

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,519
and everyone gets access to all of our

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,519
data so how it works is

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,880
literally the same data that we have

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,440
here in airtable

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,399
using a github action scheduled workflow

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,720
shows up here

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,120
as api endpoints so for example if you

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,279
look at the api endpoint for

00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,200
donations.json

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,120
you can literally see every single

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,120
donation where it came from

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,959
who gave it to us how how much was it

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,600
for and the same with distributions and

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,279
so on

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,600
and all of this happens completely

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,600
automatically in this case using a

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,560
github actions workflow that takes data

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,880
from airtable

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,200
and then generates json endpoints and

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,920
then we publish this entire repository

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,360
on a github pages static website with

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,160
which you can consume these api

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,640
endpoints

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,079
so everything happens automatically and

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,240
that's kind of a little bit about

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,560
our tech with the github actions

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,640
workflows

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,000
thanks anna that makes a lot of sense

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,000
it's great to see this level of

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,519
transparency and authenticity that's

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,640
also getting built in you know into the

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,160
system because i can

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,680
totally see how that will build the

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,480
trust and the confidence among the

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,320
people who

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,200
would like to contribute in the form of

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,959
donations and and really see their uh

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,480
their money you know uh reaching the

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,160
right people and

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,160
and really it's it's wonderful to see

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,680
that github actions has helped you to

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,200
automate these workflows

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,959
and you know make you more efficient so

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,760
that you're able to focus on what you do

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,720
best

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,279
and uh just great to see that so what do

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,440
you see

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,000
as some of the next set of challenges

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,600
ahead and and how can the community

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,240
contribute yeah i think the community

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,480
has been

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,000
such a large part of what we're doing

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,760
here uh whenever

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
i'm free you know i just like to browse

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,079
through uh the github

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,279
topic for covent 19 and then just kind

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,519
of scroll around

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,720
to see what people are up to and there

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,120
are such great

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,279
resources out there uh some of my

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,959
favorite ones are the covet 19 data

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,880
wrapper from the new york times

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,600
which as it turns out also uses a little

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,519
bot uh which uses github actions to

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,040
fetch data from all of these different

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,040
sources and then

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,440
give it to you in an easily consumable

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,200
state-wise u.s data away

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,880
another report that i really like is

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,920
code 19 india react

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,519
which is a react website written also by

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,240
a set of volunteers

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,600
around the world and this is what it

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,079
looks like you can go to that little

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,399
website

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,600
and you can see all the cases uh

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,079
statewide data

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,720
find information about vaccination get

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,720
trends

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,639
it's a really fast really nice site

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,440
written entirely in react by

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,160
a group of contributors from around the

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,920
world

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,839
uh and i want to highlight one more

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,920
which is uh corona cli

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,079
because this is especially interesting

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,440
to developers it's made by my friend

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,839
and fellow github star uh emma and as

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,160
the name

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,959
implies it's literally a combined line

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,200
interface

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,399
where you can get data about the

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,880
coronavirus

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,760
uh city-wise country-wide state-wise in

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,760
your terminal

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,800
so so if you're if you're a developer

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,800
you don't even need to

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,240
leave your terminal to get up-to-date

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,480
statistics so

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,680
i think the community is really coming

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,760
together and

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,200
uh you know people it's so amazing to

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,920
see all of these people from around the

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,480
world

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,320
uh come together and trying to

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,399
contribute to open source and make sure

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,200
everyone has access to

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,639
the right data transparent data and

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,920
people are all doing this from their

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,360
homes in their free time

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,720
in a volunteer-led effort and so i think

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,360
really the solution to all of these

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,920
challenges are finding you know honest

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,519
data uh in in mitigating the pandemic

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,240
with even if you look at vaccination

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,279
data

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,279
is all of these volunteer led efforts

00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,320
that make all of this information that

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:03,839
is typically you know gate kept uh and

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,839
and make it open source

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,600
that sounds good great and uh and i

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,720
believe you mentioned that as part of

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,399
karuna 2020 as well you have leveraged

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,920
certain open source projects like you

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,839
talked about the emergency

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,839
uh um services

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,839
maybe you can tell us a little bit about

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,800
that experience you know consuming and

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,760
building on top of

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,720
somebody else's work and also how do you

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,120
feel about

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,079
um you know from the work that you've

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,240
done do you

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,600
see some best practices emerging for

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,240
non-profits

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,560
you know when it comes to you know sort

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,360
of building some of these workflows

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,040
and you know how do you think about that

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,000
yeah absolutely you know just as an

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,880
example if you look

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,440
at our website repository uh we don't

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,519
just

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,839
have an open source project so that we

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,720
can get the free github actions minutes

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,760
the idea is uh we're building on top of

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,519
all of these great

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,399
open source projects like i gave you the

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:03,040
example of the flavor blurring project

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,399
uh which we forked and shivek added a

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,680
feature that we could do all of these

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,360
requests in parallel

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,360
rather than series so that it happens

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,000
much faster and it's just a simple

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,160
python library that takes any photo in

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,920
and gives you a blurred version of it

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,079
and this was very important to us

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,560
uh because we knew that we have to

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,639
balance individual privacy with

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,480
making sure we are accountable and we

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,040
share photos for example

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,360
uh so we we it's we're really building

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,720
on top of this years of effort by other

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,720
open source people

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,759
and and like you said with non-profits

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,160
usually

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,079
you see there's a lot of manual work

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,560
like i gave you the example of the atg

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,720
tax receipts people usually generate

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,120
these by hand in an excel document and

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,839
then export it as a pdf and then send it

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,839
to people

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,440
and in our case we would just literally

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,160
have an a table record that we got a

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,920
donation in

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,759
we would manually verify it and move it

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,199
to a column and then everything happens

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,839
automatically that we use

00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:00,079
an api to send them a message we use

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,160
puppeteer to generate a pdf and then we

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,880
use node mailer to programmatically

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,320
email it to them as an attachment and so

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,480
the idea was

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,680
uh why stop here right we are just

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,000
volunteers who

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,040
for example i run a technology company

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
in switzerland

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,399
um we're only doing this in our free

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,560
time

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,600
as a weight is a really small way to

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,160
give back

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,680
but uh there are real non-profits who we

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,720
partnered with for example for the

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,560
distribution

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,839
who are doing this every day and they've

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,000
been doing it for years

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,320
so how can we kind of help them with our

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,120
tech uh to take it forward

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,800
and uh and and one really powerful thing

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,440
we did here was guides

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,399
so on our website you can have a look at

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,480
all of the

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,839
all of these free and open source guides

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,639
that we have written all of our

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,279
volunteers have

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,240
contributed to these uh and and they

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,240
tell us about

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,360
for example the face blur and identity

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,680
protection guide

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,160
where you can read how why do we want to

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:59,279
do this what parts of a face should we

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,120
uh redact and what technology do we use

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,639
uh how do you install it how do you use

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,520
it uh and so on

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,720
and for and even like more specific

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,039
things like are

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,480
russian kid how do you assemble it what

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,160
should go in each kit

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,760
uh how do you package it how do you make

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,439
sure the people who are distributing

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,039
them are always safe

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,079
um or our distribution management guide

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,000
about how do we

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,360
manage distributions our donor life

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,400
cycle management guide where you can

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,799
have a look at

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,559
how do we get people to fill the form

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,320
when we get the donation what do you do

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,120
when you don't know who a donor is how

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,440
do you offend them

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,960
so the idea is we wrote all of these in

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,320
markdown format and put them in our

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,559
github repository

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,960
and you can have a look at all of these

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,960
um and you can and literally like

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,039
just things that are not related to the

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,400
distribution for example our social

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,080
media outreach guide

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,760
tells you that hey we should tell all of

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,880
the people who have donated about what

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,840
we're working on

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,400
um how do you design each social media

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,080
post

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,440
and we made a little template with you

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,679
which you just had to edit

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,640
with the new distribution and then all

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,960
of this also

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,360
is completely automated so whenever we

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,480
receive the photos of a distribution

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,960
we assign it a social media outreach

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,600
card

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,559
also linked to it so as you can see here

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,400
this card is linked to this record and

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,320
in that card we have a little note just

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,360
a description about what we did

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,120
some photos and a hero image and all of

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,880
this works with the same model

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,960
where when we have an idea we upload

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,720
some photos we design the graphics we

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,559
write the text and then as soon as we

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,880
move it to publish to website

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,919
this automatically again using a github

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,760
actions workflow

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,360
shows up over here in our updates and

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,440
people can share the link

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,360
and we also use some automations to

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,200
automatically tweet about it and so on

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,720
and so we've set up all of these systems

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,880
in place not for us

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,799
but with the idea that using our open

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,520
source guides and all of our open source

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,520
code

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,240
other non-profits can build on top of

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,360
this or at least just use these to make

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,280
their manual work

00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:02,240
much easier the second quick note is

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,760
because of github's powerful platform uh

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,280
we use github actions

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:10,400
not just for automating things but also

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,840
for scheduling cron jobs and then we use

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,880
github pages to deploy

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,600
our website this literally means that

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,760
we don't need a server we have no

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,440
digital ocean droplet or whatever

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:26,160
ec2 instance um because the idea is

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,720
all of our programmatic uh you know

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,440
tooling

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,280
generation build time stuff is happening

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,360
in a github actions workflow

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,120
and so this is very powerful because if

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,360
you have an open source repo you get

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,039
unlimited free minutes which means all

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,520
of the other non-profits that we work

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,679
with

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,400
can get all of these great systems in

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,000
place literally completely for free

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,919
running in github actions workflow

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,520
rather than using uh you know

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,320
specific servers that you have to pay

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,440
for and so the idea was that with our

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,120
guides where we've

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,480
thoroughly documented everything that

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,200
we're working on and

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,160
with our source code uh we don't want it

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,080
to stop here

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,000
that we're done with our part we want to

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,000
make sure that other non-profits and

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,080
other people can build on top of it and

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,679
then make sure that we all do our little

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,679
part uh to giving back

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,480
makes sense and i think uh you you

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,440
highlighted a good point around how

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,480
uh grab actions really takes away a lot

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,600
of the burden

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,080
of you know uh maintaining servers and

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,880
you know

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,480
with the compute being with github it

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,520
enables people to

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,720
quickly be able to really put their

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:37,840
um uh you could say you know their logic

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,679
into action you know and um um so so

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,880
that's uh a really great point to

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,320
highlight

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:47,679
and um so so you know a lot of us

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,400
uh you know we we all want to help

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,520
others

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:54,000
and we all have ideas about it

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,520
or maybe the desire to help but not

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,720
everyone is able to

00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:01,520
convert that into into action and

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,000
uh any words of advice from you uh for

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,559
others

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,760
you know who who who really wants to

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,400
give back

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,480
and you know um you know what does it

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,840
take to really take that the first

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,720
critical step

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,120
or what have been some things that have

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,400
uh

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,440
been important in uh enabling you to

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,280
succeed in your efforts

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,880
i think this is kind of a two-way thing

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,480
right there's

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,400
how do you start right you start by

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,440
starting and that's what we did you know

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,559
we didn't have

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,120
a big distribution center or ideas of

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,200
what

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,440
we want to do in the future but we just

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,039
started with the open source project

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,559
and and thought about okay how do we

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,880
take it forward from here

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,400
um and and i like to start all of my

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,280
projects like that if you have a you

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,440
know idea

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,320
you build a repo quickly and just think

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,159
about it

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,159
and then you kind of take it forward

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,960
slowly over you know days and weeks and

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,320
years

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:59,440
uh so you know the gatekeeping is

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,000
non-existent now uh i because if you

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,559
look at

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,240
any project like we saw already in

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,559
github satellite there are so many great

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,679
open source projects that all started as

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,200
a tiny idea

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,880
and you want to build it into an open

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,720
source product and if you want to

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,720
contribute to them it's become

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,240
easier than ever right there are so many

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,679
great guides out there about

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,840
how do you do make your first pull

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,559
request uh and and there are

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,280
concepts like good first um good first

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,520
issue

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,360
or up for grabs where you could filter

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,799
out issues that need help

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,400
and i think you know the best way is

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,640
just to get started

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,480
uh and you know i'm saying this because

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,440
usually people watching get up satellite

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,360
are technical

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,120
and the best way to give back could be

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,799
spend a little bit of your time

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,720
in giving back to open source projects

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,559
that you use or open source projects

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,960
like ours that are trying to

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,799
help people during the pandemic but the

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,280
second part is really about the

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,280
the distribution and the manual work

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,360
right you can give your time away

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,320
you could volunteer to projects but i

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,760
think

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,840
you know because for us personally it's

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,280
it's really about privilege right it's

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,919
about the fact that we've been in

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,360
lockdown

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,240
uh for a year now and and not much has

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,240
changed

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,440
uh you know i i go to work every day

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,120
from my laptop

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,120
um i i get a good salary i i write code

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,600
i contribute to open source projects

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,320
but there are so many not just tens or

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,080
hundreds

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,919
but thousands and tens of thousands of

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,840
people out there whose

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,280
experience has been completely different

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,520
like i said in the beginning

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,720
migrant workers here in delhi who don't

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,080
know how they're going to feed their

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,400
family tomorrow

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,760
uh maybe today but just because the

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,440
entire job was

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,960
of the idea that every day we're gonna

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,600
do a little bit of work on a little bit

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,919
of money

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,640
and then somebody takes that away from

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,440
you

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,279
uh so i think it's not just about the

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,840
technical part of making your first pull

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,600
request

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,440
although that could be very powerful as

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,520
well it's about

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,440
how can you look at your toolkit right

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,760
are you a designer or a teacher

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,640
or a student or an engineer and what you

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,799
know how to do

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,840
and how can you use those tools as a way

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,559
to give back

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,000
and i do your little part right because

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,600
when you're talking about this

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,360
scale this pandemic and so many people

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,200
uh who we can do something for and who

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,120
we should have empathy for

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,640
every little bit helps and i think

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,000
that's why you know i started by saying

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,000
just start by starting

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,279
do your little part because we're like

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,120
tiny compared to

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,400
all of these great open source projects

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,080
out there and you know with

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,760
tens of thousands of contributors

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,960
working from around the world

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,400
uh and and of one common good uh one

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,159
common goal that you know

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,840
there's a pandemic and we can spend our

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,799
free time and do our little part on

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,559
giving back

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,799
uh and so i think you just start by

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:43,600
starting uh look at what's out there

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,360
and you know contact people see how you

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,640
can make your first pull request

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,000
or or volunteer or give a little

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,559
and like i said you know we're a tiny

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,120
part of it but uh every part really

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,480
counts

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,679
and so you know i would say you

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,960
shouldn't be you shouldn't feel

00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,360
hesitated at all

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,320
just start by starting uh do your little

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,640
bit and then

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,320
see you know what kind of impact it can

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,039
do for us it was like

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,360
a tiny open source project one repo and

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,200
then

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,640
literally tens of thousands of people

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,960
now not being hungry

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,799
hundreds of thousands of masks to

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,240
frontline health workers to police

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,240
personnel

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,600
all in a matter of just weeks just

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,720
because we started

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,919
uh yeah makes sense anand

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,360
that makes a lot of sense and i'm just

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,240
going to echo sort of what you said

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,520
which is

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,080
that first of all no effort is you know

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,320
um

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,600
is is small it's like every little thing

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,840
that each of us

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,360
is good at uh we can use that to

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,159
contribute in some way or the other

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,000
and today uh in the uh you know in the

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,480
world we have platforms like github

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,840
that make it so much easier for people

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,080
to um

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,960
meet with other other people in the

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,400
community

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,400
and you don't necessarily have to start

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,960
something from scratch you can join an

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,039
existing

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,799
effort because something that you do can

00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:00,159
contribute and add value

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:03,039
and uh really it's a great way to

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,240
uh to learn and share and along the way

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,559
to do some good

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,279
so um it's this you know your story adam

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,520
has been very

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,960
inspiring to me for sure and i hope that

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,679
it's going to be the same for many

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,159
others

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,320
a great opportunity to to use their

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,640
technical abilities or whatever

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,360
are their core uh competencies and you

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,720
know uh

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:25,279
contribute um and um really

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,120
start like you said um it has been a

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,880
pleasure talking to your aunt your story

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,000
definitely serves as an example to so

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,320
many others

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,200
and it's great to see that you you you

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,120
started you

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,880
put this into action and you leveraged

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,240
tools and technologies to help you do

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,480
your best work

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,600
and i'm really proud to be a hubber and

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,679
see how github

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,799
is playing uh such a big role in

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,559
enabling people

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,960
and it helps them to make a bigger

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,880
impact in the world when it matters

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,279
so thank you again anand for being here

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,600
today and folks uh we'll be

on another and i will be on discussions

00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,080
right after this

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,840
