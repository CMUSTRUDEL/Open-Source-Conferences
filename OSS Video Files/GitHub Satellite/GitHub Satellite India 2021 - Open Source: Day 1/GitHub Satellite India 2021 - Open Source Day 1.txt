back over the course of the last year

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,599
and celebrate the growth energy and

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,640
passion

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,720
of the developer community in india i

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,960
can't believe that it was a year ago

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,200
that we launched in india and it's still

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,720
one of my favorite experiences since

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,720
joining github

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,040
as i told folks when i arrived back to

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:38,720
the us the positive energy

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:40,480
and drive here is palpable it was such a

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:43,920
thrill to get to be there for our

00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,520
first ever meetup in india and meet some

00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,160
of our campus experts

00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,960
hear from project maintainers and get to

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,800
know developers from across the country

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,400
getting to meet up with folks in india

00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
and learn about the work you were doing

00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,680

00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,880

million developers have joined github

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,400
the developer community in

india now totals 5.8

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:53,680
million developers strong together

00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,880
you've created 7.3 million repositories

00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,720
new projects

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,359

down to the simplest comment on an issue

00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:23,200
to be a responsibility

00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:24,880

like her in india

00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,960
who are embracing these qualities are

00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,520
actually lowering the barrier of entry

00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:12,000
for new developers to open source

00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:14,720
this is going to be a huge contributor

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,960
to the growth of open source in india

00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,119

developer live starts and ends with

00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,990
coding and github helps us

thank you thanks rohit

00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:09,599
now let's hear from a young company

00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:11,520
that's relying on github to provide the

00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,800
best possible experience to its

00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:15,040
developers

00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,800
udon is a unicorn startup that's

00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:19,520
bringing manufacturers

00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,520
traders retailers and wholesalers

00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:23,040
together into one platform for

00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,200
enterprise commerce

00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:27,599
they're using automation many

00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,839
integrations and streamline workflows to

00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,960
support over a thousand developers on

00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:32,720
github

00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,119
i'll let udon's head of software

00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:39,119
engineering and application development

00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:40,880
kaushik to tell you more hi i'm kaushik

00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,720
i had software engineering and

00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:46,000
application development at quran

00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:48,800
when a new engineer comes on board

00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,400
he already is aware of github so from an

00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,200
onboarding standpoint

00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,520
from understanding a tool standpoint

00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:58,559
that has already been taken care of

00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:01,839
purely because of the kind of reach

00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,800
that github has github has been doing

00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:04,570
over the years

00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,559
is it's been able to

00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:08,800
[Music]

00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:10,559
think of developer workflows and how do

00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,599
you end up optimizing

00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,480
those workflows does and when i say

00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,160
optimizing

00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,480
bringing in the right kind of

00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:21,760
automations which might be required

00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:24,319
which ends up minimizing

00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,000
interrupts that a developer typically

00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:28,480
has to go through

00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,280
there are certain repetitive tasks right

00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,520
which

00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,359
you would want to take off the plate of

00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:36,720
an engineer

00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:38,160
github actions enables us to plug in

00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,520
various kinds of

00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:44,880
linter tools that can actually help in

00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:46,960
automating some of these uh you know

00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,079
pr reviews for example that need to

00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,839
happen and

00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:52,000
at some point in time depending upon the

00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:55,119
quality of that code

00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,240
auto push into a build pipeline

00:50:55,119 --> 00:51:01,520
thus optimizing our ci cd right

00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:03,760
having that much more time for the

00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,480
engineers to focus on the real problems

00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,720
while

00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,079
the ones which are repetitive which a

00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,240
lot of engineers see as

00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,000
interrupts right being taken away from

00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:14,240
them

00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,160
i love hearing about the ways these

00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,200
companies are using github to build

00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,440
their business

00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:21,760
and the way all of you are growing your

00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,240
businesses on our platform

00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:27,040
but of course most startups aren't

00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:29,760
unicorns with thousands of developers

00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:32,000
most consist of a few dedicated people

00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:35,599
who are working hard to solve a problem

00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:38,079
and make an impact and like the unicorn

00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,839
these startups need access to tools to

00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:42,240
help them work efficiently

00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:44,160
overcome challenges and attract the

00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,000
right talent

00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,440
we want to support these startups

00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,079
whether they're early on in their

00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,559
journey

00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:52,160
or are taking off after finding product

00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:54,240
market fit

00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,800
last year along with our investment

00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,800
partners we ran a pilot of a startup

00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,760
program to offer github's full

00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:04,000
enterprise platform to startups in india

00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:07,520
the program was a huge success

00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,599
with over 200 startups participating

00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:12,800
those companies are doing incredible

00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:15,119
things kowa space is building a solution

00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,559
to solve the geospatial requirements of

00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,960
tech companies

00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:22,160
clearquote is creating an ai led

00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:24,720
automation app for vehicle inspections

00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,559
and air meet is bringing people together

00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,760
which is more important this year than

00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:30,079
ever before

00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,599
by providing a platform for hosting

00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:34,480
virtual events

00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:36,800
it is an honor to be just a tiny part in

00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,880
the grow stories of these companies

00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,880
and we know that there are so many more

00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,960

next year

00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:56,480
these companies will get access to

00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,520

a year from now speaking of innovation

00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,680
and growth

00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:29,839
at github we believe it's just as

00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,720
important to support the next generation

education institutions to github's

00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:55,040

which is supported by 74 campus experts

00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:59,280
during our launch last year i was able

00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,680
to have lunch with a few of these folks

00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,839
and i was blown away by the energy and

00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,640
the passion and the dedication they have

00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:07,200
to supporting

00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,880
others in learning to use github and

00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,319
participating in the open source

00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,640
community

00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:14,800

00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:32,079
for me being a campus expert is having

00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,680
the ability and responsibility to

number of events with ease

00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:41,760
by equipping me with the required tools

00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:43,680
and resources but most importantly it

00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,440
gave me an opportunity to meet with so

00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,440
many people that i never even

00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,359

is a lot for

01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:00,079
satellite in the sky so i should i think

01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:02,000
i should probably go grab my telescope

01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:05,280
to see what's happening you know

01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,079

tell you

01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,839
what is going on with satellite over the

01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,920
next two days

01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:13,280
so as you know we have two days worth of

01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:15,680
content four

01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:17,760
hours a day plus workshops which we'll

01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:20,079
share a little bit more about with you

01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:22,000
as well um and we've got two channels as

01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:23,760
you can see on the screen right there

01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,599
we've got the of course the open source

01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,599
channel uh which you're

01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:29,520
watching us right now and we'll be

01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:31,440
featuring the best of open source here

01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:33,359
and then you can also hop on over to the

01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,760
devops channel where you can join our

01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:36,000
friends

01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,520
divya and morehead as they dive into

01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,880
everything about devops

01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,559
and don't forget you can alternate

01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:43,039
between two channels as well

01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:44,640
and you can do that right in the top now

01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:45,760
up there as well but don't forget when

01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,920
you do alternate

01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,880
um the channel will be muted so don't

01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,119
forget to end me

01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:52,720
and if you miss it then i'm afraid

01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:55,839
that's it right karen right

[Music]

01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:45,599
hi everyone my name is leah thomas i

01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:46,400
co-created hope scotch open source

01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,799
project

01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,400
hopscotch is an open sourced api

01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:52,640
development ecosystem

01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,440
and in the next 20 minutes i will be

01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:55,280
unveiling

01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,480
the inspiration behind starting the

01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:58,720
project

01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,559
along with our journey so far some of

01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:03,920
the obstacles that we faced

01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:06,640
and how we managed to solve and scale

01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:10,720
hopes coach to our 170

01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:13,119
000 plus users from around the globe so

01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,920
also the most important thing i will be

01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:17,359
giving out

01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:18,079
five super simple ways on how you can

01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:20,799
monetize

01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:21,599
your own open source projects and at the

01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:24,079
end

01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:25,760
i will be discussing the future of open

01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:29,920
source developer tools

01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:34,000
so without further ado let's get started

01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:37,119
so this happened in 2019 august 21

01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:39,039
i was a fresher just joined in a very

01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:41,280
early step startup just after my

01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:44,640
engineering graduation

01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:45,280
and one of the first tasks that i was

01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:48,720
assigned

01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:51,760
is api integration of a project

01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:55,119
there were like 100 plus api endpoints

01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:58,799
for me to test and bind it to the ui

01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:59,520
so so that was the exact day that i

01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:02,160
realized

01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:04,079
there is this category of tools called

01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:07,200
api testing tools

01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:09,680
and guess what i actually went on a hunt

01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:11,680
to find a simple solution that would

01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:14,799
allow me to test my apis

01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:15,599
without you know making much effort i

01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:18,559
even tried

01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:21,039
downloading one popular app but it ended

01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:24,240
up crashing my 10 year old pc

01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:26,960
and realizing all such tools are

01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:28,079
you know causing a lot of cpu

01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,880
consumption

01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:33,119
i was very frustrated because at the end

01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:35,039
of the day if i don't get my job done

01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:36,240
i'm gonna get fired from my first ever

01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:39,280
tech job

01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:40,559
so at that night itself i decided to

01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:43,680
create a tool

01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:44,240
which operates in my web browser so that

01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,720
i can

01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:48,240
i can you know test my aps directly from

01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:50,240
the browser window itself

01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:52,000
without switching back and forth between

01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:55,359
multiple apps

01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:58,559
and within like two to three hours

01:07:55,359 --> 01:08:01,839
i created a very minimal mvp

01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:05,599
which looked something like this

01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:08,559
so you can see exactly how unpolished

01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:11,599
or incomplete the first time vp of hope

01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:12,640
squash looks like this is the first ever

01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:15,760
initial commit

01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:17,120
that i made on github for the hopes

01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,199
coach project

01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:20,880
it is pretty simple you just have to

01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:23,600
enter the api endpoint

01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:24,000
choose a method and just click send and

01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,600
you will

01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,600
get the response beneath it so

01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:31,839
if there is anything or if there was

01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,719
only one thing i want you to remember

01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:35,520
from this session

01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:37,600
it should be this never be ashamed of

01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:40,159
your initial question

01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:41,440
and if your first launch doesn't look

01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:43,359
somewhat like this

01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:44,960
the chances are it's probably too late

01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:47,440
to launch so

01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:48,960
ship your product ship your idea as soon

01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:52,560
as possible

01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:53,679
so moving on after making the initial

01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,560
commit

01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:59,040
i felt very proud of myself i went i was

01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:01,199
very satisfied with what i have done

01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,719
i really wanted to share the news with

01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:06,080
the community

01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:08,640
i made this single web page application

01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:09,600
and hosted on github pages thanks for

01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,640
github because

01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:15,920
github pages is the most simplest way

01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:17,440
to host a static website and hope scotch

01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:20,319
being a 100 page list

01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:23,359
jacket site it was it just took me like

01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:26,159
couple of minutes to do that

01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:27,839
after launching the mvp in github pages

01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:31,440
i also wrote a blog

01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:33,279
on my dev dot profile and i i went back

01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:36,239
to sleep

01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:37,759
the next day when i woke up i actually

01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:40,560
woke up to this hundred plus

01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:41,359
notifications on my smartphone most of

01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,759
them were from

01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:44,719
github there were a lot of issues there

01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:47,199
were a lot of

01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:48,319
future requests lot of comments on the

01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:51,040
project

01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:52,400
i started to realize that within like

01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:55,840
six to eight hours

01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:58,640
i mean in overnight i had 100 plus

01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:00,239
active uses using the first evolution of

01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:02,800
hopscotch

01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:03,760
over the week i tried adding a lot of

01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:07,520
more features

01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:10,800
and fixing a lot of bugs right now

01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:14,480
hope scotch is a community of 180

01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,880
000 plus users and the ui and the app

01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:18,080
has

01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:21,120
improved lot more and this is

01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:23,840
the current hopes calculation with

01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:25,520
lot of features from the initial version

01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:29,840
you can test your apis

01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:32,960
within two to five seconds and

01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:35,679
response can be like found here

01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:37,360
apart from testing restful apis you can

01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:40,880
even test graphql

01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:44,000
real-time api such as web socket ssc

01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:47,040
you can even generate api documentation

01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:51,120
and the whole uh hopes coach testing

01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:54,719
ecosystem consists of a cli client

01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:57,520
uh two web browser extensions

01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:59,920
a proxy middleware servers and a lot of

01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:03,040
lot of other projects as well

01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:04,159
so this is the initial chaining of

01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:07,199
hopscotch

01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:09,920
and uh right now we are at a good

01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:10,840
good position where the repository has

01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:14,400
more than

01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:17,040
29 000 plus github stars with all

01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:19,280
120 plus contributors from around the

01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,280
world

01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:24,080
so this is the post which kind of went

01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:28,080
viral

01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:31,280
and had almost over 132

01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:34,239
000 plus page views on devdo 2.

01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:35,920
this is the single most traffic which i

01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:39,520
got for hospital

01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:41,920
project so what does this

01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:43,360
mean for an ordinary developer like me

01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:45,600
or like you

01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:48,400
is the all traction hope score shot can

01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:51,440
be reproduced for another project

01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:53,280
or how is it possible for a project from

01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,640
india to get this much traction

01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:57,520
worldwide so

01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:58,480
these are some of my observations that i

01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:00,640
made from

01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,600
building hopscotch project which might

01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,560
help you to

01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,960
build the next best open source project

01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,560
so

01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,000
the first thing starts with the

01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:10,480
realization that

01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,280
progress takes time it might happen

01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:14,239
overnight

01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:14,640
but the mindset should be progress

01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:18,239
should

01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:21,199
take at least a limited period of time

01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:22,640
for the project to get to a mature state

01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:25,840
it might be one week

01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:29,199
one month six months or hour and year

01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:32,239
so the mindset is very important that

01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:33,199
progress is a gradual process and the

01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:37,040
second thing i

01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:40,000
i really keen to do is i always

01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:41,120
try to solve a single problem faced by

01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,320
myself

01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:47,600
and this this very reason is

01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:50,719
why i started the project hopscotch

01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:51,360
i was facing an issue or a problem which

01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:54,080
is

01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:54,719
there there was no api testing tools

01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:57,679
works for

01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:58,880
web web platform and i made that

01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:02,000
solution

01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:04,480
and at first i was the only user but as

01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,600
soon as i started sharing it with

01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:10,719
more my friends i started to realize the

01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:13,040
app requires more essential features and

01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:14,239
a lot of refactoring that need to be

01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:17,199
done so

01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:18,080
always start with one problem and solve

01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:21,440
that solution

01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:23,600
for one user and scale upwards

01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,719
and the other thing which is the most

01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,280
important of all

01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:28,960
is being consistent with your project

01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:31,920
never let your dependencies

01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:32,880
go out of date always keep your

01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:36,000
repository

01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:39,520
up to date accept contributions

01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:42,800
reply to your issues or pull requests

01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:45,600
as soon as possible so that is how

01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,640
and why you should keep your

01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:50,080
repositories

01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:53,120
consistent and next thing is

01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:55,920
always keep your community engaged

01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:56,719
for hopscotch we have two very active

01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,960
communities

01:13:56,719 --> 01:14:01,280
one is a discord server and the other is

01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:04,320
a telegram public group

01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:05,840
we always discuss our upcoming futures

01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:09,520
with the community members

01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:12,880
and get feedbacks on uh how to do it or

01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:15,360
if we encounter a bug which is

01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,920
uh you know affecting a lot of usage we

01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,920
always

01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:19,199
ask for the community members on

01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:21,600
feedbacks

01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:23,360
also you should try to promote your

01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:26,080
project very often

01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:28,400
this can be done in lot of ways but from

01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:30,960
my personal experience i believe

01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:32,880
documenting your project uh whether

01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:36,159
through a blog or a

01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:37,040
github read me everything works i wrote

01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:40,320
a blog

01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:40,719
and document your progress is the single

01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:43,440
most

01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:44,719
best way to promote your project share

01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:47,040
your obstacles

01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:49,120
share how you solve them there are

01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,600
developers who are eagerly waiting to

01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:53,360
see

01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:56,560
how you did that and the next thing is

01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:59,040
well the project consists of me

01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:00,320
and one of my partner andrew bastian who

01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:03,360
lives in canada

01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:06,480
we are the core developers and we always

01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:08,480
ask others for help i am a friend and

01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:10,719
person and my partner is like back

01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:13,199
back in person everything related to

01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:16,080
backhand is single-handedly done by him

01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:16,719
and with the help of the community i and

01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:19,120
him

01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:20,239
always ask for feedbacks and help from

01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:23,440
the community

01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:25,440
and we are always keen to do it so this

01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:26,560
always help us to keep the community

01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:28,880
engaged

01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:31,600
and this this results in the betterment

01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,600
of the project

01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:36,960
so even though if you could scale a

01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:40,640
project to a lot of uses

01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:42,800
how can you make a project sustained so

01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:43,679
sustainability of an open source project

01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,400
with which has

01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:48,159
lot of parameters in which the finance

01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:51,360
or the monetization part

01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:53,920
plays a crucial role in hopscotch

01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:54,480
we find a lot of ways to monetize our

01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:57,520
project

01:15:54,480 --> 01:16:00,800
and these are the most super simple ways

01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:02,960
on how everyone can find a way to

01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:05,760
monetize their own open source project

01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,000
you know building a recurring revenue

01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:08,239
for

01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,120
your operations project so the first one

01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:12,080
which is the most

01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:14,800
obvious one accepting sponsorships and

01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:16,960
donations from your potential users

01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:19,520
every open source project has this

01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:23,360
philosophy of gratitude behind it

01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:24,159
the users are agreed to show the

01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:26,480
gratitude

01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:27,600
in terms of financial support as well

01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:29,520
and to do it

01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,679
there are a lot of projects github

01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:34,800
sponsors open collective are doing

01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:37,760
extraordinary things to do so i

01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,480
i advise everyone to add a sponsorship

01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,080
button

01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:41,920
to your repositories and even

01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:45,280
organizations

01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:46,159
the second most one is self-hosted

01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:49,280
instances

01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:52,640
so after evaluating our traffic

01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:54,080
we realized that our 48 percentage of

01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:57,120
traffic were coming from

01:16:54,080 --> 01:17:00,480
developer communities in countries like

01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:02,080
china singapore even from india and

01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,760
one thing very peculiar about these

01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:06,080
communities are

01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:07,679
they they prefer a self-hosted instance

01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:09,760
rather than a public domain

01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:10,719
and obviously there are a lot of reasons

01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:13,440
for this like

01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:16,239
bandwidth issues and all but you can

01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:17,920
actually find a monetization plan on

01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:21,199
self-hosting you are on open source

01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:24,640
project if it is self-hostable project

01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:27,199
do provide guidelines on how to do it

01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:28,960
and if someone is having trouble with

01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:32,400
self-hosting your project

01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:34,560
help them and accept a fee for that

01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:36,000
so that is about how self-hosting your

01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:38,159
projects

01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,199
and the next thing is being a creator of

01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:42,560
your project

01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:44,719
you are the best one to educate

01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:47,120
how to run your project or how to make

01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:49,199
use of a project for others

01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:51,440
for a project like hopscotch there is

01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:52,080
literally zero friction to get started

01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:55,440
with

01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:58,159
but as the use cases increase or

01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:59,920
if if the uses requires a complex

01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:02,880
functionality or a feature

01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:04,239
they approach us on how to do it we

01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:06,560
either

01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:07,920
show them how to solve it or we solve

01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,640
them by ourselves

01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:12,400
and for that for educating your users on

01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:15,600
how to use your software is

01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:18,480
you can accept a charge

01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:20,239
and the fourth most one is again one of

01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:22,960
the most conventional one

01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:23,600
you can release a feature or a set of

01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:26,880
features

01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:28,880
which comes with a paid plan this works

01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,080
very similar to software to service

01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:34,159
models

01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:36,400
or if your uh expenses server bills are

01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:37,760
more than enough you you should you know

01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:40,960
hope for this

01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:43,360
this way on monetizing start accepting a

01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:45,280
monthly fee or yearly fee for a set of

01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:48,400
features which you think

01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:50,560
should be exclusive for your uses

01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:52,480
and the fifth most one is the most

01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,440
recent and most popular one right now

01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:56,320
because

01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:58,159
it is accepting investments from

01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:00,560
potential investors

01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:03,840
if you or your team can convince a

01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:06,719
potential investor or an angel fund

01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:08,960
on you know realizing a revenue model or

01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:11,040
a business model in the near future

01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:13,520
there are a lot of angel investors who

01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:16,320
are looking to fund open source project

01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:17,280
so keep a pitch check with your project

01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:20,640
and

01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:22,960
ask for investors on uh potential plans

01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:27,199
or collaborations

01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:29,199
moving on so even though if you are able

01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:31,280
to sustain your project

01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:33,199
how can you even make an open source

01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:35,199
developer tools

01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:37,199
if you look at the current proprietary

01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:39,360
services

01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:40,239
if you look at every of them you can

01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:43,199
actually find

01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:45,679
that every property service use at least

01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:48,719
one open source tool or library

01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:49,840
in its core technology in fact there are

01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:52,400
property services

01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:54,000
which make use of 100 percentage open

01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:56,480
source tools

01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,159
so what does this mean for an ordinary

01:19:56,480 --> 01:20:01,120
developer like me or you

01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:02,719
how can you leverage the open source

01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:06,480
community to build

01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:09,280
or make another uh developer tools

01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:11,280
so being a developer this open source

01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:14,159
community is the best part that happened

01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:17,760
to me to build hopscotch project

01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:21,120
so start with a start with identifying a

01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:23,840
single problem faced by a single user

01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,480
then try to solve by introducing a

01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,560
solution

01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:28,800
and this doesn't have to be like rocket

01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:32,000
science a simple workflow

01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:33,920
in your workplace or a simple tool

01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,440
which you think that might have been

01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:38,000
better in

01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:39,520
you know in an another flow if you if

01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,639
you find anything which

01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:46,000
lacks a is find a solution

01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:47,840
and make an mvp even though you built a

01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,560
solution for a single user

01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:51,280
always look for an enterprise level use

01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,600
cases

01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:54,880
so basically enterprises are communities

01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:57,840
of single users

01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:59,440
if one user has an issue the chances are

01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:03,120
there are a lot of users which

01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:05,920
face the same issues share your solution

01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:07,280
where developers or your potential uses

01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:10,639
are hanging out

01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:13,600
subreddits developer forums extras are

01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:15,600
very good examples of or developers

01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:17,360
usually hang out

01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:20,080
so after building an enterprise level

01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:23,840
solution start to monetize your project

01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:26,400
as early as possible again you can use

01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,440
any of of monetization plans that i

01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:30,320
mentioned above

01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:30,800
start with a sponsorship or a donations

01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:34,960
and

01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:35,760
scale upwards so scaling again comes

01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:37,920
with

01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:40,320
uh you know starting with one user

01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:43,360
sharing with 10 of your friends

01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:43,920
and scaling scaling to your 100 plus

01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:47,120
friends

01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:50,320
documenting your progress and all so

01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:53,120
this is how you can exactly build

01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:54,239
and make the next best open source

01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:56,960
developer tools

01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:58,400
with the help of community and hopes

01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,719
coach being a tool

01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:01,760
built by the community and built for the

01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:04,320
community

01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:08,320
we are really proud to accept all these

01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:08,320

hopscotch

01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:28,239
so thanks to github for github and

01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:32,719
partners for this

01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:32,719
opportunity this means a lot to us

01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:39,840
yes

01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:44,320
thanks a lot lias that was that was a

01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:47,120
really interesting session to know about

01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:49,120
uh you know your journey in building

01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:50,400
hopscotch and everything else that you

01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:53,120
have come across

01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:53,840
so all of you tuning in live uh if you

01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:56,719
have any

01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:57,760
questions for vrs drop them over on

01:22:56,719 --> 01:22:59,920
discussions

01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:01,040
on github satellite dot com slash

01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:03,199
discussions and

01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:04,320
we'll be taking up some of them live

01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:06,880
here uh

01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:07,520
for liars uh we already have some

01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,639
questions

01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:13,520
uh you know coming in for julia's

01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:14,080
and um i think the first thing that

01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:16,719
folks

01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:18,000
really want to know is uh how do you

01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:19,920
find motivation to

01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,320
consistently work on an open source

01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:24,560
project

01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,840
okay so this is actually a tricky

01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:28,159
question because

01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:29,120
everybody has their own ways on finding

01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:31,679
motivation

01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:33,760
and how i personally did is i always

01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:34,560
find that motivation is a personal

01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:37,040
choice

01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,600
if i want to do it i will find a way to

01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:40,639
do it

01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:41,040
and if i don't want i will find excuses

01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:44,080
too

01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:46,560
i want that so i believe motivation is a

01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:49,760
choice that you have to make by yourself

01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:51,920
and the way to do is is like the

01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:53,600
example that i mentioned if you are you

01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,719
know if you're like documenting your

01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:57,199
progress

01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:58,480
or sharing the news with your friends or

01:23:57,199 --> 01:24:01,440
your communities

01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:01,760
you will always have this push from them

01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:05,280
to

01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:05,679
deliver much more and that is the single

01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:08,239
most

01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:09,360
reason why i keep you know building all

01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:11,199
those projects

01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:13,920
and motivation is a choice that you have

01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:16,480
to make by yourself

01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,760
great that's perfect so what's the most

01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,719
difficult thing about managing

01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:20,239
contributors

01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:24,560
from different time zones because you

01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:27,920
know they they are located everywhere

01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:31,040
yes uh so as i mentioned the project has

01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:34,080
over 120 plus contributors

01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:36,880
from almost every country though so

01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:37,679
how we did it uh well we kind of like

01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:40,560
leveraged

01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:41,520
that uh you know issues with opposite

01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:45,120
time zones

01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:48,400
to our uh advantage and how we did it

01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:48,960
at any given time either one of us one

01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:51,520
of the

01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,639
contributors will be online and now

01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:55,199
whenever someone

01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:56,320
raises a concern or an issue or a pull

01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:58,560
request

01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:00,159
uh we will immediately respond to it

01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:02,960
because if i am sleeping

01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:04,000
my friend will be you know online at any

01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,960
given time

01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:08,880
and uh we actually leveraged that issue

01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:11,679
to our advantage and uh

01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:13,280
that that alone kept our community very

01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:16,320
engaging

01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:18,800
yeah great

01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:19,760
so uh one other one other kind of like

01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:21,120
uh

01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,880
you know slightly different question

01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:25,840
that's come in is

01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:26,480
uh how do you really see open source

01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:29,679
making an

01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:32,000
impact uh making the world a better

01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:32,000
place

01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:38,239
okay so being an open source developer

01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:39,440
uh well apart from contributing to your

01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:42,000
open source projects

01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:42,480
there are a lot of ways on uh you know

01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,960
how

01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:45,760
how you can make a uh change in the

01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,920
world

01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:49,360
and it doesn't have to be like uh

01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:51,600
writing code

01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:53,280
it can be uh helping your friends in

01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:55,679
need it can be

01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:56,960
you know being a part in the decision

01:25:55,679 --> 01:25:59,920
committee or

01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:00,239
it it can be like very single gestures

01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:03,360
like

01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:06,400
responding to your uh concerns

01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:07,280
raised by your users and all so all

01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:10,320
those little

01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:14,080
small things that we do are exactly what

01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:16,320
makes the a better place

01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:17,199
great uh we've actually got a question

01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,520
coming um

01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:21,440
from adash who's watching watching your

01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:23,760
session live right now which is great

01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:26,880
so adash asks what does it mean to

01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:29,679
self-host projects

01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:32,000
okay so there are a lot of ways on how

01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:35,840
you can self-host your project

01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:39,679
and uh for a web web project or his

01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:42,480
website and if it's a static site

01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:45,360
which hopscotches you can always stick

01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:48,080
to the free plans provided by github

01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:49,040
or static hosting service like netlify

01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:52,159
and all

01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:54,320
and if you have a potential

01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:56,000
customer who would like to have a

01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:58,480
self-hosted version

01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,199
uh you can have a discussion with them

01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:02,080
and

01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:04,239
you know charge a fixed amount for doing

01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:07,120
all those self-hosting process

01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:09,040
which is again one of the best ways on

01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:12,639
how you can monetize your open source

01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:12,639
project if it is self-hostable

01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:17,199
perfect um i've got another question for

01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:20,480
you then

01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:21,920
oh sorry guy oh yes go ahead go ahead

01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:24,239

how they can quickly get started

01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:38,800
okay so being a developer myself i

01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:41,920
always suggest other fellows to

01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:44,639
do three things one is

01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:46,560
get too familiar with at least one

01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:49,679

any language which you are comfortable

01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:57,360
with

01:27:53,760 --> 01:28:00,639
and use github search box to find

01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:01,920
projects that need help always search

01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:04,639

01:28:20,239 --> 01:28:23,679
project

01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:24,560

01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:48,719
learned a lot of new

01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:49,360
things related to front-end technologies

01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:52,320

01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:55,840
like

01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:57,520
graphql and uh yeah during this period

01:34:55,840 --> 01:35:00,719
only i got an opportunity

01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:02,080
from uh magento uh product development

01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:04,400

i live in mumbai in india i started out

01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:57,679
my journey in open source

01:35:54,800 --> 01:36:00,639
with gatsby in fact i had only made

01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:03,760
small contributions to projects i'd used

01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:07,600
before gatsby um somewhere around

01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:10,719
i think december of 2018

01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:14,480
was it is when i started working

01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:15,920
on gatsby as a contractor uh gaster was

01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:19,280
looking for someone to help them

01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:22,960
uh do first touch on github and

01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:24,960
i met jason langstor via a friend and

01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:26,400
you know started working with them a

01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:28,639
couple of months later

01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:29,520
uh you know we both liked working with

01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:32,800
each other i

01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:34,639
decided to join full time and uh

01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:36,159
yeah it's been it's been a pretty solid

01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:39,199
journey i've been helping

01:36:36,159 --> 01:36:40,480
maintain uh gatsby open source um over

01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:42,400
the past two years

01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:44,400
more recently i've been working on

01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:47,199
gatsby cloud which is our

01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:49,199
uh cloud platform to build your gatsby

01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:52,239
apps and you can also host them now

01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:54,000
um so yeah my entire open source journey

01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:58,159
has been with gatsby

01:36:54,000 --> 01:37:00,000
and uh that's how i got started

01:36:58,159 --> 01:37:02,000
it's it's i'm sure it's fun to actually

01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,920
work with a company which is like

01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,520
open source and you are doing open

01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:08,800
source for the full time so

01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:10,400
that's great good to be here yeah so

01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:12,159
before we move ahead like so there is a

01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:13,600
fun fact which i wanted to share with

01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:14,560
you i'm actually related to both the

01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:17,199
cities which

01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:18,080
uh she can't uh see this from so i'm

01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:19,760
from mumbai

01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:21,840
i actually lived in mumbai my entire

01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:25,199
life almost for 29 years

01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:27,679
and i am my family is from uh north up

01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:28,719
so yeah so it's great to connect with

01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:30,239
both of you

01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:31,920
uh so let's move on to the next question

01:37:30,239 --> 01:37:34,000
which we have so uh

01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:35,199
i'm sure you you have been working from

01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,760
uh working with

01:37:35,199 --> 01:37:39,440
in the open source uh for a long time

01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:41,360
now you have been maintaining a

01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:43,600
large open source projects as well so

01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,920
how it has actually impacted your career

01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:46,639
so

01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:48,080
it doesn't help being a maintainer of

01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:50,480
project or contributing to open source

01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:50,480
projects

01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,719
you want to go first

01:37:55,199 --> 01:37:59,840
yeah definitely like for me like working

01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:02,960
over open source is

01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:04,639
more like knowledge sharing and since i

01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:07,360
was working with the

01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:08,400
open source projects with my clients so

01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:11,040
it helped me

01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:11,440
to find out all the things related to

01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:13,679
that

01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:14,960
particular projects which is being

01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:17,760
worked being done

01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:18,560
on and also i'm able to contribute and

01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:20,880
like

01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:22,080
fix issues also involved in the github

01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:24,639
discussions and

01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:26,400
based on that like i i'm very soon i

01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:29,280
started getting recognition

01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:30,880
out of my work so yeah so people

01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:34,080
recognize me for me

01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:34,800
for my work and also i'm able to get to

01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:37,440
know about

01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:38,880
the things which is related to the work

01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:41,920
like i know the places where

01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:45,360
i need to find out and i can easily get

01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:48,480
uh the answer of several um

01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:49,040
questions from the clients and apart

01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:51,760
from this

01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:53,760
also i got feedback for my work from

01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:57,199
highly experienced developers so it's

01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:58,159
really in uh improved me for enhancing

01:38:57,199 --> 01:39:00,639
my

01:38:58,159 --> 01:39:01,440
skills and knowledge so yeah it's

01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:05,040
definitely

01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:07,440
like helping me very much grow in my

01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:07,440
career

01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:14,320
what about you sir it's been great um

01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:16,960
i think there's been two parts to it one

01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:18,800
is the fact that working on now gatsby

01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:19,520
is a is a pretty huge project right we

01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:21,040
have

01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:22,719
i i don't remember the numbers of the

01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:26,960
top my head but i think roughly about

01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:29,760
400 000 downloads weekly um

01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:31,040
now that's a lot of scale and that's a

01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:33,360
lot of users

01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:35,840
and uh on such a large project there's

01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:36,719
always a lot of nuance and complexity

01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:38,639
right and there's

01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:40,080
and there's issues you kind of see that

01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:41,600
that you wouldn't normally hit on a

01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:43,280
day-to-day basis

01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:44,719
that's been something that's helped me

01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:47,920
level up tremendously

01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:48,320
as as a dev um and besides that working

01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:51,040
in

01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:52,320
the open working in public in open

01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:54,320
source is great because

01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:56,000
it's really helped me sort of build a

01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:59,040
presence and also build

01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:01,840
um you know stuff to be able to show off

01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:02,639
um on github so i think i think that's

01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:06,320
been pretty

01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:07,360
solid for my career oh that's that's

01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:08,800
great i

01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:10,560
really agree with that because i have

01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:12,480
been doing open source from last

01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:14,639
one and a half year no no more than two

01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:16,000
years and i can see the kind of impact

01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:19,040
it has on my career so

01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,639
i agree with both of you uh now

01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:22,159
next let's move on to the next question

01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:23,040
i'm sure there are a lot of new

01:40:22,159 --> 01:40:24,480
developers and

01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:26,400
we have just seen the stats and i'm

01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:27,760
really excited i mean india is one of

01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:29,520
the growing countries

01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:31,119
in terms of open source contribution

01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:33,760
million developers added

01:40:31,119 --> 01:40:35,040
uh in last one year and i'm hoping for

01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:38,800
uh next 10 million

01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:40,800
soon so how or what are your suggestions

01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:43,920
uh to the nift developers who wants to

01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:47,360
start contributing to open source

01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:51,920
so uh shikha want to take the sage first

01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:55,360
ah yeah uh like for new developers like

01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:55,760
i would suggest them to uh like just go

01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:58,800
for

01:40:55,760 --> 01:41:00,880
any open source like if they want to uh

01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:03,040
like have a graph like they are just

01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:05,119
graduating and they want to

01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:06,800
join any product development companies

01:41:05,119 --> 01:41:09,199
or something like somewhere i have

01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:10,239
read about that like if you have some

01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:13,040
background in

01:41:10,239 --> 01:41:14,000
open source working then there are more

01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:16,800
chances to get

01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,679
in uh in a big product development

01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:19,760
companies

01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:21,840
i have read it somewhere so basically

01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:24,000
for that is also very helpful to

01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:25,280
increase their improve their skills and

01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,639
also the code

01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:30,880
you write on open source github like

01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:33,520
repositories then that will be exposed

01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:35,760
to everyone so you more focus on your

01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:38,800
work so it definitely it is going to

01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:41,280
improve your skills so for

01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:42,480
like basically they should just they

01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:44,800
should not rush

01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:45,679
about doing the contribution they should

01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:48,719
just go

01:41:45,679 --> 01:41:50,400
slightly and they just uh i would

01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:51,760
suggest them to read out all the

01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:53,840
comments on the previous

01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:56,159
pull requests and issues like just

01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:58,400
involving the discussions first

01:41:56,159 --> 01:42:00,000
and then they will learn the patterns

01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:03,199
over working on that

01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,080
and also like just not go for the code

01:42:03,199 --> 01:42:06,800
contribution

01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:08,159
also go for the documentations that is

01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:10,880
also very helpful

01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:11,840
uh part for any devs and they will also

01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:14,000
like uh

01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:16,080
realize it very soon whenever they will

01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:19,199
expose to real industries

01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:20,320
so yeah i would suggest them to be uh

01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:22,800
like uh

01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:23,679
go slowly don't flush and be consistent

01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:27,280
with whatever

01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:30,719
they are doing yes all my discussion

01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:32,560
like for this suggestion for this

01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:34,639
correct tips uh what about you said i'm

01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:37,679
i'm i have seen gatsby actually

01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:39,119
uh gets get a very close with the

01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:41,119
developers or the developer community

01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:42,080
which is out there and they have helped

01:42:41,119 --> 01:42:44,400
i think many

01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:45,119
developers to start contributing to open

01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,719
source so i would

01:42:45,119 --> 01:42:48,480
i would love to hear from you how you do

01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:50,000
that how you how

01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:52,880
i mean what are the tips you share with

01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:56,080
the new developers

01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:58,880
yeah that's a great question so um

01:42:56,080 --> 01:43:00,719
here's what i here's what i think um the

01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:02,719
the best way to start contributing

01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:04,080
is to contribute to a project that you

01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:07,199
use frequently

01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:08,560
um if you're using any project in either

01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:11,199
your day-to-day work or

01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:12,719
on a site project and you you know you

01:43:11,199 --> 01:43:15,040
happen to hit a bug

01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:15,920
uh maybe that's a great place to start

01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:18,239
you know try to

01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:19,040
create a small reproduction open an

01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:21,440
issue

01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:22,639
see if you can fix the bug yourself open

01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:25,920
a pull request

01:43:22,639 --> 01:43:27,920
um or even if it isn't a bug often we we

01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:29,600
um you know we read documentation

01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:32,159
something is unclear

01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:32,639
uh you're not sure exactly what you know

01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:35,119
a certain

01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:37,440
api looks like maybe a great place to

01:43:35,119 --> 01:43:39,360
start is to improve that documentation

01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:41,040
and uh you know talking about gatsby

01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:43,920
with gatsby uh

01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:44,480
our contributions have been fantastic i

01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:47,440
mean

01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:48,719
gatsby is what it is in a huge part

01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:51,520
because of the community

01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:52,960
we've had over 2000 if i recall

01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:56,800
correctly contributors

01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:57,440
uh over time and uh if you'd like to get

01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:59,840
started

01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:00,719
with gatsby itself we have a ton of open

01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:03,920
issues

01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:05,600
um i'm always happy to help and point

01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:06,880
you in the right direction you can reach

01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:10,000
out to me on twitter

01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:11,679
um we also have a gatsby discord which

01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:14,159
is a great place for people to

01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:15,119
you know just get their feet wet and uh

01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:16,880
get started

01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:18,840
you can you can find a link on on our

01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:21,840
website um

01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:22,560
yeah uh you know and no no contribution

01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:25,119
is too

01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:26,239
small so even if it's a typo even if

01:44:25,119 --> 01:44:28,239
it's something

01:44:26,239 --> 01:44:30,159
you know fairly minor that's still

01:44:28,239 --> 01:44:30,719
valuable so it's always good to start

01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:34,239
from

01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:36,480
from anything really i agree totally

01:44:34,239 --> 01:44:39,119
agreed because i started my contribution

01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:40,560
uh in angular with documentation and it

01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:42,960
never mattered how small

01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:45,199
that pr is but actually open source

01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:46,400
community uh welcomes or appreciates

01:44:45,199 --> 01:44:48,800
each and every pr

01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:50,080
so in case you want to get started with

01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:51,199
open source contribution

01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:52,800
just go ahead and get in touch with

01:44:51,199 --> 01:44:54,320
siddharth and they will get they will

01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:55,760
help you

01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:57,520
now let's move on to the next question

01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:58,320
which is more on the terms of

01:44:57,520 --> 01:45:00,400
maintainers

01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:01,920
because there are really uh there if you

01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:03,760
go to open source there are a lot of

01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:05,840
consumers rather than the

01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:07,360
people who are actually helping the open

01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:08,560
source community and maintainers are

01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:12,080
actually one of the

01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:12,960
important part of that entire ecosystem

01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:15,760
i would say

01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:17,600
so what are your suggestions to new

01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:21,840
maintainers of an open source projects

01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:21,840
i mean when they represent a community

01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,600
so see that you want to go first yeah

01:45:27,119 --> 01:45:31,199
sure

01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:32,639
sure um i think uh

01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:34,239
firstly that's a great question thank

01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:36,960
you for asking that um

01:45:34,239 --> 01:45:37,360
i think uh you know my only advice would

01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:41,040
be

01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:43,840
uh be kind be inclusive and have empathy

01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:45,119
um i think a lot of users when they

01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:47,600
stumble upon your project

01:45:45,119 --> 01:45:48,239
might not have as much context as you do

01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,560
and

01:45:48,239 --> 01:45:52,239
you know something might seem unclear

01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:54,000
often issues

01:45:52,239 --> 01:45:55,679
aren't as detailed as you'd like them to

01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:57,840
be but

01:45:55,679 --> 01:45:59,280
it's always it's always a good idea in

01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:01,920
my opinion to be inclusive

01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:03,440
ask the right questions um and you know

01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:04,880
try to foster that that sort of

01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:07,520
community

01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:09,280
besides that i think um a couple of

01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:11,679
things on github right i think

01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:13,600
issue templates are a great way to help

01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:16,080
point people in the right direction

01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:16,800
um having you know maybe a discord

01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:20,000
channel

01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:22,239
uh to be able to talk to folks who uh

01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:24,560
are trying to contribute is something

01:46:22,239 --> 01:46:26,719
that has been very helpful for gatsby

01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:27,760
and i can see a lot of maintainers uh

01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:30,239
you know uh

01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:32,000
being able to take sort of uh being able

01:46:30,239 --> 01:46:35,360
to you know benefit from that

01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:37,679
um and finally i think labeling is is a

01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:38,719
is a really helpful thing to do right

01:46:37,679 --> 01:46:41,360
github has

01:46:38,719 --> 01:46:42,000
a couple of uh labels like good first

01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:44,000
issue

01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,840
that um show up even if you know you

01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,760
search for a project or

01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:50,000
or if you search for good first issues

01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:51,040
so if you if you identify issues in your

01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:54,159
project that you

01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:54,719
think um are you know a good starting

01:46:54,159 --> 01:46:57,040
point

01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:58,080
for new contributors as a maintainer

01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:59,679
labeling them

01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:01,360
uh you know uh editing their

01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:02,159
descriptions for those to be really

01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:04,320
clear

01:47:02,159 --> 01:47:05,280
uh these are things that really help you

01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,960
scale

01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:08,560
you know your project as a maintainer

01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:11,040
and help you invite

01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:12,480
the right kind of contributions um so

01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:13,679
that's what i would recommend be

01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:16,560
inclusive

01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:19,360
and uh you know edit your issues write

01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:23,119
them well label them

01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:25,360
that's great tips what about you

01:47:23,119 --> 01:47:26,239
yeah i completely agree with said like

01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:28,239
whatever he

01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:30,400
was suggesting like to have uh issue

01:47:28,239 --> 01:47:33,040
templates and labeling and also

01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:33,760
editing the issue description basically

01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:36,880
uh for

01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:39,280
magento itself like we also like

01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:40,480
there are little templates for issues

01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:43,119
and also

01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:44,320
uh like you can also add the good first

01:47:43,119 --> 01:47:46,560
issues based on

01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:47,520
if they are contributing for the first

01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:49,679
time

01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:50,719
i would also like to add some things

01:47:49,679 --> 01:47:52,880
like if you

01:47:50,719 --> 01:47:54,080
are a maintainer and you are reviewing

01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:56,400
so like that's

01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:57,679
the thing like there are some little

01:47:56,400 --> 01:48:00,560
mistakes like there is

01:47:57,679 --> 01:48:01,280
just changes in one line and one file

01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:04,639
and you just

01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:05,600
uh approve it witho without checking all

01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:07,600
the

01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:09,360
automation test is passed so like

01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:12,560
sometimes it happens like

01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:14,800
the the test is not actually passed so

01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:16,639
be uh make sure that you are checking

01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:17,679
all the things before approving the pull

01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:20,000
request

01:48:17,679 --> 01:48:21,280
also i would suggest that like some time

01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,760
i've seen that

01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:25,040
like some people some maintainers or

01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:27,440
whatever like

01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:28,320
in some cases like we are adding some

01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:30,560
comments for

01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:32,000
the contributor and we are not available

01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:34,400
there to answer their

01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,360
questions over that is coming out of our

01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:38,159
comments

01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:39,119
so be make sure that you are available

01:48:38,159 --> 01:48:43,440
on time to

01:48:39,119 --> 01:48:45,199
uh have uh like answer the contributors

01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:48,639
questions as well

01:48:45,199 --> 01:48:51,840
and being a maintainer i would like it's

01:48:48,639 --> 01:48:53,520
not it's like it's not required to

01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:55,600
have the knowledge of each and every

01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:58,800
sections you are checking and

01:48:55,600 --> 01:49:01,679
contributor is working so make sure like

01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:03,520
if there is possibility to have like you

01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:07,040
can ask for discussion

01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:10,560
and views from other maintainers so just

01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:13,440
try to initiate the discussion for that

01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:14,880
for other maintainers views as well so

01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:16,880
that the only

01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:19,040
the perfect solution should be delivered

01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:24,719
to the main branches

01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:26,639
and yeah that's all for my point of view

01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:28,639
so the next question is really important

01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:29,760
to everyone who is involved in open

01:49:28,639 --> 01:49:31,920
source or even not

01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:33,440
involved in open source right so how to

01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:35,440
stay away from burnout so

01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:37,440
i'm sure it happens to everyone and you

01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:39,599
may have been in the same scenario so

01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:42,320
uh if you can share your stories and how

01:49:39,599 --> 01:49:43,920
you you were able to actually uh stay

01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:44,719
away from burnout how you disconnected

01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:46,639
yourself so

01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:48,080
i'll be happy to actually hear your

01:49:46,639 --> 01:49:51,280
experiences so

01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:51,280
that's it you want to go first

01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:57,280
yeah sure so that's a great question um

01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:59,599
i mean burnout is is

01:49:57,280 --> 01:50:00,320
inevitable i think to to a certain

01:49:59,599 --> 01:50:02,480
extent

01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:03,440
um and it happens to everybody it's

01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:05,280
happened to me

01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:06,960
um i'm sure it's happened to you all as

01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:09,520
well i think uh

01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:10,639
what's really important is is work-life

01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,360
balance right i think we take for

01:50:10,639 --> 01:50:14,000
granted

01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:16,000
that especially with the pandemic it's

01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:18,000
easy to get lost in your work and

01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:20,080
spend too much time working and not you

01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:22,320
know taking time out to do things that

01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:25,040
you really enjoy

01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:26,960
even if you really enjoy coding and you

01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:28,719
know you want to do that outside of work

01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:31,599
i still recommend

01:50:28,719 --> 01:50:32,080
uh trying to take time away from you

01:50:31,599 --> 01:50:34,800
know

01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:35,199
screens go out you know get some fresh

01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:38,560
air

01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:40,880
um and and uh you know find hobbies

01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:42,080
that uh don't have to do with a computer

01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:44,320
i think that sort of balance

01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:45,520
really helps uh one of you know the

01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:48,080
things i do is

01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:49,679
is i i like diving so i i you know

01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:52,080
travel whenever i can

01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:53,040
uh in fact i'm i'm doing that right now

01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:55,280
so uh

01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:56,719
yeah you know try to find some solid

01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:59,679
work life balance

01:50:56,719 --> 01:51:02,400
uh maintain boundaries take time off

01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:06,239
regularly for yourself to recuperate

01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:07,520
and uh don't work weekends

01:51:06,239 --> 01:51:09,280
that's something that i see a lot of

01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:12,159
people doing

01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:13,199
early in their career and i would not

01:51:12,159 --> 01:51:16,080
recommend it

01:51:13,199 --> 01:51:16,080
don't work weekends

01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:23,760
so what about yusika what

01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:25,040
yeah i completely agree with said

01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:28,080
because like uh

01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:30,000
there is uh like and during this

01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:31,280
lockdown period especially there are a

01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:34,639
lot of chances to have

01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:38,159
stress over the work and uh like

01:51:34,639 --> 01:51:38,960
what i do like i do to prioritize my

01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:41,840
work

01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:42,800
first so that like i am not working on

01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:46,080
uh on

01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:48,639
less important uh task very much

01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:49,920
so the prioritization is helping me out

01:51:48,639 --> 01:51:52,719
uh very much

01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:53,599
and uh apart from this uh like that's

01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:56,960
the said said

01:51:53,599 --> 01:52:00,000
like uh uh taking periodically

01:51:56,960 --> 01:52:02,320
time off from your screen time and

01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,440
just go involved in some other

01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:05,920
activities

01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:06,719
that is also helping us like helping

01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:10,480
everyone

01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:13,119
a lot to avoid this stress

01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:14,960
and apart from this like if if you are

01:52:13,119 --> 01:52:16,880
working on certain tasks and you have to

01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:20,000
achieve some milestone in your work

01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:20,800
so if it is required to do extra efforts

01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,920
and

01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:24,480
take extra stress and be focused on that

01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:26,320
so

01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:29,040
in that case like i would suggest to

01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:32,880
find out the motivation out of your work

01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:34,960
time to uh get note down all the uh

01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:36,400
benefits and learnings you are getting

01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:39,360
through that work

01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:41,280
so in that case like if you are working

01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:44,719
hard and working

01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:46,800
too much and with very stress so in that

01:52:44,719 --> 01:52:48,400
in that situation also you find the

01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:50,080
motivation to work and

01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:52,639
i really feel that if you are really

01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:55,360
motivated and passionate about your work

01:52:52,639 --> 01:52:56,639
there are less chances that you will get

01:52:55,360 --> 01:53:00,320
stressed out

01:52:56,639 --> 01:53:03,760
uh out of your work so that's the thing

01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:04,639
that's the thing to avoid your stress at

01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:07,920
your

01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:07,920
uh professional life

01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:12,159
well that's great so thanks for sharing

01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:13,840
the tips so now next question which i

01:53:12,159 --> 01:53:16,000
have is

01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:16,960
uh everyone has their own motivation

01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,040
right so

01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:21,199
whenever they do something so what your

01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:23,040
motivation what drives you towards the

01:53:21,199 --> 01:53:24,840
open source country or doing open source

01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:27,840
contribution or maintaining the

01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:27,840
community

01:53:38,159 --> 01:53:43,679
the motivation is to uh just come

01:53:41,199 --> 01:53:45,760
for me the motivation is to gather the

01:53:43,679 --> 01:53:47,440
knowledge and share your knowledge

01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:49,920
like it's a great feeling if you are

01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:52,560
able to help others community

01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:54,639
and be involved in that and you can be

01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:57,840
recognized for your work so

01:53:54,639 --> 01:54:00,719
the main motivation for me is to

01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:02,719
uh like you can have the expert on

01:54:00,719 --> 01:54:05,360
opinion on your

01:54:02,719 --> 01:54:06,000
working and also you can improve your

01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:07,760
skills

01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,199
you can be involved in several

01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:12,400
discussion and there

01:54:09,199 --> 01:54:15,520
your uh your like uh

01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:16,239
suggestion might be matter almost maybe

01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:18,000
there are

01:54:16,239 --> 01:54:19,280
some chances like your suggestion will

01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,920
be counted as

01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:24,080
one of the best suggestion and that can

01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:26,880
be implemented in a way

01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:28,960
and if even if you are working in a big

01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:30,159
organization they are also including

01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:33,199
your thoughts

01:54:30,159 --> 01:54:36,000
in their product so it's a great uh

01:54:33,199 --> 01:54:38,080
feeling of achievement for me like if

01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:40,880
you are being recognized for your work

01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:42,880
so knowledge sharing is the most uh

01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:45,920
motivation for me

01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:47,360
for working on open source like i can be

01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:50,800
involved in the discussions

01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:53,920
and also i can learn a lot from

01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:55,679
their experiences oh that's right

01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:57,760
so what about using what's what's your

01:54:55,679 --> 01:55:00,320
motivation

01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:02,639
my motivation is that i get paid for it

01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:05,599
uh i'm kidding

01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:06,560
but i think i think i'm half kidding um

01:55:05,599 --> 01:55:08,239
the other thing that

01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:09,840
i mean the thing i like the most about

01:55:08,239 --> 01:55:12,560
open source on serious note

01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:14,960
is that there's the sort of scale in

01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:17,520
open source projects that's hard to find

01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:18,639
in day-to-day product development i mean

01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:21,920
unless you're working on

01:55:18,639 --> 01:55:22,800
a really large project or a really large

01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:25,199
product like

01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:26,800
maybe twitter or facebook it's likely

01:55:25,199 --> 01:55:28,960
that your open source

01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:30,960
project will probably see more users

01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:32,159
than you know the product you're using

01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:35,360
it for maybe

01:55:32,159 --> 01:55:38,159
um and that kind of scale

01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:39,119
brings a really different class of

01:55:38,159 --> 01:55:40,320
problems

01:55:39,119 --> 01:55:42,239
and a really different class of

01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:44,159
complexity um

01:55:42,239 --> 01:55:46,320
i've really been enjoying that at gatsby

01:55:44,159 --> 01:55:49,040
it's hard but it's also

01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:49,920
uh it's hard to solve you know difficult

01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:52,239
problems

01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:53,040
um i've i've noticed that that's driven

01:55:52,239 --> 01:55:55,760
me uh

01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:56,320
another thing that's driven me has just

01:55:55,760 --> 01:56:00,080
been

01:55:56,320 --> 01:56:03,360
uh you know open sources is really

01:56:00,080 --> 01:56:04,800
um is really satisfying in the fact that

01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:05,679
you know when you see other people being

01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:08,400
able to create

01:56:05,679 --> 01:56:08,800
real value from from your work i think

01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:10,960
it's

01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:12,880
it's a huge multiplier in terms of how

01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:15,199
much of an impact you can have right

01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:16,480
uh versus you know building one product

01:56:15,199 --> 01:56:19,040
or building

01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:19,840
something that's used in you know many

01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:22,719
products

01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:24,800
um that's that's really you know been

01:56:22,719 --> 01:56:27,440
driving me at gatsby seeing all the

01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:28,560
fantastic projects people create with it

01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:31,360
so um

01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:34,080
so yeah that's what's uh that's what's

01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:35,920
driven me so far

01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:38,000
so let's move on to our last question

01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:39,760
for the day so uh

01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:41,599

02:02:11,679 --> 02:02:15,520
myself

02:02:12,400 --> 02:02:18,239

02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:20,239
building a personal project of mine a

02:02:18,239 --> 02:02:21,679
simple resume builder called reactive

02:02:20,239 --> 02:02:23,679

decoding how i got lucky

02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:28,960
and hoping that this journey of mine

02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:31,440
would help you in your product

02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:33,360
development as well

02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:35,800
i only have one simple idea to share

02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:38,880
with you today and that's

02:02:35,800 --> 02:02:40,159
internationalization i could end this

02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:42,480
talk right here right now

02:02:40,159 --> 02:02:43,199
for those who already know what that is

02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:45,040

i'm going to talk about how i

02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:52,480
implemented i89 in my project

02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:54,560
how it helped me in increasing

02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:55,599
collaboration amongst other open source

02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:57,840
devs and

02:02:55,599 --> 02:02:59,520

02:02:57,840 --> 02:03:02,639
goals much faster than i

02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:03,199
expected finally i'll also be talking

02:03:02,639 --> 02:03:05,920
about

02:03:03,199 --> 02:03:06,719
how you can adopt iet n into your apps

02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:08,320

02:03:06,719 --> 02:03:10,719
and also some tools to help you in the

02:03:08,320 --> 02:03:13,280
process

02:03:10,719 --> 02:03:15,520
cool so let's head on over to the link

02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:18,800
on the screen

02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:19,119
this is rx residue.me and i'm going to

02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:22,639
be

02:03:19,119 --> 02:03:24,400
logging in right now into the app

02:03:22,639 --> 02:03:27,840
on this screen you can create multiple

02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:29,520
resumes depending on your job profile

02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:31,760
clicking on your resume you're taken to

02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:33,440
the resume builder and

02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:36,800
while you're on the screen you can edit

02:03:33,440 --> 02:03:36,800
stuff like your name

02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:42,880
and you can see watch it instantly

02:03:41,599 --> 02:03:46,320
change

02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:48,480
in the preview on the left side you can

02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:50,239
edit a bunch of sections and on the

02:03:48,480 --> 02:03:53,520
right you can

02:03:50,239 --> 02:03:55,360
change layouts organize

02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:57,199
your layout you can switch between

02:03:55,360 --> 02:04:00,639
templates organize layouts

02:03:57,199 --> 02:04:04,079
uh you can change colors even for fonts

02:04:00,639 --> 02:04:06,560
or a lot of other things you can even

02:04:04,079 --> 02:04:09,119
export your resume as a pdf

02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:10,560
or you can share a url with anyone who

02:04:09,119 --> 02:04:11,599
would want the latest copy of your

02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:14,239
resume

02:04:11,599 --> 02:04:15,040
but all that's great the crux of today's

02:04:14,239 --> 02:04:18,800
conversation

02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:21,119
is right here languages reactive resume

02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:22,880
is currently available in 26 different

02:04:21,119 --> 02:04:25,360
languages and counting

02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:26,639
i can simply switch to a language like

02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:28,400
let's say german

02:04:26,639 --> 02:04:29,840
and it would change the interface

02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:31,760
completely and

02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:33,840
also certain tokens used within the

02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:36,639
resume

02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:38,320
well now that you've seen the app a

02:04:36,639 --> 02:04:39,920
question that you might have popped into

02:04:38,320 --> 02:04:42,400
your mind would have been

02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:44,320
you know what was your what motivated

02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:45,520
you to add multiple language support in

02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:47,599
the first place

02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:49,360
or on the other hand if you didn't have

02:04:47,599 --> 02:04:52,480
has that question

02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:56,239
here's the answer to it anyway uh

02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:59,199
well it was purely accidental

02:04:56,239 --> 02:05:01,280
i added support for i18n to just allow

02:04:59,199 --> 02:05:02,079
the people around me to be able to use

02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:04,000
it

02:05:02,079 --> 02:05:06,960
in languages like kannada and tamil for

02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:09,920
which i could translate on my own

02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:11,920
with the help of my friends it was used

02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:13,920
by a few people here locally but

02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:15,679
once it got a bit of traction on sites

02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:17,440
like reddit or hacker news

02:05:15,679 --> 02:05:19,199
that's when a lot of users as well

02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:21,679
chimed in and added translations for

02:05:19,199 --> 02:05:23,840
their own languages

02:05:21,679 --> 02:05:26,079
all that's great but what was it good

02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:28,000
for having added all these languages or

02:05:26,079 --> 02:05:29,840
even more having to develop the

02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,400
architecture to be able to translate the

02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:33,840
app

02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:37,119
because it wasn't easy for one

02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:39,280
increase collaboration i never expected

02:05:37,119 --> 02:05:40,719
that i'd be working alongside so many

02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:42,800
amazing developers

02:05:40,719 --> 02:05:44,560
and translators who contributed to

02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:47,280
reactive resume

02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:48,239
this increased the overall participation

02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:50,960
for this project

02:05:48,239 --> 02:05:51,760
on github and was a contributing factor

02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:53,840
to why

02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:56,000
this particular repository received so

02:05:53,840 --> 02:05:59,599
much traffic

02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:01,920
secondly positive conversions now

02:05:59,599 --> 02:06:03,840
if this project had some kind of premium

02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:05,679
model i could tell you how this helped

02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:08,560
me in making a lot of money

02:06:05,679 --> 02:06:09,840
but sadly it had none of these things

02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:12,480
since reactive resume

02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:13,440
is a non-profit project i only measured

02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:16,159
conversions

02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:17,119
by analyzing how many people are talking

02:06:16,159 --> 02:06:19,119
about the project

02:06:17,119 --> 02:06:20,639
and thus spreading the word to those who

02:06:19,119 --> 02:06:23,040
need it the most

02:06:20,639 --> 02:06:24,560
for this i often head to twitter to see

02:06:23,040 --> 02:06:27,840
what people are saying and

02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:30,000
it's been good things so flash

02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:31,599
some other key takeaways from this

02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:34,560
journey were finding out

02:06:31,599 --> 02:06:36,719
more about my domain because now i had

02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:40,400
to cater to a larger audience

02:06:36,719 --> 02:06:42,239
one specific example to this is that

02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:44,480
when i started having people translate

02:06:42,239 --> 02:06:45,920
the app to european languages like

02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:47,360
german or french

02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:49,040
people from these regions were

02:06:47,360 --> 02:06:50,480
requesting for a special type of

02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:53,119
template called europass

02:06:50,480 --> 02:06:54,800
which is widely used there this is

02:06:53,119 --> 02:06:57,199
something i would have never known about

02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:59,119
if it weren't for them

02:06:57,199 --> 02:07:01,440
it also helped me in increasing

02:06:59,119 --> 02:07:03,760
accessibility in the product overall

02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:05,440
i was inclined to use icons in place of

02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:07,440
text more often than not

02:07:05,440 --> 02:07:08,719
so that translators wouldn't have to

02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:12,320
work too hard to

02:07:08,719 --> 02:07:15,440
convert every phrase into their language

02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:17,760
this also made it use possible for users

02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:19,119
of advanced stages or non-english

02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:21,199
speaking natives

02:07:19,119 --> 02:07:22,320
to navigate the user interface without

02:07:21,199 --> 02:07:25,599
any aid

02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:28,880
a small example of this is that

02:07:25,599 --> 02:07:31,119
i've developed many projects before but

02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:33,280
when i showed reactive resume to my dad

02:07:31,119 --> 02:07:35,119
who is a native tamil speaker

02:07:33,280 --> 02:07:37,440
he was able to use it just like how i

02:07:35,119 --> 02:07:39,520
imagined anybody else to be using it

02:07:37,440 --> 02:07:40,560
soon enough he was sharing the link to

02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:42,800
the project with his

02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:43,679
friends and family on various whatsapp

02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:46,639
groups as

02:07:43,679 --> 02:07:48,480
more stats do and this turned into a

02:07:46,639 --> 02:07:50,000
viral marketing campaign that i would

02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:52,400
have that would have never even crossed

02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,400
my mind

02:07:52,719 --> 02:07:57,760
all right okay uh taking a quick detour

02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:58,960
from our regularly scheduled programming

02:07:57,760 --> 02:08:01,599
here's a neat gif

02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:03,199
my conscience wouldn't let me be free if

02:08:01,599 --> 02:08:04,159
i hadn't kept at least one resume

02:08:03,199 --> 02:08:06,960
related gif

02:08:04,159 --> 02:08:07,440
in the presentation so uh that's where

02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:10,320
it is

02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:12,639
uh a quick shout out to the fans of the

02:08:10,320 --> 02:08:12,639
office

02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:17,840
all right so getting back now we've

02:08:15,679 --> 02:08:19,520
briefly gone through the advantages of

02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:22,400
having an architecture where you allow

02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:24,400
translations for your app let's talk

02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:26,880
about how to adopt i18n

02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:28,320
into your app today something that can

02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:30,880
take minimal effort

02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:32,239
is adopting multiple currencies for when

02:08:30,880 --> 02:08:33,920
let's say you have an e-commerce

02:08:32,239 --> 02:08:35,840
platform

02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:37,920
on the other hand if you have an app

02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:40,320
where your users deal with

02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:41,599
dates and records it would go a long way

02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:44,960
to support an option to

02:08:41,599 --> 02:08:46,560
choose multiple date time formats

02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:48,239
on top of this implementing an

02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:50,079
architecture to include translations

02:08:48,239 --> 02:08:52,000
might be time consuming but a very

02:08:50,079 --> 02:08:54,960
fruitful task in the end

02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:56,159
you can make use of libraries like iet

02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:58,159
next

02:08:56,159 --> 02:08:59,199
uh to incorporate the architecture

02:08:58,159 --> 02:09:02,079
necessary to try

02:08:59,199 --> 02:09:02,639
allow translations into your app there

02:09:02,079 --> 02:09:04,880
are even

02:09:02,639 --> 02:09:06,880
automation tools like iet index scanner

02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:10,400
to help you extract all the strings

02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:12,239
from your app into a single json file

02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:14,320
next you can use a translation

02:09:12,239 --> 02:09:16,000
management platform such as crowdin

02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:18,079
to help you manage your different

02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:20,480
languages and strings

02:09:18,079 --> 02:09:22,159
this aids in non-tech folks as well to

02:09:20,480 --> 02:09:24,480
help you translate your app

02:09:22,159 --> 02:09:28,800
without having to clone your github repo

02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:31,599
and edit a json file without any context

02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:32,159
a big big shout out to github's student

02:09:31,599 --> 02:09:35,199
developer

02:09:32,159 --> 02:09:37,040
back here if you have access to this it

02:09:35,199 --> 02:09:38,719
has a lot of offers for much more

02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:41,040
advanced and feature rich

02:09:38,719 --> 02:09:43,040
language manager management platforms

02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:44,960
that you can use for your public or

02:09:43,040 --> 02:09:47,360
private repositories

02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:49,040
fun fact i actually found crowding

02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:51,599
through this list myself

02:09:49,040 --> 02:09:55,199
and countless of other tools that help

02:09:51,599 --> 02:09:55,199
me in building reactive resume

02:09:57,040 --> 02:10:01,440
before moving to the end of this talk

02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:02,079
i'd like to go through a few glossary of

02:10:01,440 --> 02:10:03,920
words

02:10:02,079 --> 02:10:06,320
that you would tend to come across while

02:10:03,920 --> 02:10:08,639
dwelling in the domain of languages

02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:10,639
they all might seem the same but there

02:10:08,639 --> 02:10:12,560
is a very important distinction between

02:10:10,639 --> 02:10:14,320
each of them and understanding them

02:10:12,560 --> 02:10:16,079
would ensure that you've covered your

02:10:14,320 --> 02:10:18,960
bases

02:10:16,079 --> 02:10:20,159
ga 11n is the father of all buzzwords

02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:22,480
globalization

02:10:20,159 --> 02:10:23,679
it simply means to make your existing

02:10:22,480 --> 02:10:26,159
product available

02:10:23,679 --> 02:10:27,599
uh to a global market the methods of

02:10:26,159 --> 02:10:31,360
making a product global

02:10:27,599 --> 02:10:32,719
well that's what's coming next i 18n

02:10:31,360 --> 02:10:34,800
is the one that i used to title the

02:10:32,719 --> 02:10:36,239
stock and repeated numerous times during

02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:37,960
this presentation

02:10:36,239 --> 02:10:39,360
but it isn't everything

02:10:37,960 --> 02:10:42,320
internationalization

02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:44,639
uh means to try to make your product

02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:46,480
cater to an international audience

02:10:44,639 --> 02:10:47,840
this could mean that they speak the same

02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:50,000
language as you but

02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:52,800
have other differences such as currency

02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:55,040
or date time formats

02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:56,880
l10n is something that i haven't picked

02:10:55,040 --> 02:10:59,280
on specifically for this talk

02:10:56,880 --> 02:11:00,480
but an important step nevertheless

02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:02,800
localization is

02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:04,639
all about creating content that caters

02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:08,079
to audience from different cultures

02:11:04,639 --> 02:11:10,159
or even different languages for example

02:11:08,079 --> 02:11:11,920
if you were to have a cooking blog you

02:11:10,159 --> 02:11:13,679
wouldn't want to feature an article

02:11:11,920 --> 02:11:15,760
about biryani recipes

02:11:13,679 --> 02:11:17,760
in a location that's known for its sweet

02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:19,599
tooth you would want to tailor some

02:11:17,760 --> 02:11:20,239
specific content for people located

02:11:19,599 --> 02:11:23,119
there

02:11:20,239 --> 02:11:25,760
maybe gulab jamun on a much grander

02:11:23,119 --> 02:11:28,000
scale netflix tries to incorporate

02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:29,840
localization by actively producing

02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:31,760
content not just in english

02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:35,119
but in other spoken languages such as

02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:38,400
spanish hindi or even tamil

02:11:35,119 --> 02:11:40,000
t9n is all about translation making your

02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:42,560
user interface available

02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:43,040
for consumption in multiple languages

02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:46,560
that's

02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:48,000
it and finally a11y

02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:50,719
is something you might have heard about

02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:53,679
in other contexts accessibility

02:11:50,719 --> 02:11:54,719
but equally applicable here by creating

02:11:53,679 --> 02:11:57,360
more products

02:11:54,719 --> 02:11:58,719
that can be used in multiple languages

02:11:57,360 --> 02:12:02,880
we are creating a much

02:11:58,719 --> 02:12:02,880
more accessible internet for everyone

02:12:04,719 --> 02:12:08,639
coming back to the original idea that i

02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:10,960
wanted to share with you

02:12:08,639 --> 02:12:12,079
if there's just one thing to take away

02:12:10,960 --> 02:12:14,960
from this lightning talk

02:12:12,079 --> 02:12:15,520
it's that if you have an app out there

02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:17,360
today

02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:18,880
or better yet if you're planning to

02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:20,400
build your next project

02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:21,920
please make it accessible through

02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:24,400
multiple language of

02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:26,719
multiple languages your users will thank

02:12:24,400 --> 02:12:29,040
you for it

02:12:26,719 --> 02:12:30,159
i'd like to take a quick slide to

02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:32,239
dedicate this talk

02:12:30,159 --> 02:12:34,000
to all the people who helped reactive

02:12:32,239 --> 02:12:36,079
resume be what it is today

02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:37,679
to all the donations made to all the

02:12:36,079 --> 02:12:39,040
pr's that have been raised

02:12:37,679 --> 02:12:41,280
and the languages that have been

02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:43,280
contributed a big thank you to all of

02:12:41,280 --> 02:12:45,840

where i'll also be sharing links to this

02:12:59,599 --> 02:13:02,480
slide and other resources spoken for in

02:13:01,760 --> 02:13:05,520
this talk so

02:13:02,480 --> 02:13:07,440
yeah come say hi thank you

02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:08,719
to github india for this amazing

02:13:07,440 --> 02:13:10,960
opportunity and

02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:12,639
thank you so much to everyone watching

you've really made

02:13:12,639 --> 02:13:17,840
one of my dreams come true today bye

02:13:23,040 --> 02:13:28,880
wow wow you know arisha uh amrit is

02:13:26,320 --> 02:13:31,040
talking about internationalization yes i

got it okay i18n

02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:36,960
and localization especially his mention

02:13:33,440 --> 02:13:39,840
around gulab jamun really made me

02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:42,079
very very very excited actually you know

02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:42,560
but that was really interesting to know

02:13:42,079 --> 02:13:44,880
about

02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:46,800
uh you know those that that quick talk

02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:49,440
uh lightning talk he had around

02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:49,920
reactive resume and you know how uh he

02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:53,599
was

02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:54,960
able to internationalize

02:13:53,599 --> 02:13:56,639
you know i should probably start

02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:59,840
creating something uh

02:13:56,639 --> 02:14:01,840
you know for it anyhow uh so don't

02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:04,079
forget that amrit is gonna be around on

02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:05,920
get up discussion so head over to github

02:14:04,079 --> 02:14:06,719
satellite dot com slash discussions

02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:09,040
where

02:14:06,719 --> 02:14:11,119

um anisha what do we have coming up next

02:14:17,360 --> 02:14:21,360
we had like

02:14:18,079 --> 02:14:22,560
one lightning talk yeah so you really

02:14:21,360 --> 02:14:24,639
don't want to blink again

02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:26,400
because guess what we have another

02:14:24,639 --> 02:14:28,400

right now as well and that session is

02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:31,679
flutter and github how open source

02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:33,840
really changed my life

02:14:31,679 --> 02:14:34,719
in this session you'll see how flutter

02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:37,599
and github can

02:14:34,719 --> 02:14:38,159
really be applied to real-world cases as

02:14:37,599 --> 02:14:40,719
well

02:14:38,159 --> 02:14:42,719
and taking us through that journey uh i

want to introduce kamal shree

02:14:42,719 --> 02:14:46,159
uh who is a program manager at what's up

02:14:45,199 --> 02:14:48,079
coders

02:14:46,159 --> 02:14:50,159
and i am definitely looking forward to

02:14:48,079 --> 02:14:50,960

come on change my life

02:15:22,079 --> 02:15:26,480
hello everyone welcome to my session

02:15:24,480 --> 02:15:28,639
flutter and github how open source

02:15:26,480 --> 02:15:31,119
changed my life

02:15:28,639 --> 02:15:31,679
well i'm kamal i'm a gdm flutter and

02:15:31,119 --> 02:15:35,119
dart

02:15:31,679 --> 02:15:37,360
a youtuber and a mentor well the session

02:15:35,119 --> 02:15:39,760
is not the usage session where you talk

02:15:37,360 --> 02:15:40,400
about or endorse about a technology or a

02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:42,560
tool

02:15:40,400 --> 02:15:44,560
here i'm going to share my experience

02:15:42,560 --> 02:15:46,960
and the importance of open source

02:15:44,560 --> 02:15:47,840
and how businesses are adopting open

02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:50,639
source

02:15:47,840 --> 02:15:52,560
and also how it impacted my career and

02:15:50,639 --> 02:15:56,560
choosing one changed my life

02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:56,560
and building a sustainable products

02:15:57,920 --> 02:16:01,440
so i believe that managing an open

02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:02,079
source project requires different

02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:04,800
demands

02:16:02,079 --> 02:16:06,719
and leadership and it's very true and

02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:08,800
it's completely changed my overall

02:16:06,719 --> 02:16:10,560
perception and working style towards

02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:13,599
open source project

02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:15,440
i think if it's managed right and if it

02:16:13,599 --> 02:16:16,000
is delivering an industrial strength

02:16:15,440 --> 02:16:18,480
system

02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:19,520
that meets user needs and provides

02:16:18,480 --> 02:16:21,840
solution

02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:24,320
there are which are fully extendable

02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:27,520
maintainable over a long period of time

02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:30,239
the resulting code is so much consistent

02:16:27,520 --> 02:16:32,399
and easier to manifest so let's see what

02:16:30,239 --> 02:16:33,200
was my working style prior to open

02:16:32,399 --> 02:16:35,439
source

02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:36,639
definitely it was enterprise and closed

02:16:35,439 --> 02:16:39,920
project

02:16:36,639 --> 02:16:42,880
in fact i was quite content with it and

02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:44,960
definitely open source or closed source

02:16:42,880 --> 02:16:48,000
had a lot of pros and cons

02:16:44,960 --> 02:16:50,479
where you had strict guidelines and a

02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:52,479
very organized way of managing things

02:16:50,479 --> 02:16:53,679
whether it could be designing documents

02:16:52,479 --> 02:16:57,359
or coding and

02:16:53,679 --> 02:16:59,120
testing or avoiding

02:16:57,359 --> 02:17:01,359
you know what i i feel that most of the

02:16:59,120 --> 02:17:01,679
enterprise organizations or software's

02:17:01,359 --> 02:17:04,080
they

02:17:01,679 --> 02:17:04,960
try avoiding taking risk as much as

02:17:04,080 --> 02:17:08,160
possible

02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:10,559
with a lot of approvals rules protocols

02:17:08,160 --> 02:17:11,439
and finally the information was always

02:17:10,559 --> 02:17:13,920
private

02:17:11,439 --> 02:17:15,760
we had less number of input information

02:17:13,920 --> 02:17:17,679
being exposed

02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:19,760
some of the pros that i would say about

02:17:17,679 --> 02:17:21,200
an enterprise or an open source or a

02:17:19,760 --> 02:17:24,319
closed source would be

02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:27,200
good supportive system user friendliness

02:17:24,319 --> 02:17:30,960
and unified experience and i was pretty

02:17:27,200 --> 02:17:30,960
content with this style of working

02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:35,120
well before i start dwelling into open

02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:37,040
source let's see how and when did open

02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:40,080
source really start

02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:42,639
if you see it started way back in 1950

02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:44,559
and 1960s we had compilers being

02:17:42,639 --> 02:17:46,160
delivered as part of hardware purchase

02:17:44,559 --> 02:17:49,280
without separate fees

02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:49,679
wow that's interesting and in 1970s we

02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:53,200
had

02:17:49,679 --> 02:17:56,800
software from ibm in 1980 richard

02:17:53,200 --> 02:17:59,120
launched gnu project in 1990 we had the

02:17:56,800 --> 02:18:01,439
first version of linux was introduced

02:17:59,120 --> 02:18:03,040
mozilla was started open source

02:18:01,439 --> 02:18:05,280
initiative was started

02:18:03,040 --> 02:18:08,080
and 2000 we had apache which was

02:18:05,280 --> 02:18:11,120
developed and maintained by open source

02:18:08,080 --> 02:18:11,679
we had mysql the first database php

02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:15,200
which was

02:18:11,679 --> 02:18:16,559
almost installed on more than 2409

02:18:15,200 --> 02:18:19,599
million websites

02:18:16,559 --> 02:18:21,519
and with 2.1 million web servers

02:18:19,599 --> 02:18:22,880
and the software which we use day in and

02:18:21,519 --> 02:18:25,840
day out wordpress

02:18:22,880 --> 02:18:27,120
vlc player notepad plus plus ubuntu

02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:29,599
android flutter

02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:31,040
and the list keeps on going so once

02:18:29,599 --> 02:18:33,920
that's all indicate

02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:35,840
this clearly says that all companies are

02:18:33,920 --> 02:18:39,120
adopting open source and it's become the

02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:41,359
future now

02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:43,280
so did you know as per the survey 44

02:18:41,359 --> 02:18:44,319
percent of the organization are using

02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:47,200
open source

02:18:44,319 --> 02:18:48,399
as a resource or the as the rescue

02:18:47,200 --> 02:18:50,160
operations

02:18:48,399 --> 02:18:52,319
and companies have started changing the

02:18:50,160 --> 02:18:52,960
policy saying do you have open source

02:18:52,319 --> 02:18:55,120
skills

02:18:52,960 --> 02:18:57,200
or have you contributed to open source

02:18:55,120 --> 02:18:58,559
rather than asking are you expertise in

02:18:57,200 --> 02:19:00,399
a particular skill

02:18:58,559 --> 02:19:02,160
so this kind of gives us a pinch that

02:19:00,399 --> 02:19:03,840
companies are really welcoming and

02:19:02,160 --> 02:19:05,599
adopting open source

02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:07,679
and the kind of impact it's creating in

02:19:05,599 --> 02:19:10,399
the market

02:19:07,679 --> 02:19:11,200
so working in an enterprise or a closed

02:19:10,399 --> 02:19:13,840
project was

02:19:11,200 --> 02:19:15,840
absolutely fine with me until then i

02:19:13,840 --> 02:19:17,679
realized that i was feeling constrained

02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:18,479
and kind of stuck and not flexible

02:19:17,679 --> 02:19:21,920
enough

02:19:18,479 --> 02:19:24,160
or i could not modify any features

02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:26,559
one of the factors was the licensing or

02:19:24,160 --> 02:19:28,479
the pricing which sometimes make me pull

02:19:26,559 --> 02:19:30,080
and it does not allow me to get the

02:19:28,479 --> 02:19:32,080
creative side of me

02:19:30,080 --> 02:19:35,840
where i was always kind of accepting

02:19:32,080 --> 02:19:35,840
whatever the existing feature was

02:19:38,960 --> 02:19:43,040
so my journey started working on all

02:19:46,840 --> 02:19:49,840
cases

02:19:58,240 --> 02:20:03,600
eventually started working on all faces

02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:06,399
schools all technologies coming from web

02:20:03,600 --> 02:20:09,680
mobile cross-platform and now focusing

02:20:06,399 --> 02:20:12,000
on building communities

02:20:09,680 --> 02:20:13,920
i see most of us are under the street

02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:17,200
concept

02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:21,520
it's all free no when i say free it's

02:20:17,200 --> 02:20:21,520
the freedom not in terms of price

02:20:22,560 --> 02:20:31,840
well i think open source is all about

02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:31,840
letting your creative

02:20:51,120 --> 02:20:54,720
so if you ask me now okay come on okay

02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:56,640
we got to know open source we know that

02:20:54,720 --> 02:20:59,040
it's been started way back then

02:20:56,640 --> 02:21:01,040
how do i get started if you're a newbie

02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:02,880
and if you're already working on it good

02:21:01,040 --> 02:21:04,720
but if you ask me where to start first

02:21:02,880 --> 02:21:06,399
kind of look for the popular projects on

02:21:04,720 --> 02:21:08,160
languages on github where we get a

02:21:06,399 --> 02:21:09,760
monthly or a weekly report

02:21:08,160 --> 02:21:12,080
talking about how the projects are being

02:21:09,760 --> 02:21:14,080
performing types of projects

02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:16,720
so projects could be security it could

02:21:14,080 --> 02:21:19,120
be virtual reality ai

02:21:16,720 --> 02:21:21,200
or flutter or a simple text editor you

02:21:19,120 --> 02:21:22,720
don't have to go for a complex project

02:21:21,200 --> 02:21:25,200
and choose a topic that actually

02:21:22,720 --> 02:21:27,439
interests you then look for the volume

02:21:25,200 --> 02:21:29,120
don't pick complex projects look for

02:21:27,439 --> 02:21:31,520
projects which are labeled as

02:21:29,120 --> 02:21:33,439
first time or easy beginner get the

02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:36,000
taste of it and then start getting your

02:21:33,439 --> 02:21:37,920
hands dirty with a complex product

02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:39,200
then okay fine i got to know the project

02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:42,000
now what next

02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:43,040
start fixing the bugs or pull request or

02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:45,040
documentation

02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:46,880
trust me documentation plays a very

02:21:45,040 --> 02:21:48,479
important role which most of the

02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:49,680
projects really lack in it

02:21:48,479 --> 02:21:51,840
if you're really good at writing

02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:52,960
articles documentation why don't you

02:21:51,840 --> 02:21:55,200
start with one

02:21:52,960 --> 02:21:56,880
or it could be a clean code clean code

02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:58,399
doesn't mean to just remove the comments

02:21:56,880 --> 02:22:01,600
or cleaning up your code

02:21:58,399 --> 02:22:03,359
i mean trying to reinvent the wheel or

02:22:01,600 --> 02:22:06,080
instead of reinventing the wheel try to

02:22:03,359 --> 02:22:08,479
fix the functionality of

02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:09,280
doing a various functions or something

02:22:08,479 --> 02:22:11,920
like that

02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:13,280
so understand um what this open source

02:22:11,920 --> 02:22:15,359
project is all about

02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:17,760
how much time you need to spend on it

02:22:15,359 --> 02:22:19,359
potentially is it used by how

02:22:17,760 --> 02:22:21,359
who are the users or what are the

02:22:19,359 --> 02:22:22,319
problems that this project has been

02:22:21,359 --> 02:22:24,160
going through

02:22:22,319 --> 02:22:28,080
so try to probe these kind of questions

02:22:24,160 --> 02:22:30,640
and then try working on the open source

02:22:28,080 --> 02:22:33,120
then what next so you know what are the

02:22:30,640 --> 02:22:35,120
popular language and you know what to do

02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:38,160
so there are many companies based their

02:22:35,120 --> 02:22:40,080
projects on free tools

02:22:38,160 --> 02:22:41,200
even though there are high selection of

02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:43,120
free softwares

02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:45,120
so i feel that instead of reinventing

02:22:43,120 --> 02:22:46,319
wheel try to look for the softwares

02:22:45,120 --> 02:22:48,080
which are licensed

02:22:46,319 --> 02:22:50,000
try to play around with it and if you

02:22:48,080 --> 02:22:52,160
find any feature that could be actually

02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:55,359
open sourced go ahead and do it what's

02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:55,359
stopping you from doing one

02:22:55,520 --> 02:22:59,520
and that's how my journey started into

02:22:57,359 --> 02:23:00,720
flutter and github really played a very

02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:03,120
vital role in

02:23:00,720 --> 02:23:04,960
achieving this journey to me so if you

02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:05,920
ask me what flutter is flutters is

02:23:04,960 --> 02:23:08,160
google's ui

02:23:05,920 --> 02:23:10,160
toolkit for building this beautiful

02:23:08,160 --> 02:23:11,040
natively compiled applications for

02:23:10,160 --> 02:23:14,000
mobile

02:23:11,040 --> 02:23:15,840
web desktop from a single code base let

02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,800
me reiterate that point from a single

02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:19,439
code base

02:23:16,800 --> 02:23:21,439
we recently launched frota2 and it's the

02:23:19,439 --> 02:23:23,200
same code that ships the native code to

02:23:21,439 --> 02:23:25,040
5 operating system

02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:27,439
yes you just listened to me i said 5

02:23:25,040 --> 02:23:30,720
operating system android windows mac

02:23:27,439 --> 02:23:32,000
linux and we also experience targeting

02:23:30,720 --> 02:23:35,280
browsers like chrome

02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:36,880
firefox safari and edge flutter can be

02:23:35,280 --> 02:23:40,000
embedded in cars

02:23:36,880 --> 02:23:42,560
tv smart home appliances providing most

02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:44,800
pervasive and portable experience for an

02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:46,479
ambient computing world

02:23:44,800 --> 02:23:48,160
and you can see the beauty of flutter in

02:23:46,479 --> 02:23:50,000
my next slide

02:23:48,160 --> 02:23:52,399
so this was one of the projects which

02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:54,399
was developed uh using open source

02:23:52,399 --> 02:23:56,720
where we have all the aggregations of

02:23:54,399 --> 02:23:57,680
libraries built by the community for the

02:23:56,720 --> 02:24:00,240
community and

02:23:57,680 --> 02:24:01,520
it's purely community driven you can see

02:24:00,240 --> 02:24:04,000
the libraries you can

02:24:01,520 --> 02:24:05,200
see the entire code you can see the pull

02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:07,280
request you can see

02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:09,600
issues being tracked so everything is

02:24:07,280 --> 02:24:10,560
free and open source and github plays a

02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:15,040
very big

02:24:10,560 --> 02:24:16,399
role in getting this done

02:24:15,040 --> 02:24:18,319
and these are a couple of open source

02:24:16,399 --> 02:24:19,359
sample projects created by developers

02:24:18,319 --> 02:24:21,359
like you and me

02:24:19,359 --> 02:24:22,880
where this was built by the rife tool

02:24:21,359 --> 02:24:26,399
and then we had the

02:24:22,880 --> 02:24:28,319
um animations and uh the dragon

02:24:26,399 --> 02:24:29,760
all this has been open sourced nothing

02:24:28,319 --> 02:24:31,760
is kind of proprietary

02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:33,280
or licensed so these are the kind of

02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:35,040
work communities doing when we have

02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:39,520
these awesome tools like

02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:41,120
github and we have flutter sdk

02:24:39,520 --> 02:24:42,800
and this is one more search tool which

02:24:41,120 --> 02:24:45,680
is called the dart pad where

02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:47,040
you can directly on online use the

02:24:45,680 --> 02:24:48,560
online browser to build these

02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:49,920
applications all you need to know is

02:24:48,560 --> 02:24:57,840
just the dart language

02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:57,840
and you're good to go

02:25:04,640 --> 02:25:08,160
and then moving on we also had sample

02:25:06,399 --> 02:25:10,160
plugins created by the

02:25:08,160 --> 02:25:11,200
community people where these all are

02:25:10,160 --> 02:25:12,960
kind of

02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:14,560
issues that we face in our daily life

02:25:12,960 --> 02:25:15,359
and we already have this ready-made

02:25:14,560 --> 02:25:17,439
plug-ins

02:25:15,359 --> 02:25:19,439
and user just has to plug in and use

02:25:17,439 --> 02:25:21,359
them and they're good to go this is also

02:25:19,439 --> 02:25:22,720
open-sourced

02:25:21,359 --> 02:25:24,560
so flutter if you'd like to get

02:25:22,720 --> 02:25:26,080
connected you can find ways to get

02:25:24,560 --> 02:25:28,160
connected twitter github

02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:30,000
anyway you will get connected with

02:25:28,160 --> 02:25:32,000
flutter and i think this is something

02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:33,280
that is also very important for building

02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:36,160
a very rich

02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:38,000
awesome community and we have one such

02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:40,000
community called flutterista

02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:41,040
where we are if you're interested in

02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,960
joining one

02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:44,880
um it's actually if you identify as a

02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:46,240
woman or a non-binary who have an

02:25:44,880 --> 02:25:48,399
interest in flutter

02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:49,280
join this community it's been run by two

02:25:48,399 --> 02:25:52,000
awesome

02:25:49,280 --> 02:25:53,200
um flutterstar daniel and stephanie if

02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:55,040
you want an invite just

02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:57,280
let me know and i'll send you an invite

02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:58,800
and you can get connected

02:25:57,280 --> 02:26:00,880
so another open source that i'm

02:25:58,800 --> 02:26:02,880
currently working is application

02:26:00,880 --> 02:26:04,800
library engineering group it is focused

02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:05,680
on building reusable application

02:26:04,800 --> 02:26:08,160
components

02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:09,680
that covers all platforms like android

02:26:08,160 --> 02:26:12,240
ios and harmony

02:26:09,680 --> 02:26:13,280
yes you heard it right harmony os it's

02:26:12,240 --> 02:26:15,920
an operating system

02:26:13,280 --> 02:26:17,600
designed for smart devices like smart tv

02:26:15,920 --> 02:26:19,120
and it has been used as a mobile

02:26:17,600 --> 02:26:20,960
operating system

02:26:19,120 --> 02:26:22,880
here we try to build libraries that

02:26:20,960 --> 02:26:26,000
support various fields

02:26:22,880 --> 02:26:28,240
ranging from health banking i am media

02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:30,560
music you name them and we have it there

02:26:28,240 --> 02:26:33,600
we are targeting and you are ux design

02:26:30,560 --> 02:26:36,160
to deployment reusability at each stage

02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:37,920
and we are trying to minimize the r d

02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:40,000
efforts in building the innovative

02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:42,560
solution in a popular middleware

02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,560
platforms

02:26:42,640 --> 02:26:46,319
our vision speaks our work and the

02:26:44,399 --> 02:26:49,840
process involved in building the first

02:26:46,319 --> 02:26:49,840
free open source community

02:26:50,319 --> 02:26:54,319
and the structure of this reusable

02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:56,319
component architecture is pretty simple

02:26:54,319 --> 02:26:58,640
your functional definition your multiple

02:26:56,319 --> 02:27:00,479
layouts and your configuration part

02:26:58,640 --> 02:27:02,560
whether it's an action handlers

02:27:00,479 --> 02:27:04,640
or it is an icon and you at the end you

02:27:02,560 --> 02:27:06,080
have the end results

02:27:04,640 --> 02:27:08,160
if you'd like to get connected with this

02:27:06,080 --> 02:27:09,359
community you can connect using all

02:27:08,160 --> 02:27:12,000
these channels

02:27:09,359 --> 02:27:13,920
and uh free fields to contribute open

02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:17,120
source partner with us

02:27:13,920 --> 02:27:18,880
and we'll be glad to have you and yeah

02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:21,200
that's it for today's session i think

02:27:18,880 --> 02:27:22,240
uh open source is the future we can see

02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:24,720
mobile web

02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:26,160
cloud solutions are increasingly built

02:27:24,720 --> 02:27:27,439
predominantly on open source

02:27:26,160 --> 02:27:29,520
infrastructure

02:27:27,439 --> 02:27:31,040
future architecture are highly to be

02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:33,359
based on open source

02:27:31,040 --> 02:27:34,160
so what's stopping you from building one

02:27:33,359 --> 02:27:35,840
try it

02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:45,840
and see what wonders you can come up

02:27:35,840 --> 02:27:45,840
with thank you

02:27:47,680 --> 02:27:51,359
oh that is that is really nice you know

02:27:50,160 --> 02:27:53,600
anisha right to

02:27:51,359 --> 02:27:54,640
to learn about kamal's journey about

02:27:53,600 --> 02:27:57,120
flutter and

02:27:54,640 --> 02:27:58,080
all the work that uh you know that she's

02:27:57,120 --> 02:28:00,720
been doing

02:27:58,080 --> 02:28:02,960
so again a reminder that kamal will be

02:28:00,720 --> 02:28:05,040
out on get up discussions so

02:28:02,960 --> 02:28:07,439
if you have any questions for her head

02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:11,120
over to getupsatellite.com

02:28:07,439 --> 02:28:14,399
discussions and drop in a note to her

02:28:11,120 --> 02:28:16,880
anisha you know i i noticed so many

02:28:14,399 --> 02:28:18,240
octocats out there in your in your

02:28:16,880 --> 02:28:21,600
background you know it's

02:28:18,240 --> 02:28:24,800
yes uh is that a puzzle of octocats

02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:27,280
yes that is actually a puzzle

02:28:24,800 --> 02:28:29,120
and there are thousands of octa cats in

02:28:27,280 --> 02:28:30,720
there it actually took me

02:28:29,120 --> 02:28:32,800
what i want to say about eight and a

02:28:30,720 --> 02:28:34,399
half hours to complete over a span of

02:28:32,800 --> 02:28:36,960
like three four days

02:28:34,399 --> 02:28:38,640
and it was pretty tough you know i i

02:28:36,960 --> 02:28:40,319
think there's like 400 and something odd

02:28:38,640 --> 02:28:42,560
odd pieces in there but

02:28:40,319 --> 02:28:44,240
once i completed it i was like wow this

02:28:42,560 --> 02:28:45,680
this definitely has to be framed

02:28:44,240 --> 02:28:47,520
and popped on the wall ready for

02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:49,600
satellite which i did but you know what

02:28:47,520 --> 02:28:50,160
i would love it if anyone can guess how

02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:52,560
many

02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:53,600
octa cats you can see just in my

02:28:52,560 --> 02:28:55,200
background actually

02:28:53,600 --> 02:28:56,800
including him and you can count in there

02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:59,520
if you can actually see it from

02:28:56,800 --> 02:29:00,800
from from the screen there but it was it

02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:02,800
was fantastic and

02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:04,560
i can see a couple on your side too

02:29:02,800 --> 02:29:06,560
karen

02:29:04,560 --> 02:29:08,560
oh yes you know there are there are many

02:29:06,560 --> 02:29:11,200
octocats out here as well

02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:13,359
though not completely visible you can

02:29:11,200 --> 02:29:16,399
you can see it right around me

02:29:13,359 --> 02:29:19,040
and a lot of different things that uh

02:29:16,399 --> 02:29:19,600
the octa cats out there are doing but

02:29:19,040 --> 02:29:21,840
yes

02:29:19,600 --> 02:29:22,960
uh with that one other thing that i want

02:29:21,840 --> 02:29:26,240
to remind all of you

02:29:22,960 --> 02:29:28,080
is the octocad generator so

02:29:26,240 --> 02:29:30,240
you know you can actually go and build

02:29:28,080 --> 02:29:32,880
and customize your own octa cad

02:29:30,240 --> 02:29:34,960
it's really cool you know um i'm pretty

02:29:32,880 --> 02:29:37,600
sure anisha might have her own

02:29:34,960 --> 02:29:39,120
octocat also hidden somewhere out over

02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:41,120
there in the background

02:29:39,120 --> 02:29:42,560
but you can go create your own uh

02:29:41,120 --> 02:29:44,880
octocad generator

02:29:42,560 --> 02:29:48,160
uh octocad on the optical generator so

02:31:58,560 --> 02:32:02,560
times

02:32:02,560 --> 02:32:07,200
become a new normal

02:32:04,240 --> 02:32:08,560
kovit 19 has had a significant impact

02:32:07,200 --> 02:32:11,120
around the world

02:32:08,560 --> 02:32:12,479
but alongside all the uncertainty and

02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:14,880
the severity

02:32:12,479 --> 02:32:16,720
we have also seen uh heartwarming and

02:32:14,880 --> 02:32:19,280
inspiring initiatives

02:32:16,720 --> 02:32:20,000
by a global and eclectic set of people

02:32:19,280 --> 02:32:22,960
you know be it

02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:24,000
scientists policy makers government

02:32:22,960 --> 02:32:26,720
officials

02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:28,560
concerned citizens or developers and

02:32:26,720 --> 02:32:30,800
they've all been working together

02:32:28,560 --> 02:32:33,200
at a feverish pace to help alleviate

02:32:30,800 --> 02:32:34,960
some of the impact of this pandemic

02:32:33,200 --> 02:32:37,200
there has been widespread and open

02:32:34,960 --> 02:32:39,280
collaboration around cover 19 and it has

02:32:37,200 --> 02:32:42,000
taken many shapes and forms

02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:43,840
from collaborative data repositories to

02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:45,680
apps that provide and gather local

02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:47,600
information to help the public

02:32:45,680 --> 02:32:49,439
to faster application of scientific

02:32:47,600 --> 02:32:53,920
methods through collaboration

02:32:49,439 --> 02:32:56,000
and even diy devices many of these

02:32:53,920 --> 02:32:56,960
are not really your traditional software

02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,960
projects

02:32:56,960 --> 02:33:01,760
and yet so many have been able to

02:32:58,960 --> 02:33:03,760
leverage github's collaboration platform

02:33:01,760 --> 02:33:05,439
that makes it easier for people around

02:33:03,760 --> 02:33:08,800
the world to work together

02:33:05,439 --> 02:33:11,200
towards a common goal so on that note

02:33:08,800 --> 02:33:13,120
i want to extend a warm welcome to anand

02:33:11,200 --> 02:33:14,880

an initiative to help those that are

02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:21,760
most affected by government

02:33:18,720 --> 02:33:25,439
in india anand and his team

02:33:21,760 --> 02:33:28,319
uh brought together startups corporates

02:33:25,439 --> 02:33:30,000
and non-profits and partnering together

02:33:28,319 --> 02:33:32,160
they collected donations

02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:33,439
that helps them to build a dry ration

02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:36,319
kit that could

02:33:33,439 --> 02:33:38,240
sustain a family for about a month and

02:33:36,319 --> 02:33:40,560
thus far they've been able to help

02:33:38,240 --> 02:33:41,840
12 000 people and been able to

02:33:40,560 --> 02:33:45,600
distribute one lakh

mosques to frontline workers indeed an

02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:51,120

and so over to you we are eager to hear

02:33:51,120 --> 02:33:55,200
more about

02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:56,080
how this journey started uh where we are

02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:59,520
along the way

02:33:56,080 --> 02:34:03,520
and uh specifically how technology and

02:33:59,520 --> 02:34:06,399
github has helped you in your efforts

02:34:03,520 --> 02:34:07,680
yeah absolutely uh it it just happened

02:34:06,399 --> 02:34:10,319
to be it was not

02:34:07,680 --> 02:34:12,319
uh well planned in the beginning i

02:34:10,319 --> 02:34:13,840
usually live in the netherlands and i

02:34:12,319 --> 02:34:15,840
came back to india

02:34:13,840 --> 02:34:17,200
because i was like you know it's

02:34:15,840 --> 02:34:19,120
lockdown season

02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:21,040
uh you're gonna work from home anyway so

02:34:19,120 --> 02:34:23,280
why be away from family

02:34:21,040 --> 02:34:24,399
and uh and i was like okay let me just

02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:27,680
get a flight ticket

02:34:24,399 --> 02:34:29,760
maybe couple weeks if not more but then

02:34:27,680 --> 02:34:32,160
that turned into a couple months

02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:33,920
and then even longer and now it's been

02:34:32,160 --> 02:34:36,240
almost exactly a year

02:34:33,920 --> 02:34:37,920
that i've been here and in fact i'm

02:34:36,240 --> 02:34:40,720
gonna go back in about 10 days

02:34:37,920 --> 02:34:41,120
finally i got the flight ticket back but

02:34:40,720 --> 02:34:42,880
um

02:34:41,120 --> 02:34:44,160
but so when i came came here for the

02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:46,160
first time i was

02:34:44,160 --> 02:34:48,000
doing my 10 day quarantine period i

02:34:46,160 --> 02:34:50,479
think it was two weeks back then

02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:51,600
as soon as i landed and my uncle who

02:34:50,479 --> 02:34:53,920
runs unifiers

02:34:51,600 --> 02:34:55,680
which is a social infrastructure company

02:34:53,920 --> 02:34:57,280
where they focus on you know training

02:34:55,680 --> 02:35:00,880
and skilling people of india

02:34:57,280 --> 02:35:03,760
he came to me and he said you know it's

02:35:00,880 --> 02:35:04,399
it there's not that much different in

02:35:03,760 --> 02:35:06,160
our life

02:35:04,399 --> 02:35:08,240
you know we're working from home we live

02:35:06,160 --> 02:35:11,439
in air conditioned department

02:35:08,240 --> 02:35:13,040
uh but there are so many migrant workers

02:35:11,439 --> 02:35:13,439
out there so these are people who come

02:35:13,040 --> 02:35:16,640
from

02:35:13,439 --> 02:35:19,760
villages and smaller cities in india

02:35:16,640 --> 02:35:21,600
who find daily labor jobs uh

02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:24,240
where you know they earn money day to

02:35:21,600 --> 02:35:26,160
day almost like hand to mouth

02:35:24,240 --> 02:35:28,160
and now that there is a nationwide

02:35:26,160 --> 02:35:29,040
lockdown in place they don't have work

02:35:28,160 --> 02:35:30,960
anymore

02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:32,560
uh and because of the lockdown also they

02:35:30,960 --> 02:35:33,920
cannot go back home so they're stuck

02:35:32,560 --> 02:35:36,240
here in the cities

02:35:33,920 --> 02:35:38,080
with literally no idea how they're gonna

02:35:36,240 --> 02:35:40,720
feed their family tonight

02:35:38,080 --> 02:35:42,880
uh and so from this place of privilege

02:35:40,720 --> 02:35:45,040
is that anything that we can do

02:35:42,880 --> 02:35:46,560
and we you know for me i'm a technology

02:35:45,040 --> 02:35:48,160
entrepreneur my whole background

02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:50,560
is in startups i've been building

02:35:48,160 --> 02:35:53,439
companies since i was in school

02:35:50,560 --> 02:35:54,000
uh through university now and so for me

02:35:53,439 --> 02:35:56,240
it's always like

02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:57,600
oh okay there's a problem uh i'm gonna

02:35:56,240 --> 02:35:59,359
build an app for that right

02:35:57,600 --> 02:36:00,640
there's always a technological solution

02:35:59,359 --> 02:36:02,319
in mind uh

02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:04,479
but of course you you have to kind of

02:36:02,319 --> 02:36:06,880
focus on the real grassroots work

02:36:04,479 --> 02:36:07,600
and and so how we started is i was like

02:36:06,880 --> 02:36:11,120
okay

02:36:07,600 --> 02:36:12,880
let's see who's in my uh friend circle

02:36:11,120 --> 02:36:14,000
and so we you know we built a dream team

02:36:12,880 --> 02:36:16,880
almost of

02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:17,760
students and entrepreneurs professionals

02:36:16,880 --> 02:36:21,040
and corporates

02:36:17,760 --> 02:36:22,399
startups journalists just volunteers in

02:36:21,040 --> 02:36:24,000
general and

02:36:22,399 --> 02:36:25,760
we decided we're gonna get on a zoom

02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:27,120
call every morning and then see what we

02:36:25,760 --> 02:36:30,000
can do about this

02:36:27,120 --> 02:36:31,359
uh so i started with building just a

02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:33,040
github organization

02:36:31,359 --> 02:36:35,280
and said okay let's get started from

02:36:33,040 --> 02:36:36,880
here so let me quickly share my screen

02:36:35,280 --> 02:36:41,600
and then i'm going to show you

02:36:36,880 --> 02:36:41,600
uh the repo absolutely

02:36:42,399 --> 02:36:46,319
yeah so you know i started like i do

02:36:44,560 --> 02:36:48,319
with all of my products right let's just

02:36:46,319 --> 02:36:50,479
build a github organization

02:36:48,319 --> 02:36:51,760
and we started by building a website for

02:36:50,479 --> 02:36:53,600
corona 2020

02:36:51,760 --> 02:36:55,280
this is our website uh it's a pretty

02:36:53,600 --> 02:36:57,200
simple place where you can get

02:36:55,280 --> 02:36:59,439
all the information about the impact

02:36:57,200 --> 02:37:00,640
about uh all the data about what we're

02:36:59,439 --> 02:37:03,280
working on right now

02:37:00,640 --> 02:37:04,960
and and like you already said our we

02:37:03,280 --> 02:37:06,399
decided that the best way to tackle this

02:37:04,960 --> 02:37:09,520
problem is to build

02:37:06,399 --> 02:37:12,000
a dry russian kit this is a meal kit

02:37:09,520 --> 02:37:14,560
which consists not of pre-cooked food

02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:15,840
but of things like rice and lentils and

02:37:14,560 --> 02:37:18,000
salt and oil

02:37:15,840 --> 02:37:20,479
and a kit that cost less than ten

02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:21,359
dollars can feed a family of four for a

02:37:20,479 --> 02:37:23,200
whole month

02:37:21,359 --> 02:37:25,280
so we decided that we want to raise

02:37:23,200 --> 02:37:28,080
money and make these kits

02:37:25,280 --> 02:37:29,760
and distribute them as much as we can uh

02:37:28,080 --> 02:37:30,479
just a little bit about the site in case

02:37:29,760 --> 02:37:33,680
you're curious

02:37:30,479 --> 02:37:35,520
uh it's based on emergency site which is

02:37:33,680 --> 02:37:36,960
an open source project that came out

02:37:35,520 --> 02:37:39,040
right during the pandemic

02:37:36,960 --> 02:37:41,120
with the idea that we might want to

02:37:39,040 --> 02:37:43,439
build websites that we want to be

02:37:41,120 --> 02:37:45,359
super fast in emergencies if people are

02:37:43,439 --> 02:37:47,359
quickly looking at them from their 2g

02:37:45,359 --> 02:37:49,840
internet smartphones so it has things

02:37:47,359 --> 02:37:52,240
like just one critical request with all

02:37:49,840 --> 02:37:54,160
inline css and so on and so we built on

02:37:52,240 --> 02:37:57,560
these great open source projects

02:37:54,160 --> 02:37:58,840
for our website and in general our

02:37:57,560 --> 02:38:00,240
[Music]

02:37:58,840 --> 02:38:03,520
technology

02:38:00,240 --> 02:38:06,720
great and um uh

02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:08,720
i know that in current 2020 uh you use a

02:38:06,720 --> 02:38:10,640
lot of github action workflows

02:38:08,720 --> 02:38:12,640
for automating common tasks that are

02:38:10,640 --> 02:38:15,520
otherwise manual and tedious and time

02:38:12,640 --> 02:38:16,880
consuming right

02:38:15,520 --> 02:38:19,280
yeah i'd love to tell you more about

02:38:16,880 --> 02:38:20,640
that uh in fact i want to tell you a

02:38:19,280 --> 02:38:22,720
quick story first because

02:38:20,640 --> 02:38:23,760
in the beginning it was like i said it

02:38:22,720 --> 02:38:26,399
was a zoom call

02:38:23,760 --> 02:38:26,800
and a bunch of volunteers and we would

02:38:26,399 --> 02:38:29,920
just

02:38:26,800 --> 02:38:31,760
have this big google sheet where we

02:38:29,920 --> 02:38:32,000
would just have all of the data coming

02:38:31,760 --> 02:38:33,520
in

02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:35,520
you know what are the donations coming

02:38:33,520 --> 02:38:38,000
in where are we buying the food

02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:39,760
from how do we assemble the kit and then

02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:42,720
how do we distribute it and it was just

02:38:39,760 --> 02:38:44,560
one huge sheet and imagine like how

02:38:42,720 --> 02:38:47,840
messy that spreadsheet can be

02:38:44,560 --> 02:38:50,080
and uh so my friend and uh volunteer

02:38:47,840 --> 02:38:51,439
uh shivek wrote this article about how

02:38:50,080 --> 02:38:52,720
he likes to call it closure of

02:38:51,439 --> 02:38:55,600
concurrency model

02:38:52,720 --> 02:38:57,280
head of kind of fix this uh and so this

02:38:55,600 --> 02:38:58,399
is what he calls like the first version

02:38:57,280 --> 02:38:59,600
of our runtime where

02:38:58,399 --> 02:39:01,600
everything's kind of running in a

02:38:59,600 --> 02:39:03,840
javascript main thread where we call

02:39:01,600 --> 02:39:05,120
these async functions which get data in

02:39:03,840 --> 02:39:08,479
and bring data out

02:39:05,120 --> 02:39:11,760
but this can get very messy very fast

02:39:08,479 --> 02:39:12,720
uh so we decided that we want to kind of

02:39:11,760 --> 02:39:14,800
switch to

02:39:12,720 --> 02:39:16,000
a closure concurrency model and if

02:39:14,800 --> 02:39:16,479
you're interested you should go through

02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,080
this

02:39:16,479 --> 02:39:20,960
uh article i have a link in the

02:39:18,080 --> 02:39:22,880
discussion but how we switched gears was

02:39:20,960 --> 02:39:24,160
now everything is kind of happening in

02:39:22,880 --> 02:39:26,640
cds and sets

02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:27,280
so just imagine a donor life cycle model

02:39:26,640 --> 02:39:29,520
where

02:39:27,280 --> 02:39:30,640
we receive information about a new

02:39:29,520 --> 02:39:33,040
donation coming in

02:39:30,640 --> 02:39:34,319
and then we would say okay we we will

02:39:33,040 --> 02:39:36,399
identify the donor

02:39:34,319 --> 02:39:37,600
we would move it to a column would say

02:39:36,399 --> 02:39:39,520
is ready for receipt

02:39:37,600 --> 02:39:41,520
and then we would use for example an

02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:44,160
automated github actions workflow

02:39:41,520 --> 02:39:45,520
which would generate a receipt so let me

02:39:44,160 --> 02:39:46,160
actually show you how this works in

02:39:45,520 --> 02:39:47,840
airtable

02:39:46,160 --> 02:39:50,720
which is the client we use to make this

02:39:47,840 --> 02:39:51,600
work um so for example a new donation

02:39:50,720 --> 02:39:53,359
comes in here

02:39:51,600 --> 02:39:54,880
in uncategorized and then we move it

02:39:53,359 --> 02:39:56,640
till we need to contact

02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:58,880
and then we would use an api to send

02:39:56,640 --> 02:40:00,640
them a message we would contact them

02:39:58,880 --> 02:40:02,319
and then when we move this card to ready

02:40:00,640 --> 02:40:05,520
for generating receipt

02:40:02,319 --> 02:40:08,000
we run a github actions workflow wayward

02:40:05,520 --> 02:40:09,520
which runs puppeteer which is a headless

02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:12,160
chromium automation tool

02:40:09,520 --> 02:40:13,760
which generates a pdf because in india

02:40:12,160 --> 02:40:14,560
for example when you contribute to a

02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:17,760
non-profit

02:40:14,560 --> 02:40:19,359
you get an atg tax receipt which you can

02:40:17,760 --> 02:40:20,240
use for your taxes to claim that as a

02:40:19,359 --> 02:40:21,680
deductible

02:40:20,240 --> 02:40:23,600
but of course we didn't want to do all

02:40:21,680 --> 02:40:24,319
of this work manually because the goal

02:40:23,600 --> 02:40:26,080
was

02:40:24,319 --> 02:40:27,920
all of the manual work should be limited

02:40:26,080 --> 02:40:28,960
to focusing on real grassroot

02:40:27,920 --> 02:40:31,279
distributions

02:40:28,960 --> 02:40:33,840
so then we move it move it and then

02:40:31,279 --> 02:40:36,160
that's the whole how the system works

02:40:33,840 --> 02:40:37,040
another good example is distribution uh

02:40:36,160 --> 02:40:40,040
because

02:40:37,040 --> 02:40:42,160
we use the same logic we fi we get

02:40:40,040 --> 02:40:44,000
uncategorized leads from people

02:40:42,160 --> 02:40:45,760
and then we ask them to make a list of

02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,319
phone numbers or other cards so that we

02:40:45,760 --> 02:40:48,240
can

02:40:46,319 --> 02:40:50,000
know that it's a real distribution there

02:40:48,240 --> 02:40:50,880
are real people in this part of town who

02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,720
need our help

02:40:50,880 --> 02:40:54,399
and then we approve the request assign a

02:40:52,720 --> 02:40:56,479
distributor deliver it

02:40:54,399 --> 02:40:57,920
uh and and one important thing for us

02:40:56,479 --> 02:40:59,439
was transparency

02:40:57,920 --> 02:41:01,040
because if we're asking people to give

02:40:59,439 --> 02:41:02,080
us money and we're saying we're going to

02:41:01,040 --> 02:41:04,240
feed people

02:41:02,080 --> 02:41:06,399
we need some evidence and so we decided

02:41:04,240 --> 02:41:08,399
that for every single person who gets a

02:41:06,399 --> 02:41:11,200
karuna 2020 dry russian kit

02:41:08,399 --> 02:41:12,399
we would ask to take that photo and so

02:41:11,200 --> 02:41:14,800
after the delivery

02:41:12,399 --> 02:41:17,279
we move it into the receive distribution

02:41:14,800 --> 02:41:18,800
pictures column and we attach all the

02:41:17,279 --> 02:41:21,200
photos that we received

02:41:18,800 --> 02:41:22,560
so of course this is a privacy issue

02:41:21,200 --> 02:41:25,439
right so we decided that

02:41:22,560 --> 02:41:27,359
we want to blur their faces at least uh

02:41:25,439 --> 02:41:28,399
so for example this is a real photo of a

02:41:27,359 --> 02:41:31,680
real person

02:41:28,399 --> 02:41:33,279
getting our kit and again using a github

02:41:31,680 --> 02:41:36,720
actions workflow

02:41:33,279 --> 02:41:38,080
we use a python library called face blur

02:41:36,720 --> 02:41:39,760
a custom version of it

02:41:38,080 --> 02:41:41,840
which takes all of these photos in

02:41:39,760 --> 02:41:44,080
automatically blurs them out and then

02:41:41,840 --> 02:41:46,479
uploads them to our cdn

02:41:44,080 --> 02:41:47,760
so we created a github repository called

02:41:46,479 --> 02:41:50,080
current2020

02:41:47,760 --> 02:41:51,520
open data because we wanted to make sure

02:41:50,080 --> 02:41:53,920
that we are accountable to

02:41:51,520 --> 02:41:54,880
our donors and everyone gets access to

02:41:53,920 --> 02:41:57,439
all of our data

02:41:54,880 --> 02:41:59,600
so how it works is literally the same

02:41:57,439 --> 02:42:02,240
data that we have here in airtable

02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:03,200
using the github actions status workflow

02:42:02,240 --> 02:42:05,520
shows up here

02:42:03,200 --> 02:42:06,920
as api endpoints so for example if you

02:42:05,520 --> 02:42:08,080
look at the api endpoint for

02:42:06,920 --> 02:42:10,000
donations.json

02:42:08,080 --> 02:42:12,319
you can literally see every single

02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:14,240
donation where it came from who gave it

02:42:12,319 --> 02:42:15,920
to us how how much was it for

02:42:14,240 --> 02:42:18,080
and the same with distributions and so

02:42:15,920 --> 02:42:19,120
on and all of this happens completely

02:42:18,080 --> 02:42:21,040
automatically

02:42:19,120 --> 02:42:23,279
uh in this case using a github actions

02:42:21,040 --> 02:42:25,680
workflow that takes data from airtable

02:42:23,279 --> 02:42:28,000
and then generates json endpoints and

02:42:25,680 --> 02:42:30,640
then we publish this entire repository

02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:32,160
on a github page's static website with

02:42:30,640 --> 02:42:32,960
which you can consume these api

02:42:32,160 --> 02:42:35,439
endpoints

02:42:32,960 --> 02:42:36,880
so everything happens automatically and

02:42:35,439 --> 02:42:38,960
that's kind of a little bit about

02:42:36,880 --> 02:42:41,279
our tech with the github actions

02:42:38,960 --> 02:42:43,439
workflows

02:42:41,279 --> 02:42:44,800
thanks anna that makes a lot of sense

02:42:43,439 --> 02:42:46,800
it's great to see this level of

02:42:44,800 --> 02:42:48,240
transparency and authenticity that's

02:42:46,800 --> 02:42:49,439
also getting built in you know into the

02:42:48,240 --> 02:42:50,880
system because i can

02:42:49,439 --> 02:42:52,479
totally see how that will build the

02:42:50,880 --> 02:42:53,279
trust and the confidence among the

02:42:52,479 --> 02:42:55,120
people who

02:42:53,279 --> 02:42:56,960
would like to contribute in the form of

02:42:55,120 --> 02:42:59,200
donations and and really see

02:42:56,960 --> 02:43:00,960
their uh their money you know uh

02:42:59,200 --> 02:43:02,800
reaching the right people

02:43:00,960 --> 02:43:04,160
and and really it's it's wonderful to

02:43:02,800 --> 02:43:06,479
see that github actions has

02:43:04,160 --> 02:43:08,000
helped you to automate these workflows

02:43:06,479 --> 02:43:09,760
and you know make you more efficient so

02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,560
that you're able to focus on what you do

02:43:09,760 --> 02:43:13,439
best

02:43:10,560 --> 02:43:14,080
and uh just great to see that so what do

02:43:13,439 --> 02:43:16,160
you see

02:43:14,080 --> 02:43:18,720
as some of the next set of challenges

02:43:16,160 --> 02:43:22,319
ahead and and how can the community

02:43:18,720 --> 02:43:23,040
contribute yeah i think the community

02:43:22,319 --> 02:43:25,279
has been

02:43:23,040 --> 02:43:27,600
such a large part of what we're doing

02:43:25,279 --> 02:43:29,439
here uh whenever i'm free you know i

02:43:27,600 --> 02:43:32,319
just like to browse through

02:43:29,439 --> 02:43:34,000
uh the github topic for covet 19 and

02:43:32,319 --> 02:43:36,240
then just kind of scroll around

02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:38,960
to see what people are up to and there

02:43:36,240 --> 02:43:40,960
are such great resources out there

02:43:38,960 --> 02:43:43,120
uh some of my favorite ones are the

02:43:40,960 --> 02:43:43,760
covet 19 data wrapper from the new york

02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:45,680
times

02:43:43,760 --> 02:43:48,399
which as it turns out also uses a little

02:43:45,680 --> 02:43:50,319
bot uh which uses github actions to

02:43:48,399 --> 02:43:51,840
fetch data from all of these different

02:43:50,319 --> 02:43:53,760
sources and then

02:43:51,840 --> 02:43:56,160
give it to you in an easily consumable

02:43:53,760 --> 02:43:58,319
state-wise us data way

02:43:56,160 --> 02:43:59,680
another repo that i really like is covet

02:43:58,319 --> 02:44:02,720
19 india react

02:43:59,680 --> 02:44:04,319
which is a react website written also by

02:44:02,720 --> 02:44:07,040
a set of volunteers

02:44:04,319 --> 02:44:08,399
around the world um and this is what it

02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:10,880
looks like you can go to that little

02:44:08,399 --> 02:44:13,279
website and you can see all the cases

02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:14,640
uh statewide data find information about

02:44:13,279 --> 02:44:16,720
vaccination

02:44:14,640 --> 02:44:18,399
get trends it's a really fast really

02:44:16,720 --> 02:44:21,680
nice site written entirely

02:44:18,399 --> 02:44:23,200
in react by a group of uh contributors

02:44:21,680 --> 02:44:24,960
from around the world

02:44:23,200 --> 02:44:26,560
and i want to highlight one more which

02:44:24,960 --> 02:44:28,720
is corona cli

02:44:26,560 --> 02:44:30,880
because this is especially interesting

02:44:28,720 --> 02:44:34,319
to developers it's made by my friend

02:44:30,880 --> 02:44:36,000
and fellow github star emma and as the

02:44:34,319 --> 02:44:38,240
name implies it's literally

02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:39,279
a command line interface where you can

02:44:38,240 --> 02:44:42,000
get data

02:44:39,279 --> 02:44:43,439
about the coronavirus uh citywise

02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:45,840
countrywide statewide

02:44:43,439 --> 02:44:47,120
in your terminal so so if you're if

02:44:45,840 --> 02:44:47,600
you're a developer you don't even need

02:44:47,120 --> 02:44:49,520
to

02:44:47,600 --> 02:44:51,040
leave your terminal to get up-to-date

02:44:49,520 --> 02:44:53,279
statistics so

02:44:51,040 --> 02:44:54,479
i think the community is really coming

02:44:53,279 --> 02:44:56,560
together and

02:44:54,479 --> 02:44:58,000
uh you know people it's so amazing to

02:44:56,560 --> 02:44:58,640
see all of these people from around the

02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:01,760
world

02:44:58,640 --> 02:45:03,439
uh come together and try to contribute

02:45:01,760 --> 02:45:04,960
to open source and make sure everyone

02:45:03,439 --> 02:45:07,760
has access to

02:45:04,960 --> 02:45:09,439
uh the right data transparent data uh

02:45:07,760 --> 02:45:11,439
and people are all doing this from their

02:45:09,439 --> 02:45:12,560
homes in their free time in a volunteer

02:45:11,439 --> 02:45:15,040
led effort

02:45:12,560 --> 02:45:17,040
uh and so i think really the solution to

02:45:15,040 --> 02:45:20,000
all of these challenges of finding

02:45:17,040 --> 02:45:21,600
you know honest data uh in in mitigating

02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:23,040
the pandemic with even if you look at

02:45:21,600 --> 02:45:26,000
vaccination data

02:45:23,040 --> 02:45:26,399
is all of these volunteer led efforts

02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,160
that

02:45:26,399 --> 02:45:29,920
make all of this information that is

02:45:28,160 --> 02:45:34,160
typically you know gate

02:45:29,920 --> 02:45:34,160
kept uh and and make it open source

02:45:34,960 --> 02:45:38,399
that sounds good great and uh and i

02:45:36,880 --> 02:45:40,160
believe you mentioned that as part of

02:45:38,399 --> 02:45:42,560
coronado 2020 as well

02:45:40,160 --> 02:45:43,840
you have leveraged certain open source

02:45:42,560 --> 02:45:44,720
projects like you talked about the

02:45:43,840 --> 02:45:48,240
emergency

02:45:44,720 --> 02:45:50,080
uh um services uh kind of

02:45:48,240 --> 02:45:52,399
uh maybe you can tell us a little bit

02:45:50,080 --> 02:45:54,240
about that experience you know consuming

02:45:52,399 --> 02:45:55,040
and building on top of somebody else's

02:45:54,240 --> 02:45:58,560
work

02:45:55,040 --> 02:46:00,399
and also how do you feel about um

02:45:58,560 --> 02:46:02,800
you know from the work that you've done

02:46:00,399 --> 02:46:04,319
do you see some best practices emerging

02:46:02,800 --> 02:46:06,880
for non-profits

02:46:04,319 --> 02:46:09,279
you know when it comes to uh you know

02:46:06,880 --> 02:46:12,080
sort of building some of these workflows

02:46:09,279 --> 02:46:13,840
and you know how do you think about that

02:46:12,080 --> 02:46:15,600
yeah absolutely you know just as an

02:46:13,840 --> 02:46:16,800
example if you look at our website

02:46:15,600 --> 02:46:19,439
repository

02:46:16,800 --> 02:46:20,880
uh we don't just have an open source

02:46:19,439 --> 02:46:22,640
project so that we can get the free

02:46:20,880 --> 02:46:25,520
github actions minutes

02:46:22,640 --> 02:46:26,560
the idea is uh we're building on top of

02:46:25,520 --> 02:46:28,319
all of these great

02:46:26,560 --> 02:46:29,920
open source projects like i gave you the

02:46:28,319 --> 02:46:33,120
example of the

02:46:29,920 --> 02:46:34,800
blurring project uh which we forked and

02:46:33,120 --> 02:46:36,479
shivek added a feature that we could do

02:46:34,800 --> 02:46:38,080
all of these requests in parallel

02:46:36,479 --> 02:46:40,160
rather than series so that it happens

02:46:38,080 --> 02:46:42,720
much faster and it's just a simple

02:46:40,160 --> 02:46:44,880
python library that takes any photo in

02:46:42,720 --> 02:46:46,880
and gives you a blurred version of it

02:46:44,880 --> 02:46:49,600
and this was very important to us

02:46:46,880 --> 02:46:51,359
because we knew that we have to balance

02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:53,439
individual privacy with

02:46:51,359 --> 02:46:55,200
making sure we are accountable and we

02:46:53,439 --> 02:46:58,000
share photos for example

02:46:55,200 --> 02:46:58,560
uh so we it's we're really building on

02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,399
top of

02:46:58,560 --> 02:47:02,720
this years of effort by other open

02:47:00,399 --> 02:47:04,560
source people and and like you said with

02:47:02,720 --> 02:47:06,880
non-profits usually

02:47:04,560 --> 02:47:08,800
you see there's a lot of manual work

02:47:06,880 --> 02:47:11,359
like i gave you the example of the atg

02:47:08,800 --> 02:47:13,520
tax receipts people usually generate

02:47:11,359 --> 02:47:15,840
these by hand in an excel document and

02:47:13,520 --> 02:47:16,640
then export it as a pdf and then send it

02:47:15,840 --> 02:47:18,640
to people

02:47:16,640 --> 02:47:20,240
and in our case we would just literally

02:47:18,640 --> 02:47:22,319
have an a table record that we got a

02:47:20,240 --> 02:47:23,600
donation in we would manually verify it

02:47:22,319 --> 02:47:24,479
and move it to a column

02:47:23,600 --> 02:47:26,960
and then everything happens

02:47:24,479 --> 02:47:28,080
automatically that we use an api to send

02:47:26,960 --> 02:47:30,479
them a message

02:47:28,080 --> 02:47:31,920
we use puppeteer to generate a pdf and

02:47:30,479 --> 02:47:32,960
then we use node mailer to

02:47:31,920 --> 02:47:35,680
programmatically

02:47:32,960 --> 02:47:37,120
email it to them as an attachment and so

02:47:35,680 --> 02:47:39,279
the idea was

02:47:37,120 --> 02:47:40,479
uh why stop here right we are just

02:47:39,279 --> 02:47:42,720
volunteers who

02:47:40,479 --> 02:47:43,760
for example i run a technology company

02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:46,800
in switzerland

02:47:43,760 --> 02:47:47,200
um we're only doing this in our free

02:47:46,800 --> 02:47:49,359
time

02:47:47,200 --> 02:47:50,399
as a weight is a really small way to

02:47:49,359 --> 02:47:52,960
give back

02:47:50,399 --> 02:47:54,479
but uh there are real non-profits who we

02:47:52,960 --> 02:47:55,520
partnered with for example for the

02:47:54,479 --> 02:47:57,359
distribution

02:47:55,520 --> 02:47:58,640
who are doing this every day and they've

02:47:57,359 --> 02:48:00,800
been doing it for years

02:47:58,640 --> 02:48:03,120
so how can we kind of help them with our

02:48:00,800 --> 02:48:05,920
tech uh to take it forward

02:48:03,120 --> 02:48:06,960
and uh and and one really powerful thing

02:48:05,920 --> 02:48:09,279
we did here was

02:48:06,960 --> 02:48:10,240
guides so on our website you can have a

02:48:09,279 --> 02:48:12,560
look at

02:48:10,240 --> 02:48:14,160
all of the all of these free and open

02:48:12,560 --> 02:48:16,000
source guides that we have written

02:48:14,160 --> 02:48:17,520
all of our volunteers have contributed

02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:19,520
to these uh

02:48:17,520 --> 02:48:21,439
and and they tell us about for example

02:48:19,520 --> 02:48:22,080
the face blur and identity protection

02:48:21,439 --> 02:48:24,399
guide

02:48:22,080 --> 02:48:26,880
where you can read how why do we want to

02:48:24,399 --> 02:48:30,080
do this what parts of the face should we

02:48:26,880 --> 02:48:31,840
uh redact and what technology do we use

02:48:30,080 --> 02:48:33,359
uh how do you install it how do you use

02:48:31,840 --> 02:48:36,319
it uh and so on

02:48:33,359 --> 02:48:36,960
and for and even like more specific

02:48:36,319 --> 02:48:39,600
things like

02:48:36,960 --> 02:48:41,279
are russian kid how do you assemble it

02:48:39,600 --> 02:48:42,960
what should go in each kit

02:48:41,279 --> 02:48:44,479
uh how do you package it how do you make

02:48:42,960 --> 02:48:44,800
sure the people who are distributing

02:48:44,479 --> 02:48:48,080
them

02:48:44,800 --> 02:48:50,000
are always safe um or

02:48:48,080 --> 02:48:52,560
our distribution management guide about

02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:54,160
how do we manage distributions our donor

02:48:52,560 --> 02:48:55,200
lifecycle management guide where you can

02:48:54,160 --> 02:48:57,600
have a look at

02:48:55,200 --> 02:48:59,279
how do we get people to fill the form

02:48:57,600 --> 02:49:01,040
when we get the donation what do you do

02:48:59,279 --> 02:49:01,920
when you don't know who a donor is how

02:49:01,040 --> 02:49:04,160
do you offend them

02:49:01,920 --> 02:49:05,760
so the idea is we wrote all of these in

02:49:04,160 --> 02:49:07,120
markdown format and put them in our

02:49:05,760 --> 02:49:09,359
github repository

02:49:07,120 --> 02:49:10,560
and you can have a look at all of these

02:49:09,359 --> 02:49:12,479
um and you can

02:49:10,560 --> 02:49:14,560
and literally like just things that are

02:49:12,479 --> 02:49:16,640
not related to the distribution

02:49:14,560 --> 02:49:18,560
for example our social media outreach

02:49:16,640 --> 02:49:20,319
guide tells you that hey we should tell

02:49:18,560 --> 02:49:21,680
all of the people who have donated about

02:49:20,319 --> 02:49:24,560
what we're working on

02:49:21,680 --> 02:49:25,200
um how do you design each social media

02:49:24,560 --> 02:49:26,880
post

02:49:25,200 --> 02:49:28,720
and we made a little template with you

02:49:26,880 --> 02:49:29,840
which you just had to edit with the new

02:49:28,720 --> 02:49:32,240
distribution

02:49:29,840 --> 02:49:32,960
and then all of this also is completely

02:49:32,240 --> 02:49:35,040
automated

02:49:32,960 --> 02:49:36,160
so whenever we receive the photos of a

02:49:35,040 --> 02:49:39,200
distribution

02:49:36,160 --> 02:49:39,680
we assign it a social media outreach

02:49:39,200 --> 02:49:42,319
card

02:49:39,680 --> 02:49:44,640
also linked to it so as you can see here

02:49:42,319 --> 02:49:46,960
this card is linked to this record

02:49:44,640 --> 02:49:49,040
and in that card we have a little note

02:49:46,960 --> 02:49:52,160
just a description about what we did

02:49:49,040 --> 02:49:54,160
some photos and a hero image and all of

02:49:52,160 --> 02:49:55,840
this works with the same model where

02:49:54,160 --> 02:49:56,560
when we have an idea we upload some

02:49:55,840 --> 02:49:58,560
photos

02:49:56,560 --> 02:50:00,000
we design the graphics we write the text

02:49:58,560 --> 02:50:01,359
and then as soon as we move it to

02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:03,680
publish to website

02:50:01,359 --> 02:50:04,720
this automatically again using a github

02:50:03,680 --> 02:50:06,560
actions workflow

02:50:04,720 --> 02:50:08,160
shows up over here in our updates and

02:50:06,560 --> 02:50:10,160
people can share the link

02:50:08,160 --> 02:50:12,080
and we also use some automations to

02:50:10,160 --> 02:50:13,920
automatically tweet about it and so on

02:50:12,080 --> 02:50:15,520
and so we've set up all of these systems

02:50:13,920 --> 02:50:17,680
in place not for us

02:50:15,520 --> 02:50:19,600
but with the idea that using our open

02:50:17,680 --> 02:50:20,240
source guides and all of our open source

02:50:19,600 --> 02:50:22,240
code

02:50:20,240 --> 02:50:23,840
other non-profits can build on top of

02:50:22,240 --> 02:50:26,479
this or at least just

02:50:23,840 --> 02:50:27,520
use these to make their manual work much

02:50:26,479 --> 02:50:30,640
easier

02:50:27,520 --> 02:50:33,359
um the second quick note is because

02:50:30,640 --> 02:50:34,479
of github's powerful platform uh we use

02:50:33,359 --> 02:50:38,080
github actions

02:50:34,479 --> 02:50:41,200
not just for automating things but also

02:50:38,080 --> 02:50:42,640
for scheduling cron jobs and then we use

02:50:41,200 --> 02:50:45,680
github pages to deploy

02:50:42,640 --> 02:50:48,319
our website uh this literally means that

02:50:45,680 --> 02:50:50,479
we don't need a server we have no

02:50:48,319 --> 02:50:54,240
digital ocean droplet or whatever

02:50:50,479 --> 02:50:56,960
ec2 instance um because the idea is

02:50:54,240 --> 02:50:57,520
all of our programmatic uh you know

02:50:56,960 --> 02:51:00,160
tooling

02:50:57,520 --> 02:51:02,000
generation build time stuff is happening

02:51:00,160 --> 02:51:04,160
in a github actions workflow

02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:05,840
and so this is very powerful because if

02:51:04,160 --> 02:51:07,439
you have an open source repo you get

02:51:05,840 --> 02:51:09,279
unlimited free minutes

02:51:07,439 --> 02:51:11,359
which means all of the other non-profits

02:51:09,279 --> 02:51:13,200
that we work with can get all of these

02:51:11,359 --> 02:51:15,600
great systems in place

02:51:13,200 --> 02:51:17,279
literally completely for free running in

02:51:15,600 --> 02:51:18,000
github actions workflow rather than

02:51:17,279 --> 02:51:19,920
using

02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:21,359
uh you know specific servers that you

02:51:19,920 --> 02:51:23,600
have to pay for and so

02:51:21,359 --> 02:51:25,760
the idea was that with our guides where

02:51:23,600 --> 02:51:26,880
we've thoroughly documented everything

02:51:25,760 --> 02:51:29,680
that we're working on

02:51:26,880 --> 02:51:30,960
and with our source code uh we don't

02:51:29,680 --> 02:51:32,880
want it to stop here

02:51:30,960 --> 02:51:34,800
that we're done with our part we want to

02:51:32,880 --> 02:51:36,560
make sure that other non-profits and

02:51:34,800 --> 02:51:38,479
other people can build on top of it

02:51:36,560 --> 02:51:39,760
and then make sure that we all do our

02:51:38,479 --> 02:51:42,479
little part uh

02:51:39,760 --> 02:51:42,479
to giving back

02:51:42,960 --> 02:51:47,520
makes sense and i think uh you you

02:51:45,279 --> 02:51:49,359
highlighted a good point around how uh

02:51:47,520 --> 02:51:51,840
grab actions really

02:51:49,359 --> 02:51:52,960
takes away a lot of the burden of you

02:51:51,840 --> 02:51:55,120
know uh

02:51:52,960 --> 02:51:57,359
maintaining servers and you know with

02:51:55,120 --> 02:52:01,120
the compute being with github

02:51:57,359 --> 02:52:04,479
it enables people to quickly be able to

02:52:01,120 --> 02:52:05,520
really put their um uh you could say you

02:52:04,479 --> 02:52:09,279
know their logic

02:52:05,520 --> 02:52:12,880
into action you know and um so so that's

02:52:09,279 --> 02:52:16,240
a really great point to highlight and um

02:52:12,880 --> 02:52:19,200
so so you know a lot of us uh

02:52:16,240 --> 02:52:19,920
you know we we all want to help others

02:52:19,200 --> 02:52:22,800
and we

02:52:19,920 --> 02:52:24,240
all have ideas about it or maybe the

02:52:22,800 --> 02:52:27,120
desire to help

02:52:24,240 --> 02:52:27,760
but not everyone is able to convert that

02:52:27,120 --> 02:52:31,120
into

02:52:27,760 --> 02:52:31,760
into action and uh any words of advice

02:52:31,120 --> 02:52:34,479
from you

02:52:31,760 --> 02:52:34,880
uh for others you know who who really

02:52:34,479 --> 02:52:37,920
wants

02:52:34,880 --> 02:52:40,080
to give back and you know um

02:52:37,920 --> 02:52:42,640
you know what does it take to really

02:52:40,080 --> 02:52:45,520
take that the first critical step

02:52:42,640 --> 02:52:45,920
or what have been some things that have

02:52:45,520 --> 02:52:49,200
uh

02:52:45,920 --> 02:52:52,240
been um important in uh enabling you to

02:52:49,200 --> 02:52:54,080
succeed in your efforts

02:52:52,240 --> 02:52:55,600
i think this is kind of a two-way thing

02:52:54,080 --> 02:52:57,200
right there's

02:52:55,600 --> 02:52:59,120
how do you start right you start by

02:52:57,200 --> 02:53:00,240
starting and that's what we did you know

02:52:59,120 --> 02:53:03,359
we didn't have

02:53:00,240 --> 02:53:03,920
a big distribution center or ideas of

02:53:03,359 --> 02:53:06,000
what

02:53:03,920 --> 02:53:08,160
we want to do in the future but we just

02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:09,760
started with the open source project

02:53:08,160 --> 02:53:11,359
and and thought about okay how do we

02:53:09,760 --> 02:53:13,600
take it forward from here

02:53:11,359 --> 02:53:14,479
um and and i like to start all of my

02:53:13,600 --> 02:53:16,720
projects like that

02:53:14,479 --> 02:53:19,120
if you have a you know idea you build a

02:53:16,720 --> 02:53:20,960
repo quickly and just think about it

02:53:19,120 --> 02:53:22,880
and then you kind of take it forward

02:53:20,960 --> 02:53:23,680
slowly over you know days and weeks and

02:53:22,880 --> 02:53:27,040
years

02:53:23,680 --> 02:53:30,240
uh so you know the gatekeeping is

02:53:27,040 --> 02:53:30,800
non-existent now uh i because if you

02:53:30,240 --> 02:53:33,279
look at

02:53:30,800 --> 02:53:34,960
any project like we saw already in

02:53:33,279 --> 02:53:36,240
github satellite there are so many great

02:53:34,960 --> 02:53:38,800
open source projects

02:53:36,240 --> 02:53:40,240
that all started as a tiny idea and you

02:53:38,800 --> 02:53:40,960
want to build it into an open source

02:53:40,240 --> 02:53:42,640
product

02:53:40,960 --> 02:53:44,640
and if you want to contribute to them

02:53:42,640 --> 02:53:46,240
it's become easier than ever

02:53:44,640 --> 02:53:48,240
right there are so many great guides out

02:53:46,240 --> 02:53:49,279
there about how do you make your first

02:53:48,240 --> 02:53:51,680
pull request

02:53:49,279 --> 02:53:52,399
uh and and there are concepts like good

02:53:51,680 --> 02:53:55,439
first

02:53:52,399 --> 02:53:57,200
um good first issue or up for grabs

02:53:55,439 --> 02:53:58,160
where you could filter out issues that

02:53:57,200 --> 02:53:59,600
need help

02:53:58,160 --> 02:54:01,760
and i think you know the best way is

02:53:59,600 --> 02:54:03,840
just to get started uh and

02:54:01,760 --> 02:54:05,439
you know i'm saying this because usually

02:54:03,840 --> 02:54:06,240
people watching get up satellite or

02:54:05,439 --> 02:54:08,160
technical

02:54:06,240 --> 02:54:09,840
and the best way to give back could be

02:54:08,160 --> 02:54:11,600
spend a little bit of your time

02:54:09,840 --> 02:54:13,520
in giving back to open source projects

02:54:11,600 --> 02:54:15,279
that you use or open source projects

02:54:13,520 --> 02:54:17,680
like ours that are trying to

02:54:15,279 --> 02:54:19,600
help people during the pandemic but the

02:54:17,680 --> 02:54:22,080
second part is really about the

02:54:19,600 --> 02:54:24,080
the distribution and the manual work

02:54:22,080 --> 02:54:26,160
right you can give your time away

02:54:24,080 --> 02:54:27,120
you could volunteer to projects but i

02:54:26,160 --> 02:54:30,479
think

02:54:27,120 --> 02:54:32,560
you know because for us personally it's

02:54:30,479 --> 02:54:34,080
it's really about privilege right it's

02:54:32,560 --> 02:54:34,720
about the fact that we've been in

02:54:34,080 --> 02:54:38,160
lockdown

02:54:34,720 --> 02:54:39,040
uh for a year now and and not much has

02:54:38,160 --> 02:54:41,040
changed

02:54:39,040 --> 02:54:42,240
uh you know i i go to work every day

02:54:41,040 --> 02:54:45,279
from my laptop

02:54:42,240 --> 02:54:47,200
um i get a good salary i i

02:54:45,279 --> 02:54:49,279
write code i contribute to open source

02:54:47,200 --> 02:54:51,840
projects but there are so many

02:54:49,279 --> 02:54:53,359
not just tens or hundreds but thousands

02:54:51,840 --> 02:54:54,080
and tens of thousands of people out

02:54:53,359 --> 02:54:56,080
there

02:54:54,080 --> 02:54:58,000
whose experience has been completely

02:54:56,080 --> 02:55:00,240
different like i said in the beginning

02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:01,520
migrant workers here in delhi who don't

02:55:00,240 --> 02:55:02,800
know how they're going gonna feed their

02:55:01,520 --> 02:55:05,200
family tomorrow

02:55:02,800 --> 02:55:06,560
uh maybe today but just because the

02:55:05,200 --> 02:55:08,240
entire job was

02:55:06,560 --> 02:55:09,760
of the idea that every day we're gonna

02:55:08,240 --> 02:55:10,319
do a little bit of work on a little bit

02:55:09,760 --> 02:55:12,720
of money

02:55:10,319 --> 02:55:13,439
and then somebody takes that away from

02:55:12,720 --> 02:55:16,240
you

02:55:13,439 --> 02:55:18,000
uh so i think it's not just about the

02:55:16,240 --> 02:55:18,560
technical part of making your first pull

02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:20,319
request

02:55:18,560 --> 02:55:22,160
although that could be very powerful as

02:55:20,319 --> 02:55:24,319
well it's about

02:55:22,160 --> 02:55:26,479
how can you look at your tool kit right

02:55:24,319 --> 02:55:28,000
are you a designer or a teacher or a

02:55:26,479 --> 02:55:29,840
student or an engineer

02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:31,120
and what you know how to do and how can

02:55:29,840 --> 02:55:33,840
you use those tools

02:55:31,120 --> 02:55:35,359
as a way to give back and i do your

02:55:33,840 --> 02:55:37,359
little part right because

02:55:35,359 --> 02:55:38,399
when you're talking about this scale

02:55:37,359 --> 02:55:41,279
this pandemic

02:55:38,399 --> 02:55:42,720
and so many people uh who we can do

02:55:41,279 --> 02:55:44,000
something for and who we should have

02:55:42,720 --> 02:55:45,920
empathy for

02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:47,439
every little bit helps and i think

02:55:45,920 --> 02:55:48,720
that's why you know i started by saying

02:55:47,439 --> 02:55:50,720
just start by starting

02:55:48,720 --> 02:55:52,080
do your little part because we're like

02:55:50,720 --> 02:55:53,920
tiny compared to

02:55:52,080 --> 02:55:55,200
all of these great open source projects

02:55:53,920 --> 02:55:56,800
out there and you know with

02:55:55,200 --> 02:55:58,479
tens of thousands of contributors

02:55:56,800 --> 02:56:01,680
working from around the world

02:55:58,479 --> 02:56:03,120
uh and and of one common good uh one

02:56:01,680 --> 02:56:04,960
common goal that you know

02:56:03,120 --> 02:56:06,560
there's a pandemic and we can spend our

02:56:04,960 --> 02:56:07,600
free time and do our little part on

02:56:06,560 --> 02:56:09,359
giving back

02:56:07,600 --> 02:56:12,000
uh and so i think you just start by

02:56:09,359 --> 02:56:14,479
starting uh look at what's out there and

02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:16,640
you know contact people see how you can

02:56:14,479 --> 02:56:19,760
make your first pull request or

02:56:16,640 --> 02:56:21,680
or volunteer or give a little and like i

02:56:19,760 --> 02:56:24,319
said you know we're a tiny part of it

02:56:21,680 --> 02:56:25,120
but uh every part really counts and so

02:56:24,319 --> 02:56:26,399
you know i would say

02:56:25,120 --> 02:56:29,120
you shouldn't be you shouldn't feel

02:56:26,399 --> 02:56:31,600
hesitated at all just start by starting

02:56:29,120 --> 02:56:32,399
uh do your little bit and then see you

02:56:31,600 --> 02:56:35,279
know what kind of

02:56:32,399 --> 02:56:36,640
impact it can do for us it was like a

02:56:35,279 --> 02:56:39,120
tiny open source project

02:56:36,640 --> 02:56:40,000
one repo and then literally tens of

02:56:39,120 --> 02:56:42,000
thousands of people

02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:43,680
now not being hungry hundreds of

02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:45,600
thousands of masks to

02:56:43,680 --> 02:56:46,960
frontline health workers to police

02:56:45,600 --> 02:56:49,040
personnel uh

02:56:46,960 --> 02:56:50,319
all in a matter of just weeks just

02:56:49,040 --> 02:56:53,520
because we started

02:56:50,319 --> 02:56:54,720
uh yeah makes sense anand

02:56:53,520 --> 02:56:56,160
that makes a lot of sense and i'm just

02:56:54,720 --> 02:56:56,960
going to echo sort of what you said

02:56:56,160 --> 02:57:00,319
which is

02:56:56,960 --> 02:57:00,880
that first of all no effort is you know

02:57:00,319 --> 02:57:03,120
um

02:57:00,880 --> 02:57:04,399
is is small it's like every little thing

02:57:03,120 --> 02:57:06,640
that each of us

02:57:04,399 --> 02:57:08,160
is good at uh we can use that to

02:57:06,640 --> 02:57:10,880
contribute in some way or the other

02:57:08,160 --> 02:57:12,880
and today uh in the uh you know in the

02:57:10,880 --> 02:57:14,560
world we have platforms like github that

02:57:12,880 --> 02:57:17,680
make it so much easier

02:57:14,560 --> 02:57:19,840
for people to um meet with

02:57:17,680 --> 02:57:21,120
other other people in the community and

02:57:19,840 --> 02:57:22,399
you don't necessarily have to start

02:57:21,120 --> 02:57:24,720
something from scratch

02:57:22,399 --> 02:57:26,479
you can join an existing effort because

02:57:24,720 --> 02:57:27,600
something that you do can contribute and

02:57:26,479 --> 02:57:30,960
add value

02:57:27,600 --> 02:57:33,840
and uh really it's a great way to

02:57:30,960 --> 02:57:35,040
uh to learn and share and along the way

02:57:33,840 --> 02:57:37,040
to do some good

02:57:35,040 --> 02:57:39,040
so um it's this you know your story

02:57:37,040 --> 02:57:39,600
annan has been very inspiring to me for

02:57:39,040 --> 02:57:40,960
sure

02:57:39,600 --> 02:57:43,520
and i hope that it's going to be the

02:57:40,960 --> 02:57:44,880
same for many others a great opportunity

02:57:43,520 --> 02:57:47,279
to use their

02:57:44,880 --> 02:57:48,160
technical abilities or whatever are

02:57:47,279 --> 02:57:51,040
their core uh

02:57:48,160 --> 02:57:51,600
competencies and you know um contribute

02:57:51,040 --> 02:57:55,120
um

02:57:51,600 --> 02:57:56,800
and uh really start like you said

02:57:55,120 --> 02:57:58,800
um it has been a pleasure talking to you

02:57:56,800 --> 02:58:00,720
ananth your story definitely serves as

02:57:58,800 --> 02:58:03,120
an example to so many others

02:58:00,720 --> 02:58:05,359
and it's great to see that you you you

02:58:03,120 --> 02:58:07,359
started you put this into action and you

findings of our recently done report but

03:05:39,040 --> 03:05:43,840
before that quick introduction about me

03:05:41,120 --> 03:05:46,240
and civic data lab so i'm going honey

03:05:43,840 --> 03:05:46,880
i'm director co-founder at civic data

03:05:46,240 --> 03:05:48,640
lab

03:05:46,880 --> 03:05:51,040
civic data lab works with the goal of

03:05:48,640 --> 03:05:52,720
connecting data tech design and social

03:05:51,040 --> 03:05:54,800
science to strengthen civic engagements

03:05:52,720 --> 03:05:56,880
in the country and how we do it

03:05:54,800 --> 03:05:58,160
is actually a two-pronged approach first

03:05:56,880 --> 03:06:00,560
improving access to

03:05:58,160 --> 03:06:01,359
information majorly public information

03:06:00,560 --> 03:06:03,520
using

03:06:01,359 --> 03:06:04,560
free and open source software tools and

03:06:03,520 --> 03:06:06,960
platform

03:06:04,560 --> 03:06:07,760
and once citizens have the right access

03:06:06,960 --> 03:06:09,760
to information

03:06:07,760 --> 03:06:11,840
in their hands how they can meaningfully

03:06:09,760 --> 03:06:14,000
participate in governance in local

03:06:11,840 --> 03:06:16,080
issues in their democracy

03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:17,680
so that's how civic data lab works and

03:06:16,080 --> 03:06:19,359
we work very closely with

03:06:17,680 --> 03:06:20,880
government agencies research

03:06:19,359 --> 03:06:23,359
organizations civil society

03:06:20,880 --> 03:06:26,479
organizations media etc

03:06:23,359 --> 03:06:27,359
to grow their data and tech capacity so

03:06:26,479 --> 03:06:30,640
it's very

03:06:27,359 --> 03:06:32,240
uh important and uh for us to understand

03:06:30,640 --> 03:06:33,359
the growth of free and open source

03:06:32,240 --> 03:06:36,160
software in the country

03:06:33,359 --> 03:06:37,200
and how we can play a major role in

03:06:36,160 --> 03:06:39,279
helping these

03:06:37,200 --> 03:06:40,640
different stakeholders work towards a

03:06:39,279 --> 03:06:44,880
common shared vision

03:06:40,640 --> 03:06:48,240
of increasing india's digital ecosystem

03:06:44,880 --> 03:06:50,319
so we did this report uh uh with the

03:06:48,240 --> 03:06:52,240
support of omedya network india we

03:06:50,319 --> 03:06:53,840
interviewed close to 51 first

03:06:52,240 --> 03:06:57,920
researchers practitioners

03:06:53,840 --> 03:06:59,520
across the nation um did analysis of 63

03:06:57,920 --> 03:07:01,040
case studies on free and open source

03:06:59,520 --> 03:07:03,279
software

03:07:01,040 --> 03:07:04,640
read another 26 reports which were on

03:07:03,279 --> 03:07:07,200
the similar topic

03:07:04,640 --> 03:07:08,560
and framed our thoughts towards the

03:07:07,200 --> 03:07:09,760
whole free and open source software

03:07:08,560 --> 03:07:12,479
ecosystem

03:07:09,760 --> 03:07:12,880
presented our findings and requested

03:07:12,479 --> 03:07:15,439
eight

03:07:12,880 --> 03:07:16,479
eminent uh experts from the community to

03:07:15,439 --> 03:07:19,760
review the whole

03:07:16,479 --> 03:07:21,600
work so just just

03:07:19,760 --> 03:07:23,680
just to get the basics right how we are

03:07:21,600 --> 03:07:25,520
defining foss so pre and open source

03:07:23,680 --> 03:07:27,040
software is a software that is freely

03:07:25,520 --> 03:07:30,319
licensed to use

03:07:27,040 --> 03:07:32,640
uh study change improve contribute upon

03:07:30,319 --> 03:07:33,920
basically a piece of code which you can

03:07:32,640 --> 03:07:37,120
make it break it

03:07:33,920 --> 03:07:39,840
uh find different aspects of usage of it

03:07:37,120 --> 03:07:41,200
and customize it contextualize it based

03:07:39,840 --> 03:07:43,120
on your needs

03:07:41,200 --> 03:07:44,960
we are referring fos as an inclusive

03:07:43,120 --> 03:07:45,520
term covering both the free software

03:07:44,960 --> 03:07:47,840
moment

03:07:45,520 --> 03:07:50,080
and the open source software world

03:07:47,840 --> 03:07:51,840
despite their

03:07:50,080 --> 03:07:53,279
despite having different cultures and

03:07:51,840 --> 03:07:55,120
ownerships they have

03:07:53,279 --> 03:07:56,640
similar ownership models and that's what

03:07:55,120 --> 03:07:58,000
we are going to focus on

03:07:56,640 --> 03:07:59,920
so that's where we have taken more

03:07:58,000 --> 03:08:02,000
inclusive approach of free and open

03:07:59,920 --> 03:08:04,240
source software

03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:06,080
so india runs on false you won't believe

03:08:04,240 --> 03:08:08,800
more than 85 percent

03:08:06,080 --> 03:08:10,640
websites web servers are running on free

03:08:08,800 --> 03:08:13,359
and open source software

03:08:10,640 --> 03:08:14,960
uh most of this uh is something that you

03:08:13,359 --> 03:08:19,120
might be using daily but might

03:08:14,960 --> 03:08:20,800
but not be aware of so uh irctc uses

03:08:19,120 --> 03:08:22,479
a lot of free and open source software

03:08:20,800 --> 03:08:25,040
to help us do ticketing

03:08:22,479 --> 03:08:27,040
train ticketing on time uh supreme code

03:08:25,040 --> 03:08:28,000
of india uses free and open source

03:08:27,040 --> 03:08:30,960
software

03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:31,840
to do docker management of all the cases

03:08:30,960 --> 03:08:35,600
and

03:08:31,840 --> 03:08:38,479
help us do hearings at time

03:08:35,600 --> 03:08:40,479
lic india also uses free and open source

03:08:38,479 --> 03:08:41,680
software to ensure life insurance are

03:08:40,479 --> 03:08:44,640
done at scale

03:08:41,680 --> 03:08:46,240
uh also bombay stock exchange help us do

03:08:44,640 --> 03:08:48,080
stock trading

03:08:46,240 --> 03:08:49,840
at scale using free and open source

03:08:48,080 --> 03:08:52,000
software all of them

03:08:49,840 --> 03:08:53,520
are using free and open source software

03:08:52,000 --> 03:08:55,920
but most of them

03:08:53,520 --> 03:08:57,439
uh don't advertise it so we don't know

03:08:55,920 --> 03:08:58,319
that they are running on finer prints or

03:08:57,439 --> 03:09:00,240
software

03:08:58,319 --> 03:09:01,439
and very few of them actually contribute

03:09:00,240 --> 03:09:03,120
back in open source

03:09:01,439 --> 03:09:05,439
that's where it becomes a bit more

03:09:03,120 --> 03:09:08,080
tricky for us to participate

03:09:05,439 --> 03:09:10,160
uh with them so imagine given our

03:09:08,080 --> 03:09:12,640
developer community given all of you

03:09:10,160 --> 03:09:14,240
and the amazing talent out there if we

03:09:12,640 --> 03:09:17,120
could have created an open source

03:09:14,240 --> 03:09:18,800
ticketing system uh it would have gone

03:09:17,120 --> 03:09:21,359
quite viral with the kind of different

03:09:18,800 --> 03:09:23,520
use cases we would have created in india

03:09:21,359 --> 03:09:26,160
as well as outside so that's what this

03:09:23,520 --> 03:09:28,720
report is all about

03:09:26,160 --> 03:09:29,439
so to look into how the force ecosystem

03:09:28,720 --> 03:09:32,000
has grown

03:09:29,439 --> 03:09:33,840
we have to look into the timeline uh so

03:09:32,000 --> 03:09:35,760
we have divided the growth of free and

03:09:33,840 --> 03:09:37,120
open source software so far into six

03:09:35,760 --> 03:09:39,600
major eras

03:09:37,120 --> 03:09:42,880
number one is the inception of force uh

03:09:39,600 --> 03:09:45,680
which is basically in 1886 to 1978

03:09:42,880 --> 03:09:47,439
where the whole new initiatives of free

03:09:45,680 --> 03:09:50,319
and open source software happened

03:09:47,439 --> 03:09:51,840
discussions on copyright were there etc

03:09:50,319 --> 03:09:54,479
which gradually uh

03:09:51,840 --> 03:09:55,520
led to the rise of free software moment

03:09:54,479 --> 03:09:57,680
uh

03:09:55,520 --> 03:09:59,120
the moment was led by richard stallman

03:09:57,680 --> 03:10:02,560
and other people

03:09:59,120 --> 03:10:05,600
from 1978 to 1989 shaping what the free

03:10:02,560 --> 03:10:06,960
software ecosystem looks like today

03:10:05,600 --> 03:10:09,120
and then the rise of community

03:10:06,960 --> 03:10:11,120
businesses happened with the discussions

03:10:09,120 --> 03:10:14,000
on open source and how

03:10:11,120 --> 03:10:16,239
open source can help co-create software

03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:18,880
in collaboration with other actors

03:10:16,239 --> 03:10:19,920
geographically distributed organizations

03:10:18,880 --> 03:10:21,359
working on different

03:10:19,920 --> 03:10:23,600
kind of problems but similar

03:10:21,359 --> 03:10:25,680
technological needs

03:10:23,600 --> 03:10:28,080
then there are three parallel errors the

03:10:25,680 --> 03:10:30,479
number one is the big tech fights back

03:10:28,080 --> 03:10:33,279
uh the open source uh which started from

03:10:30,479 --> 03:10:35,760
1998 but gradually the big tech

03:10:33,279 --> 03:10:37,279
uh found uh the benefits of free and

03:10:35,760 --> 03:10:38,160
open source software quite helpful for

03:10:37,279 --> 03:10:41,200
them so

03:10:38,160 --> 03:10:44,479
around 2008 the dust has settled on that

03:10:41,200 --> 03:10:46,000
um from 1999 onwards we have seen global

03:10:44,479 --> 03:10:47,680
proliferation of free and open source

03:10:46,000 --> 03:10:49,279
software with a lot of communities

03:10:47,680 --> 03:10:52,560
coming to even india

03:10:49,279 --> 03:10:54,479
uh working and co-creating together with

03:10:52,560 --> 03:10:56,239
different stakeholders on how different

03:10:54,479 --> 03:10:59,359
open source libraries

03:10:56,239 --> 03:11:01,520
projects can be scaled and expansion in

03:10:59,359 --> 03:11:03,279
india of course have grown from 2001

03:11:01,520 --> 03:11:04,880
onwards and which i'm going to deep dive

03:11:03,279 --> 03:11:07,279
much more in detail

03:11:04,880 --> 03:11:09,840
so uh we used to have annual conferences

03:11:07,279 --> 03:11:12,160
like foss.n led by atul chutness

03:11:09,840 --> 03:11:14,319
bringing in a community of false

03:11:12,160 --> 03:11:15,520
practitioners together discussing

03:11:14,319 --> 03:11:18,160
how free and open source software

03:11:15,520 --> 03:11:21,120
ecosystem can grow together we also saw

03:11:18,160 --> 03:11:21,600
it at school project started by kerala

03:11:21,120 --> 03:11:24,800
early

03:11:21,600 --> 03:11:26,560
in 2001 where they tried to deploy free

03:11:24,800 --> 03:11:28,399
and open source software in more than 12

03:11:26,560 --> 03:11:30,000
000 public schools and they have scaled

03:11:28,399 --> 03:11:31,840
fantastically

03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:33,840
we have also seen government of india

03:11:31,840 --> 03:11:35,600
starting nrc foss which is national

03:11:33,840 --> 03:11:37,040
resource center for free and open source

03:11:35,600 --> 03:11:39,600
software

03:11:37,040 --> 03:11:41,120
which has picked up in increasing more

03:11:39,600 --> 03:11:45,040
government acceptance of

03:11:41,120 --> 03:11:46,000
a force in their usage uh similarly we

03:11:45,040 --> 03:11:48,560
started to see

03:11:46,000 --> 03:11:50,880
states making some efforts kerala again

03:11:48,560 --> 03:11:53,120
started icfos which is an international

03:11:50,880 --> 03:11:54,720
center for free and open source software

03:11:53,120 --> 03:11:57,040
looking for fostering research and

03:11:54,720 --> 03:11:57,600
collaboration on how softwares could be

03:11:57,040 --> 03:11:59,680
created

03:11:57,600 --> 03:12:01,520
with the help of communities academia

03:11:59,680 --> 03:12:04,399
and other stakeholders

03:12:01,520 --> 03:12:05,760
we also saw starting of groups like sflc

03:12:04,399 --> 03:12:08,160
which talks about the

03:12:05,760 --> 03:12:10,080
licensing the policy the legal aspects

03:12:08,160 --> 03:12:12,800
of free and open source software

03:12:10,080 --> 03:12:14,960
and more and more supreme courts uh

03:12:12,800 --> 03:12:16,560
supreme court establishment high courts

03:12:14,960 --> 03:12:18,000
lower courts moving towards free and

03:12:16,560 --> 03:12:20,479
open source software

03:12:18,000 --> 03:12:21,120
so there has been quite a lot going on

03:12:20,479 --> 03:12:23,040
and

03:12:21,120 --> 03:12:24,720
gradually what we are seeing is more

03:12:23,040 --> 03:12:26,560
businesses are evolving

03:12:24,720 --> 03:12:28,560
uh keeping free and open source software

03:12:26,560 --> 03:12:32,560
as core to their business model

03:12:28,560 --> 03:12:34,560
we have seen zero dha chat vote hasura

03:12:32,560 --> 03:12:36,399
running their business operations using

03:12:34,560 --> 03:12:37,840
free and open source software helping

03:12:36,399 --> 03:12:41,600
other businesses scale up

03:12:37,840 --> 03:12:44,160
as well so what this leads to

03:12:41,600 --> 03:12:44,640
is major false opportunities for us in

03:12:44,160 --> 03:12:46,640
india

03:12:44,640 --> 03:12:48,080
the number one is technical growth where

03:12:46,640 --> 03:12:49,920
we have an opportunity to become a

03:12:48,080 --> 03:12:52,239
global technology leader

03:12:49,920 --> 03:12:54,000
in emerging technologies which are very

03:12:52,239 --> 03:12:56,080
fast driven like artificial

03:12:54,000 --> 03:12:57,439
intelligence big data machine learning

03:12:56,080 --> 03:12:59,200
and so on the

03:12:57,439 --> 03:13:00,640
enormous amount of talent in india is

03:12:59,200 --> 03:13:03,520
quite focused to

03:13:00,640 --> 03:13:05,120
build libraries and packages on free and

03:13:03,520 --> 03:13:07,680
open source software and see

03:13:05,120 --> 03:13:08,640
how they can scale up the growth so we

03:13:07,680 --> 03:13:11,120
need to invest

03:13:08,640 --> 03:13:13,040
more on seeing how this could be

03:13:11,120 --> 03:13:14,000
catalyzed and there could be a strategic

03:13:13,040 --> 03:13:15,760
mission on

03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:18,800
moving forward with the new emerging

03:13:15,760 --> 03:13:20,640
tech second one is the economic growth

03:13:18,800 --> 03:13:22,560
with free and open source software and

03:13:20,640 --> 03:13:24,319
the ability to contextualize

03:13:22,560 --> 03:13:26,160
and localize the software we can

03:13:24,319 --> 03:13:28,560
drastically include

03:13:26,160 --> 03:13:29,359
improve the financial inclusion in the

03:13:28,560 --> 03:13:33,120
country

03:13:29,359 --> 03:13:36,239
helping more young internet users

03:13:33,120 --> 03:13:38,720
use internet to rely on better public

03:13:36,239 --> 03:13:40,640
digital services better digital services

03:13:38,720 --> 03:13:42,239
out there to

03:13:40,640 --> 03:13:44,160
help resolve some of the issues they

03:13:42,239 --> 03:13:45,279
face in their locality and lastly the

03:13:44,160 --> 03:13:47,120
talent growth

03:13:45,279 --> 03:13:49,920
i mean we are creating a common base

03:13:47,120 --> 03:13:53,520
approach of uh creating knowledge pool

03:13:49,920 --> 03:13:56,239
of resources be it data be it languages

03:13:53,520 --> 03:13:57,520
be a different variety of local lived

03:13:56,239 --> 03:13:59,600
experiences

03:13:57,520 --> 03:14:01,760
all of it are proliferating in this

03:13:59,600 --> 03:14:03,279
software ecosystem with the help of free

03:14:01,760 --> 03:14:06,239
and open source software

03:14:03,279 --> 03:14:08,160
so a lot could be done when it comes to

03:14:06,239 --> 03:14:10,479
growing the forest ecosystem

03:14:08,160 --> 03:14:11,840
and these stakeholders these four of

03:14:10,479 --> 03:14:14,399
them are key

03:14:11,840 --> 03:14:15,680
in moving forward the secret system the

03:14:14,399 --> 03:14:18,880
number one are of course

03:14:15,680 --> 03:14:20,640
you people uh the community of free and

03:14:18,880 --> 03:14:21,840
open source software practitioners

03:14:20,640 --> 03:14:24,080
researchers

03:14:21,840 --> 03:14:25,920
we have got a lot of them on a national

03:14:24,080 --> 03:14:27,600
and local level in india

03:14:25,920 --> 03:14:30,239
the second one is the educational

03:14:27,600 --> 03:14:34,000
institutes like iit bombay

03:14:30,239 --> 03:14:36,239
uh triple it hyderabad iise bangalore

03:14:34,000 --> 03:14:38,720
all of them are now trying to have fast

03:14:36,239 --> 03:14:41,600
cells even schools and colleges

03:14:38,720 --> 03:14:43,279
uh from tier two tier three places have

03:14:41,600 --> 03:14:43,600
free and open source software related

03:14:43,279 --> 03:14:46,560
some

03:14:43,600 --> 03:14:48,479
education literacy hobby groups there

03:14:46,560 --> 03:14:50,319
false businesses some of them i

03:14:48,479 --> 03:14:53,279
recently occurred like zero the chat

03:14:50,319 --> 03:14:56,800
foot and all and even the msmes

03:14:53,279 --> 03:14:58,399
who are new emerging uh uh technology

03:14:56,800 --> 03:15:00,560
partners are now looking

03:14:58,399 --> 03:15:01,840
for free and open source alternatives

03:15:00,560 --> 03:15:03,600
and lastly the governments

03:15:01,840 --> 03:15:05,600
national local and regional governments

03:15:03,600 --> 03:15:06,000
are also moving more towards free and

03:15:05,600 --> 03:15:08,239
open source

03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:09,600
software so we're going to look into all

03:15:08,239 --> 03:15:10,800
four of them

03:15:09,600 --> 03:15:13,120
and the lens through which we are

03:15:10,800 --> 03:15:14,000
looking at is very simple four step

03:15:13,120 --> 03:15:16,640
growth

03:15:14,000 --> 03:15:18,399
the first step is build capacity build

03:15:16,640 --> 03:15:20,560
capacity to understand what kind of free

03:15:18,399 --> 03:15:22,560
and open source software is out there

03:15:20,560 --> 03:15:23,600
consume ethically work with different

03:15:22,560 --> 03:15:26,239
stakeholders

03:15:23,600 --> 03:15:27,359
to see what kind of licenses you can use

03:15:26,239 --> 03:15:28,720
to improve

03:15:27,359 --> 03:15:31,439
the growth of free and open source

03:15:28,720 --> 03:15:33,520
software uh what kind of

03:15:31,439 --> 03:15:34,960
libraries packages are out there which

03:15:33,520 --> 03:15:37,279
can benefit you

03:15:34,960 --> 03:15:39,120
uh contribute regularly once you have

03:15:37,279 --> 03:15:40,399
built the right pace you are consuming

03:15:39,120 --> 03:15:42,399
it right

03:15:40,399 --> 03:15:44,239
start contributing regularly start

03:15:42,399 --> 03:15:46,080
opening up issues start

03:15:44,239 --> 03:15:48,560
working with the community to find new

03:15:46,080 --> 03:15:49,920
features start participating in the

03:15:48,560 --> 03:15:52,399
development sprints

03:15:49,920 --> 03:15:54,000
uh and the communities out there to who

03:15:52,399 --> 03:15:56,239
are volunteering their time to make the

03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:58,319
software ecosystem better with you

03:15:56,239 --> 03:15:59,680
and lastly once you have started to

03:15:58,319 --> 03:16:01,920
contribute regularly

03:15:59,680 --> 03:16:03,040
it's time to go collaborate and

03:16:01,920 --> 03:16:06,640
co-create and

03:16:03,040 --> 03:16:08,160
grow so have big plans for how these

03:16:06,640 --> 03:16:10,880
softwares can grow

03:16:08,160 --> 03:16:12,479
beyond one sector beyond one problem

03:16:10,880 --> 03:16:14,160
scale to other domains

03:16:12,479 --> 03:16:17,040
other areas in which this could be

03:16:14,160 --> 03:16:19,760
scaled up so that's how we are seeing

03:16:17,040 --> 03:16:20,800
foresees growth for all the different

03:16:19,760 --> 03:16:24,800
stakeholders

03:16:20,800 --> 03:16:26,720
present in the fos ecosystem

03:16:24,800 --> 03:16:28,479
the number one rf community is my

03:16:26,720 --> 03:16:31,120
favorite one so

03:16:28,479 --> 03:16:32,960
i think one thing which we all are uh

03:16:31,120 --> 03:16:34,479
facing as a challenge is the initial

03:16:32,960 --> 03:16:37,840
barriers itself

03:16:34,479 --> 03:16:40,080
uh for anyone who is trying to work uh

03:16:37,840 --> 03:16:41,840
in the pre-enterprise software who is

03:16:40,080 --> 03:16:43,600
interested to contribute

03:16:41,840 --> 03:16:45,120
there are certain initial barriers which

03:16:43,600 --> 03:16:47,760
we have all faced

03:16:45,120 --> 03:16:48,720
uh let's try figure out how we can curb

03:16:47,760 --> 03:16:51,200
some of these

03:16:48,720 --> 03:16:52,800
for the new upcoming talent so things

03:16:51,200 --> 03:16:54,640
like having leadership programs

03:16:52,800 --> 03:16:56,319
mentorship programs like google summer

03:16:54,640 --> 03:16:59,359
of code really helps

03:16:56,319 --> 03:17:01,920
bring new talent to the existing big

03:16:59,359 --> 03:17:02,960
free and open source software ecosystems

03:17:01,920 --> 03:17:05,279
um

03:17:02,960 --> 03:17:06,479
investing more on that uh would be

03:17:05,279 --> 03:17:08,319
really helpful

03:17:06,479 --> 03:17:10,160
helping with working with the academia

03:17:08,319 --> 03:17:12,319
to find more such important

03:17:10,160 --> 03:17:14,239
opportunities to groom the upcoming

03:17:12,319 --> 03:17:17,520
false talent is something which we

03:17:14,239 --> 03:17:20,560
highly advise second one is uh

03:17:17,520 --> 03:17:22,319
having more diversity and inclusivity

03:17:20,560 --> 03:17:24,160
we have seen uh most of the false

03:17:22,319 --> 03:17:26,080
communities are

03:17:24,160 --> 03:17:27,760
underrepresented by different

03:17:26,080 --> 03:17:29,840
marginalized groups

03:17:27,760 --> 03:17:31,520
increasing representation of different

03:17:29,840 --> 03:17:33,279
groups is very essential

03:17:31,520 --> 03:17:35,760
not just to build a thriving fast

03:17:33,279 --> 03:17:38,800
ecosystem but also to

03:17:35,760 --> 03:17:39,600
build robust software if more people are

03:17:38,800 --> 03:17:41,279
involved

03:17:39,600 --> 03:17:43,040
most likely the software would be

03:17:41,279 --> 03:17:45,920
beneficial for all

03:17:43,040 --> 03:17:47,600
so uh programs like outreachy are quite

03:17:45,920 --> 03:17:50,560
helpful for us to

03:17:47,600 --> 03:17:52,080
move in that direction third one is

03:17:50,560 --> 03:17:54,479
constrained

03:17:52,080 --> 03:17:55,760
to have more sustained contributions for

03:17:54,479 --> 03:17:58,479
that to happen

03:17:55,760 --> 03:17:59,040
i think nurturing community mobilizers

03:17:58,479 --> 03:18:02,399
working

03:17:59,040 --> 03:18:03,840
closely with them to understand how they

03:18:02,399 --> 03:18:05,920
could be a succession plan

03:18:03,840 --> 03:18:07,439
if you are a community leader growing a

03:18:05,920 --> 03:18:10,560
community of say

03:18:07,439 --> 03:18:11,680
python in uh in a geography city or

03:18:10,560 --> 03:18:14,080
three city

03:18:11,680 --> 03:18:15,120
you have to figure out how you can have

03:18:14,080 --> 03:18:18,080
a successor

03:18:15,120 --> 03:18:20,239
as well for you groom them uh so that

03:18:18,080 --> 03:18:23,279
you don't face burnouts you don't face

03:18:20,239 --> 03:18:23,920
issues related to technology overheads

03:18:23,279 --> 03:18:27,279
and

03:18:23,920 --> 03:18:30,560
community management etc so having a

03:18:27,279 --> 03:18:33,200
nurtured community mobilizers who are

03:18:30,560 --> 03:18:35,439
there for you to grow the community in

03:18:33,200 --> 03:18:37,680
different direction is super helpful

03:18:35,439 --> 03:18:39,120
and lastly having a global connect

03:18:37,680 --> 03:18:41,439
invest more on research

03:18:39,120 --> 03:18:43,840
invest more on collaborations working

03:18:41,439 --> 03:18:46,640
with the communities out there

03:18:43,840 --> 03:18:47,840
coming to events like satellite would be

03:18:46,640 --> 03:18:50,239
super helpful

03:18:47,840 --> 03:18:52,000
to connect and understand what is going

03:18:50,239 --> 03:18:52,880
on on free and open source software

03:18:52,000 --> 03:18:56,000
ecosystem

03:18:52,880 --> 03:18:57,439
globally so uh investing on research and

03:18:56,000 --> 03:19:00,479
collaboration would be

03:18:57,439 --> 03:19:02,160
super helpful uh when it comes to force

03:19:00,479 --> 03:19:04,239
and education especially

03:19:02,160 --> 03:19:05,439
academic institutions there is still

03:19:04,239 --> 03:19:08,160
quite dependence on

03:19:05,439 --> 03:19:08,640
proprietary software dominance we have

03:19:08,160 --> 03:19:11,200
seen

03:19:08,640 --> 03:19:12,720
there is still less proliferation of

03:19:11,200 --> 03:19:15,279
free and open source software in the

03:19:12,720 --> 03:19:18,160
early education of computers

03:19:15,279 --> 03:19:19,439
so what we are looking for is more false

03:19:18,160 --> 03:19:21,279
led curriculum

03:19:19,439 --> 03:19:23,200
and we have started to see some early

03:19:21,279 --> 03:19:26,640
experiments from this front

03:19:23,200 --> 03:19:30,560
where i t uh i.t education

03:19:26,640 --> 03:19:33,040
in kerala has improved or also

03:19:30,560 --> 03:19:34,319
id for change in karnataka is working to

03:19:33,040 --> 03:19:37,040
create curriculum

03:19:34,319 --> 03:19:38,319
with the public schools in karnataka to

03:19:37,040 --> 03:19:40,640
see

03:19:38,319 --> 03:19:41,760
how uh free and open source software

03:19:40,640 --> 03:19:44,080
could be promoted

03:19:41,760 --> 03:19:44,880
in the early stages of learning

03:19:44,080 --> 03:19:48,319
computers

03:19:44,880 --> 03:19:50,080
itself uh there's still limited force

03:19:48,319 --> 03:19:51,920
education so where need

03:19:50,080 --> 03:19:53,359
there's a need for more forced digital

03:19:51,920 --> 03:19:55,439
literacy programs

03:19:53,359 --> 03:19:57,600
there's need for tailoring some of these

03:19:55,439 --> 03:19:58,800
programs for local contacts local

03:19:57,600 --> 03:20:01,120
languages

03:19:58,800 --> 03:20:02,880
and fossee at iit bombay is doing a

03:20:01,120 --> 03:20:06,080
wonderful job of doing the same

03:20:02,880 --> 03:20:07,840
by creating uh video repositories in

03:20:06,080 --> 03:20:10,960
multiple languages

03:20:07,840 --> 03:20:15,120
translating them for different purposes

03:20:10,960 --> 03:20:18,319
uh for enabling first-time non-english

03:20:15,120 --> 03:20:20,000
users of computers to start programming

03:20:18,319 --> 03:20:22,080
in some of the popular free and open

03:20:20,000 --> 03:20:23,520
source software so please go and check

03:20:22,080 --> 03:20:25,680
it out

03:20:23,520 --> 03:20:27,200
we still face the issue of poor

03:20:25,680 --> 03:20:28,239
contribution and retention in the

03:20:27,200 --> 03:20:30,080
community

03:20:28,239 --> 03:20:31,359
and that is something which we can fix

03:20:30,080 --> 03:20:34,720
by incentivizing

03:20:31,359 --> 03:20:37,120
research and innovation uh supporting

03:20:34,720 --> 03:20:38,880
young academic scholars to do more free

03:20:37,120 --> 03:20:40,560
and open source software work with the

03:20:38,880 --> 03:20:43,439
community

03:20:40,560 --> 03:20:44,160
enabling them to figure out how they can

03:20:43,439 --> 03:20:47,279
um

03:20:44,160 --> 03:20:48,479
work in terms of incentivizing new

03:20:47,279 --> 03:20:51,760
programs for

03:20:48,479 --> 03:20:54,160
new researchers to plan different uptake

03:20:51,760 --> 03:20:56,800
of existing fee and open source software

03:20:54,160 --> 03:20:58,399
in researching on the needs of creating

03:20:56,800 --> 03:21:00,160
new free and open source software which

03:20:58,399 --> 03:21:02,800
would beneficial more

03:21:00,160 --> 03:21:05,359
groups in the country lastly limited

03:21:02,800 --> 03:21:06,399
collaboration academia also has facing

03:21:05,359 --> 03:21:08,479
the same issue

03:21:06,399 --> 03:21:09,680
so creating more open education

03:21:08,479 --> 03:21:12,000
infrastructure

03:21:09,680 --> 03:21:13,760
the way the kite program in kerala is

03:21:12,000 --> 03:21:15,920
doing where they have

03:21:13,760 --> 03:21:17,359
moved a lot of schools to free and open

03:21:15,920 --> 03:21:18,800
source software

03:21:17,359 --> 03:21:21,279
they are now trying to work with

03:21:18,800 --> 03:21:22,960
colleges also to move in that direction

03:21:21,279 --> 03:21:25,120
creating a common pool of

03:21:22,960 --> 03:21:26,720
shared resources and especially in the

03:21:25,120 --> 03:21:29,760
time of pandemic where

03:21:26,720 --> 03:21:31,920
education is is

03:21:29,760 --> 03:21:33,279
least approachable for people who have

03:21:31,920 --> 03:21:36,319
limited connectivity

03:21:33,279 --> 03:21:36,720
a limited bandwidth um there is a need

03:21:36,319 --> 03:21:38,239
for

03:21:36,720 --> 03:21:40,560
more free and open source software which

03:21:38,239 --> 03:21:42,720
can help us take knowledge which is

03:21:40,560 --> 03:21:44,399
stuck with certain group of people to

03:21:42,720 --> 03:21:45,840
more community members

03:21:44,399 --> 03:21:47,840
and the best thing about free and open

03:21:45,840 --> 03:21:50,160
source software in education is

03:21:47,840 --> 03:21:51,279
students can learn it can make it can

03:21:50,160 --> 03:21:53,359
break the software

03:21:51,279 --> 03:21:55,040
and we learn the best when we break it

03:21:53,359 --> 03:21:56,720
and and fix it

03:21:55,040 --> 03:21:58,880
so that's the kind of opportunity we

03:21:56,720 --> 03:22:00,239
have with the more free and open source

03:21:58,880 --> 03:22:03,840
software based

03:22:00,239 --> 03:22:06,960
uh education infrastructure

03:22:03,840 --> 03:22:09,600
the third one is foss and businesses uh

03:22:06,960 --> 03:22:11,760
even with businesses there is a limited

03:22:09,600 --> 03:22:14,160
force understanding at this point

03:22:11,760 --> 03:22:16,239
um there is a need for conducting more

03:22:14,160 --> 03:22:19,520
force workshops for early

03:22:16,239 --> 03:22:21,279
group of uh people they the

03:22:19,520 --> 03:22:24,319
early businesses who are just starting

03:22:21,279 --> 03:22:26,399
off it's super beneficial for them to

03:22:24,319 --> 03:22:27,920
see what kind of softwares are out there

03:22:26,399 --> 03:22:30,640
which they can reuse

03:22:27,920 --> 03:22:32,160
get some expert help on licensing get

03:22:30,640 --> 03:22:34,560
some expert help on

03:22:32,160 --> 03:22:35,520
what kind of business models could be

03:22:34,560 --> 03:22:38,000
there for

03:22:35,520 --> 03:22:38,880
them to build on free and open source

03:22:38,000 --> 03:22:41,279
software

03:22:38,880 --> 03:22:42,399
also get some legal and policy support

03:22:41,279 --> 03:22:45,600
as they grow

03:22:42,399 --> 03:22:46,319
because that helps them figure out how

03:22:45,600 --> 03:22:49,120
they can

03:22:46,319 --> 03:22:49,920
do force on a sustainable basis uh and

03:22:49,120 --> 03:22:53,279
scale with

03:22:49,920 --> 03:22:54,640
with it um sustained contributions even

03:22:53,279 --> 03:22:57,760
in small and big

03:22:54,640 --> 03:22:58,399
businesses is an issue uh fos we need

03:22:57,760 --> 03:23:00,880
more force

03:22:58,399 --> 03:23:02,319
projects and sponsorship for different

03:23:00,880 --> 03:23:04,239
force events which are

03:23:02,319 --> 03:23:05,680
business critical mission critical for

03:23:04,239 --> 03:23:08,160
you to grow

03:23:05,680 --> 03:23:09,760
so sponsoring events sponsoring

03:23:08,160 --> 03:23:12,800
community sprints sponsoring

03:23:09,760 --> 03:23:14,640
new uh talent uptake programs

03:23:12,800 --> 03:23:16,800
uh is something which we can definitely

03:23:14,640 --> 03:23:18,640
target for businesses because

03:23:16,800 --> 03:23:20,800
that would not just help the community

03:23:18,640 --> 03:23:22,560
but also help businesses create more

03:23:20,800 --> 03:23:23,680
talent which can work on some of this

03:23:22,560 --> 03:23:26,640
frost project

03:23:23,680 --> 03:23:28,720
and lastly having more community connect

03:23:26,640 --> 03:23:30,640
find opportunities to work with academia

03:23:28,720 --> 03:23:32,880
find opportunities to work with

03:23:30,640 --> 03:23:34,319
different communities governments

03:23:32,880 --> 03:23:36,399
businesses can do a lot

03:23:34,319 --> 03:23:37,600
by creating different collaboration

03:23:36,399 --> 03:23:39,760
programs and

03:23:37,600 --> 03:23:40,640
corporate social responsibility programs

03:23:39,760 --> 03:23:44,720
to collaborate

03:23:40,640 --> 03:23:47,520
more on foss lastly governments

03:23:44,720 --> 03:23:49,200
so there is very limited first capacity

03:23:47,520 --> 03:23:50,160
with most of the government staff at the

03:23:49,200 --> 03:23:52,479
moment

03:23:50,160 --> 03:23:54,000
what we can do is probably plug some of

03:23:52,479 --> 03:23:56,160
the experts from the developer

03:23:54,000 --> 03:23:58,319
communities to work with

03:23:56,160 --> 03:23:59,760
uh different government stakeholders in

03:23:58,319 --> 03:24:03,359
a fellowship model

03:23:59,760 --> 03:24:04,560
beat local uh or uh national or state

03:24:03,359 --> 03:24:06,800
level governments

03:24:04,560 --> 03:24:08,399
uh to see how free and open source

03:24:06,800 --> 03:24:09,760
software could be beneficial for more

03:24:08,399 --> 03:24:11,600
number of people

03:24:09,760 --> 03:24:13,600
uh this would in turn reduce the

03:24:11,600 --> 03:24:16,080
dependence on commercial software

03:24:13,600 --> 03:24:18,319
and we would see more public money being

03:24:16,080 --> 03:24:20,640
used to create public software

03:24:18,319 --> 03:24:21,760
um and more procurements i.t

03:24:20,640 --> 03:24:24,640
procurements would have

03:24:21,760 --> 03:24:26,160
false first mandate in them also

03:24:24,640 --> 03:24:30,319
currently there are very few

03:24:26,160 --> 03:24:32,640
first repositories from current uh

03:24:30,319 --> 03:24:34,080
different set of governments so

03:24:32,640 --> 03:24:36,479
encouraging them to publish

03:24:34,080 --> 03:24:37,279
more and working with them to fix some

03:24:36,479 --> 03:24:39,200
of the bugs

03:24:37,279 --> 03:24:40,800
they face in the software would help us

03:24:39,200 --> 03:24:43,200
create robots

03:24:40,800 --> 03:24:45,200
public digital services and this would

03:24:43,200 --> 03:24:46,720
in turn increase the reach of free and

03:24:45,200 --> 03:24:49,359
open source software

03:24:46,720 --> 03:24:50,000
helping us create more digital public

03:24:49,359 --> 03:24:52,080
goods

03:24:50,000 --> 03:24:54,479
which are running on free and open

03:24:52,080 --> 03:24:56,399
source software for which the code is

03:24:54,479 --> 03:24:58,479
open for people to collaborate

03:24:56,399 --> 03:25:01,840
contribute and work with

03:24:58,479 --> 03:25:04,880
and have a bug free growth of

03:25:01,840 --> 03:25:04,880
digital economy

03:25:04,960 --> 03:25:09,520
and we are already seeing this happening

03:25:07,359 --> 03:25:11,760
all these stakeholders

03:25:09,520 --> 03:25:12,720
though they mean they seem quite sparse

03:25:11,760 --> 03:25:14,479
but they are

03:25:12,720 --> 03:25:16,160
coming together especially in the time

03:25:14,479 --> 03:25:18,479
of crisis especially in

03:25:16,160 --> 03:25:20,800
in this pandemic where we have to rely

03:25:18,479 --> 03:25:22,720
more on digital collaboration

03:25:20,800 --> 03:25:24,560
and come up with fast solution for some

03:25:22,720 --> 03:25:28,720
of the crucial problems

03:25:24,560 --> 03:25:31,200
we are seeing uh we saw kobet 19 india a

03:25:28,720 --> 03:25:32,399
fantastic initiative where different

03:25:31,200 --> 03:25:34,960
volunteers came

03:25:32,399 --> 03:25:35,520
together overnight to contribute and

03:25:34,960 --> 03:25:38,239
work

03:25:35,520 --> 03:25:39,120
and create a robust platform for

03:25:38,239 --> 03:25:41,279
tracking

03:25:39,120 --> 03:25:43,520
dc spread in the country and now the

03:25:41,279 --> 03:25:46,640
vaccination drives

03:25:43,520 --> 03:25:48,000
they are collaborating data they're

03:25:46,640 --> 03:25:50,160
crowdsourcing data from different

03:25:48,000 --> 03:25:53,520
sources they're collaborating to create

03:25:50,160 --> 03:25:55,520
robust digital maps and scalable mobile

03:25:53,520 --> 03:25:57,600
applications and apis which could be

03:25:55,520 --> 03:26:00,080
used for different purposes of research

03:25:57,600 --> 03:26:01,200
and analysis on this data even economic

03:26:00,080 --> 03:26:03,760
survey this year

03:26:01,200 --> 03:26:04,880
quoted them as one of the reliable

03:26:03,760 --> 03:26:07,840
source of

03:26:04,880 --> 03:26:08,960
knowledge out there on covet 19 spread

03:26:07,840 --> 03:26:12,560
we also saw

03:26:08,960 --> 03:26:16,239
iisc bangalore who recently published

03:26:12,560 --> 03:26:16,880
a city stimulator on how pandemic spread

03:26:16,239 --> 03:26:19,680
may happen

03:26:16,880 --> 03:26:20,560
in cities like bangalore see a vod voice

03:26:19,680 --> 03:26:22,800
distribution

03:26:20,560 --> 03:26:24,319
based on different parameters they open

03:26:22,800 --> 03:26:26,880
sort this code so that

03:26:24,319 --> 03:26:27,359
district administrators can use this to

03:26:26,880 --> 03:26:30,479
plan

03:26:27,359 --> 03:26:33,680
their lockdown initiatives

03:26:30,479 --> 03:26:35,920
vaccination drives etc we also saw

03:26:33,680 --> 03:26:38,239
businesses like ibm opening up their

03:26:35,920 --> 03:26:41,359
genomics uh research platform

03:26:38,239 --> 03:26:44,479
for faster uh genomics research

03:26:41,359 --> 03:26:45,520
on some of the covet vaccines which are

03:26:44,479 --> 03:26:47,840
out there

03:26:45,520 --> 03:26:49,359
helping more academicians and

03:26:47,840 --> 03:26:51,760
researchers to

03:26:49,359 --> 03:26:53,279
work faster with the solutions they have

03:26:51,760 --> 03:26:54,239
and lastly we are seeing government

03:26:53,279 --> 03:26:56,560
initiatives

03:26:54,239 --> 03:26:58,080
like kerala government working very

03:26:56,560 --> 03:27:00,160
closely with coronal

03:26:58,080 --> 03:27:02,000
literacy network which is a volunteer

03:27:00,160 --> 03:27:05,120
driven community network

03:27:02,000 --> 03:27:06,160
of open source uh literacy knowledge on

03:27:05,120 --> 03:27:09,600
corona

03:27:06,160 --> 03:27:10,319
and a whole suit of software which is

03:27:09,600 --> 03:27:13,359
used as

03:27:10,319 --> 03:27:16,160
a currently as a base for uh

03:27:13,359 --> 03:27:16,960
control center of kerala kovat 19

03:27:16,160 --> 03:27:19,120
mission

03:27:16,960 --> 03:27:21,359
so all these collaborations are already

03:27:19,120 --> 03:27:24,319
happening we just need to scale them

03:27:21,359 --> 03:27:25,600
and come up with a possible future where

03:27:24,319 --> 03:27:28,080
more stakeholders

03:27:25,600 --> 03:27:30,640
work together thrive together grow

03:27:28,080 --> 03:27:32,640
together and clean open source software

03:27:30,640 --> 03:27:34,560
and this is how it may look we are

03:27:32,640 --> 03:27:35,600
calling this as a national force

03:27:34,560 --> 03:27:38,720
alliance

03:27:35,600 --> 03:27:39,600
powering growth of india uh if you are a

03:27:38,720 --> 03:27:42,560
developer

03:27:39,600 --> 03:27:44,319
you're hoping to build more capacity of

03:27:42,560 --> 03:27:47,760
younger contributors

03:27:44,319 --> 03:27:49,279
uh activate more leaders uh be

03:27:47,760 --> 03:27:51,200
participate in leadership program

03:27:49,279 --> 03:27:53,040
yourselves or help others

03:27:51,200 --> 03:27:55,680
groom their leadership skills so that

03:27:53,040 --> 03:27:58,640
there is a thriving community

03:27:55,680 --> 03:27:59,680
and bring more diversity we can't

03:27:58,640 --> 03:28:02,560
emphasize

03:27:59,680 --> 03:28:04,080
enough on that if you are an academician

03:28:02,560 --> 03:28:06,399
who is looking to contribute on the

03:28:04,080 --> 03:28:08,399
faucet ecosystem you can improve

03:28:06,399 --> 03:28:09,439
on creating better force literacy

03:28:08,399 --> 03:28:11,439
programs

03:28:09,439 --> 03:28:12,640
help us foster more research on free and

03:28:11,439 --> 03:28:15,520
open source software

03:28:12,640 --> 03:28:17,600
build more talent uh to work on free and

03:28:15,520 --> 03:28:19,600
open source software groom them

03:28:17,600 --> 03:28:21,120
if you're businesses you can incubate

03:28:19,600 --> 03:28:24,319
more fast projects

03:28:21,120 --> 03:28:26,880
you can create a marketplace of force

03:28:24,319 --> 03:28:28,800
alternatives which are out there you can

03:28:26,880 --> 03:28:30,239
advertise the kind of fast initiatives

03:28:28,800 --> 03:28:32,000
you have been doing so that more people

03:28:30,239 --> 03:28:33,840
can participate with you

03:28:32,000 --> 03:28:35,920
and you can support the existing talent

03:28:33,840 --> 03:28:38,000
pool who is quite interested to work on

03:28:35,920 --> 03:28:40,080
free and open source software

03:28:38,000 --> 03:28:41,439
if you are a government initiative you

03:28:40,080 --> 03:28:43,680
can work to create

03:28:41,439 --> 03:28:45,680
more false lag projects where citizens

03:28:43,680 --> 03:28:46,000
can collaborate with you can work with

03:28:45,680 --> 03:28:48,239
you

03:28:46,000 --> 03:28:50,479
and ensure that there is better digital

03:28:48,239 --> 03:28:52,560
service delivery

03:28:50,479 --> 03:28:54,080
you can think of creating more for

03:28:52,560 --> 03:28:55,840
stacks so that

03:28:54,080 --> 03:28:58,239
the software which you make is

03:28:55,840 --> 03:29:00,880
replicable in other geographies

03:28:58,239 --> 03:29:02,720
it's happening already with more uh

03:29:00,880 --> 03:29:04,720
governments opening up their source code

03:29:02,720 --> 03:29:06,399
so it's easy for them for other

03:29:04,720 --> 03:29:09,120
governments to replicate it

03:29:06,399 --> 03:29:10,720
customize it based on different needs

03:29:09,120 --> 03:29:13,520
and lastly localize the

03:29:10,720 --> 03:29:14,319
deck localize based on language local

03:29:13,520 --> 03:29:17,520
contacts

03:29:14,319 --> 03:29:18,640
etc so a lot could be done in shaping

03:29:17,520 --> 03:29:20,800
this national

03:29:18,640 --> 03:29:21,840
foss alliance when all these

03:29:20,800 --> 03:29:24,080
stakeholders

03:29:21,840 --> 03:29:25,439
come together work together with the

03:29:24,080 --> 03:29:28,479
shared vision of shaping

03:29:25,439 --> 03:29:30,479
india's digital economy

03:29:28,479 --> 03:29:31,840
and lastly this is the team who has

03:29:30,479 --> 03:29:34,000
worked on this report

03:29:31,840 --> 03:29:35,600
i am very grateful to all of them for

03:29:34,000 --> 03:29:38,080
sharing their expertise sharing

03:29:35,600 --> 03:29:39,439
insights and doing continuous research

03:29:38,080 --> 03:29:42,479
on this topic

03:29:39,439 --> 03:29:46,160

download the report at state of force

03:29:48,640 --> 03:29:52,319
dot in

03:29:49,520 --> 03:29:54,319
explore the detailed first timeline did

03:29:52,319 --> 03:29:56,720
read more about different case studies

03:29:54,319 --> 03:29:58,479
these stakeholders and how you can play

03:29:56,720 --> 03:29:59,760
a major role in shaping the fos

03:29:58,479 --> 03:30:02,800
ecosystem

03:29:59,760 --> 03:30:05,359

free to go

03:30:09,120 --> 03:30:12,479
thanks a lot guerra you know that was a

03:30:10,960 --> 03:30:16,000
that was a really interesting

03:30:12,479 --> 03:30:16,800
uh overview about uh false and open

03:30:16,000 --> 03:30:19,920
source

03:30:16,800 --> 03:30:21,920
out here in india so uh

03:30:19,920 --> 03:30:23,520
there are uh you know a couple of

03:30:21,920 --> 03:30:24,000
questions that have come in but before

03:30:23,520 --> 03:30:26,000
that

03:30:24,000 --> 03:30:27,680
a reminder to all of you that guru is

03:30:26,000 --> 03:30:29,680
gonna be around on

03:30:27,680 --> 03:30:30,960
uh get up discussion so if you have any

03:30:29,680 --> 03:30:33,359
questions uh

03:30:30,960 --> 03:30:34,720
head over to github satellite.com

03:30:33,359 --> 03:30:37,040
discussions where

03:30:34,720 --> 03:30:39,120
gara will be taking up any questions for

03:30:37,040 --> 03:30:42,239
the next 30 minutes

03:30:39,120 --> 03:30:46,479
um so one of the questions uh that came

03:30:42,239 --> 03:30:48,399
in gara is um how do you see like

03:30:46,479 --> 03:30:50,080
different stakeholders within the

03:30:48,399 --> 03:30:52,720
ecosystem come together

03:30:50,080 --> 03:30:54,880
to shape the future of open source in

03:30:52,720 --> 03:30:58,479
india

03:30:54,880 --> 03:31:01,920
right i think what we need is a national

03:30:58,479 --> 03:31:03,359
for strategy where we clearly articulate

03:31:01,920 --> 03:31:04,960
what would be the role of different

03:31:03,359 --> 03:31:06,880
stakeholders be

03:31:04,960 --> 03:31:08,880
so just in my previous slides i

03:31:06,880 --> 03:31:09,520
mentioned that if you're a community

03:31:08,880 --> 03:31:12,800
member

03:31:09,520 --> 03:31:14,239
you can work strategy to activate more

03:31:12,800 --> 03:31:17,040
forced leadership

03:31:14,239 --> 03:31:18,880
similarly if different stakeholders can

03:31:17,040 --> 03:31:20,640
i can have a defined set of roles and

03:31:18,880 --> 03:31:22,080
responsibilities we can all work

03:31:20,640 --> 03:31:26,880
together to create

03:31:22,080 --> 03:31:29,279
a thriving force ecosystem

03:31:26,880 --> 03:31:30,880
great i got a question for you then as

03:31:29,279 --> 03:31:32,479
well um how can you strengthen

03:31:30,880 --> 03:31:35,439
the community leadership and foster

03:31:32,479 --> 03:31:37,680
ecosystem in india

03:31:35,439 --> 03:31:38,640
i think the major issue here at this

03:31:37,680 --> 03:31:41,920
point is

03:31:38,640 --> 03:31:43,760
very less access to force lead force

03:31:41,920 --> 03:31:44,560
leadership first mentoring in academic

03:31:43,760 --> 03:31:46,239
institutions

03:31:44,560 --> 03:31:47,920
so partnering with more academic

03:31:46,239 --> 03:31:51,840
institutions to have

03:31:47,920 --> 03:31:54,960
force value education for

03:31:51,840 --> 03:31:56,800
project education education about how

03:31:54,960 --> 03:31:58,239
you can participate in existing fast

03:31:56,800 --> 03:32:01,439
initiatives some

03:31:58,239 --> 03:32:03,359
basic leadership and mentorship programs

03:32:01,439 --> 03:32:04,479
outreachy is a wonderful example which

03:32:03,359 --> 03:32:06,640
is trying to do that

03:32:04,479 --> 03:32:08,720
with the final year students in

03:32:06,640 --> 03:32:12,000
different colleges even in india

03:32:08,720 --> 03:32:14,479
on how they can work to

03:32:12,000 --> 03:32:16,319
contribute in existing fast projects

03:32:14,479 --> 03:32:17,840
work very closely with the outreachy

03:32:16,319 --> 03:32:20,080
leader

03:32:17,840 --> 03:32:21,680
groom under them and once you are

03:32:20,080 --> 03:32:23,040
confident you can also become an

03:32:21,680 --> 03:32:26,479
outreachy mentor

03:32:23,040 --> 03:32:30,000
and help other communities to grow with

03:32:26,479 --> 03:32:32,640
you so and this would also improve our

03:32:30,000 --> 03:32:34,399
diversity inclusivity and equity in pos

03:32:32,640 --> 03:32:34,800
community which has remained a major

03:32:34,399 --> 03:32:37,840
issue

03:32:34,800 --> 03:32:37,840
especially in india

03:32:39,040 --> 03:32:43,279
great uh thanks a lot carol for sharing

03:32:42,479 --> 03:32:47,040
some of those

03:32:43,279 --> 03:32:50,319
you know insights about uh false and

03:32:47,040 --> 03:32:52,239
open source out here in india so uh

03:32:50,319 --> 03:32:54,770

um and i can't believe it all of the

03:33:07,359 --> 03:33:11,680
content has been

03:33:08,880 --> 03:33:12,560
absolutely amazing that's all i can say

03:33:11,680 --> 03:33:14,640
this emoji

03:33:12,560 --> 03:33:15,760
really sums it up but you know what our

03:33:14,640 --> 03:33:17,200
speaker is the one

03:33:15,760 --> 03:33:19,760
our next speaker is a one and only

03:33:17,200 --> 03:33:21,760
martin woodward who is the director of

03:33:19,760 --> 03:33:22,479
developer relations at github and you

03:33:21,760 --> 03:33:24,720
probably

03:33:22,479 --> 03:33:26,319
recognize his name or you familiar with

03:33:24,720 --> 03:33:27,439
him because he hosted the enterprise

channel for universe

03:33:27,439 --> 03:33:32,399
2020 and i guess he's our role model for

03:33:30,080 --> 03:33:35,520
how to host professionally right so
