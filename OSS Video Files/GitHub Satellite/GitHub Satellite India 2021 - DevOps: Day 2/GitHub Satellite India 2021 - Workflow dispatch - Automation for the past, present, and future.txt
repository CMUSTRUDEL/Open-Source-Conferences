Publication date: 2021-03-28
Playlist: GitHub Satellite India 2021 - DevOps: Day 2
Description: 
	Presented by Vishnu Bharathi, Software Engineer @ Hasura

This is a CI/CD story from Hasura about how we discovered a faster and incremental approach to developing our internal tooling. We will discuss how GitHub Actions' workflow dispatch is helping our team at each phase of our automation journeyâ€”from thinking to building, backfilling to automating.

We will also share insights and best practices that we learned along the way for writing and testing workflows. Overall, you'll get to visualize a practical usecase for workflow dispatch, and how it keeps our OSS project and our internal monorepo intact.
