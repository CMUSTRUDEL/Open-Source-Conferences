Title: GitHub Satellite India 2021 - Accelerate inner dev loop while developing with Skaffold
Publication date: 2021-03-28
Playlist: GitHub Satellite India 2021 - DevOps: Day 2
Description: 
	Presented by Ashish Choudhary, Senior Developer @ Citi

Containers and Kubernetes have changed the way we package and deploy modern-day cloud-native applications. We can achieve smart scheduling and auto-scale our applications based upon our business needs with little effort, and it has improved operational concerns for the support teams. However, there is not much improvement in the developer experience. Most developers still spend time configuring their local environment instead of focusing on the actual task at hand: the code.

In this talk, we will discuss various options, like Skaffold, that can ease the pain of developing an application with Kubernetes. We'll cover the steps that a developer has to typically follow to build cloud-native applications in the development's inner loop, and explain how to use Skaffold to create a production-ready CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for cloud-native applications.
