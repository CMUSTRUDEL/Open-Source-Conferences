and so to close us out to thank everyone

00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:09,300

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:12,059
ever online only event that github has

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,960
ever done to close out github satellite

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:18,539
virtual 2020 please welcome amazing CEO

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:29,429
of github Ericka brusher herself

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:31,769
welcome to the stage thank you so much

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:35,520
Michelle and Jared oh my gosh there's

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:38,399
been so much fantastic energy today it

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,649
just whizzed past and you know I thought

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,629
I was getting the easiest gig of the day

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,120
just talking about all the cool stuff

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:48,030
that that we saw and everything that we

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,789
learned and I'll tell you what everyone

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:54,600
set such a high bar now I feel like the

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:56,520
pressure is really on I do have to say

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,800
though I am really bummed that they did

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,079
not send me a red phone like not got

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,550
very disappointed about that I mean I

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,670
have to get somebody to hook me up with

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:10,260
one of those but I can't believe it's

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:12,510
been 12 hours since that moment as I

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,659
said an absolutely action-packed day

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,720
that went by incredibly quickly for me

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:22,290
we started out with some big

00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:24,750
announcements discussions code spaces

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,450
advanced security code scanning and

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,840
secret scanning actions and packages on

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:33,869
server insights and private instances we

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,750
are so excited to bring all of this to

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:39,270
our community and you know not as Ngata

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,310
said and as I've said before we have an

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,549
incredible team here at github but

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,770
there's no way that their creativity can

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:50,100
match that of the amazing global

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,110
developer community so we can't wait to

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,750
see what you all do with these new

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,299
features and products and as we say

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,979
github we ship to learn so we look

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,869
forward to getting your feedback on

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:02,369
everything that we're releasing and

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,110
iterating to make sure that we're

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:08,520
continuing to provide the best possible

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:11,400
home for all developers and speaking of

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,110
the developer community we now have over

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,240
50 milli

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,150
developers and three million

00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,640
organizations on github that means that

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,060
ten million developers have joined

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,110
github since last October our

00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,810
interconnected community is getting

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,270
bigger and it's better than ever and the

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,730
best thing about that is that we all get

00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:35,670
to benefit from the growth as existing

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,680
projects gain more contributors and new

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,540
ones are launched and we saw some really

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,310
exciting statistics that were shared

00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,440
earlier today and the update to the

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,180
state of the october's report on what's

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,010
happening in light of kovat and all the

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,830
folks coming together to work on that

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,900
it's just so exciting to think about all

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,790
the progress that these 50 million

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,850
developers and Counting will make over

00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:00,360
the course of the next year but going

00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:02,400
back to today we heard from over 50

00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,590
speakers and performers in nine

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,590
countries around the world and they

00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:10,320
represent so many cool technologies and

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,870
projects we heard about everything from

00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:16,170
best practices on remote work to seeing

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:18,900
a human versus AI rat battle that was

00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:21,840
super cool to checking out live demos

00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,450
all the demos were live which is awesome

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,489
and everyone did a fantastic job of all

00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,890
of our new products and features we

00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:31,320
heard from a student developer at sa P

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:35,780
about how they do credential mitigation

00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:38,880
on over 200,000 repositories and the

00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,830
amazing live coding performances were

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,780
super cool I don't know how they do that

00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:45,180
I think I'd feel way too much pressure

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,519
but there's clearly so much talent out

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:51,299
there and that's really just scratching

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:55,350
the surface in terms of the stats for

00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:59,820
today more than 40,000 people joined in

00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:02,790
my mind is still blown by that from 178

00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:06,390
countries and it's so cool to see how

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:08,160
turning satellite into a remote event

00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,140
into a digital event let everybody

00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,079
around the world join us and celebrate

00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:16,620
and learn together in light of that we

00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:18,810
had over 1700 comments actually 1800

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,010
they updated that stat right before I

00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,020
came on

00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,840
in our new discussions and it was so

00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:27,480
cool to see folks coming together and

00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,850
discussing what was being launched and

00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,310
asking questions of the speakers I hope

00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:35,970
you'll all try discussions now on your

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:38,550
projects we also had some pets join and

00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:40,880
we spotted a few kiddos too clearly a

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,260
future developers start young I

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,570
personally loved seeing the ways that

00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,490
people were tuning into satellite from

00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,800
all over the world if you haven't

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:52,200
already check out the github satellite

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,360
hashtag on Twitter because there were a

00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,370
ton of great photos and discussions

00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,630
online and it was a lot of fun follow

00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:02,160
throughout the day we had so many cool

00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:04,650
announcements today I don't think I

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,930
could ever choose just one but I do have

00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,190
some favorites and I'd like to just take

00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,640
a minute lect

00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:13,950
ah yeah it was almost late to his

00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,450
keynote and not really not sure people

00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,280
really bought that he was late but it

00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:20,100
was still cool and just for the record

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,180
we are not sponsored by T Rios but NAT

00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:26,910
is a fan I loved seeing our canvas

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,070
experts in India they held a watch party

00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,560
and tweeted the screenshot which I

00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,150
thought was super cool they said they

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,310
were gonna tune in again this morning

00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,080
their time to watch the closing so hope

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,840
you're all there and thanks for all you

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,980
do to spread github in college campuses

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,390
in India and around the world I

00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:48,620
personally love seeing Allyson

00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:51,600
Macmillan's incredible code spaces demo

00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:54,150
and I loved that she had this cool app

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,220
for pre-school call tracking I want to

00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,200
give a huge shout out to her and all of

00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,600
the working parents who are doing

00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:04,200
important work not just during that time

00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,120
but all of the time and did you catch

00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:10,050
the the rat battle I mentioned this

00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:14,010
before but it was absolutely awesome I

00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:16,230
loved seeing them go head-to-head and of

00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:20,100
course humans still won but it was

00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:22,200
fantastic we also had an incredible open

00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,600
source for good panel and learned about

00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,460
some incredible work that organizations

00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,550
are doing to bring people together to

00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:33,720
work against Co vyd and I found that

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:34,350
incredibly inspiring our team was super

00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,800
excited

00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:39,960
to ship discussions the community and I

00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,990
know it was really exciting for us to

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:46,560
see all of the incredible engagement we

00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:49,770
also have an unofficial MVP award to

github user at honset zero zero and I'm

00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:54,660
super sorry if I'm butchering your name

00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:57,450
but that person was with us almost the

00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:00,150
entire day it was incredibly helpful and

00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:02,610
I know one a ton of fans here at github

00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:04,890
we really appreciate you and everyone

00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:07,830
who jumped in to participate in the

00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:10,140
discussions and I don't know about you

00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:12,480
but I think the co-hosts were one of the

00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:15,150
things that made this day so special for

00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,250
me I cannot tell you how many times I've

00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:20,700
laughed out loud listening to them and

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:23,460
their energy was just inspiring and

00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,890
awesome and hats off to you all for

00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:31,320
doing pretty long stints and just being

00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:33,060
absolutely fantastic before I turn it

00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,760
over to our closing performance the

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,070
algorithmic positivity Symphony that's a

00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,320
bit of a mouthful I just want to remind

00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:42,510
you that all of the amazing content from

00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,940
today is recorded and is available to

00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:46,980
stream you can rewind the viewer right

00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,320
here or watch the individual sessions

00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:52,380
and performances from the schedule tab

00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:55,170
on github satellite comm I know there

00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,610
was a ton of great content we couldn't

00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:59,400
all take it in all at once especially

00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:01,290
with the two different streams going so

00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,740
I encourage you to go back and check it

00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:06,390

and I want to thank all of the people

00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:11,880

span of two months we went from an in

00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,950
real life event in Paris I'm supposed to

workshops and donate them to

00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:04,970
organizations working on Kovan relief

00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:07,430
we've been so inspired to see a global

00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:10,100
community of scientists government

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:12,470

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,510
concerned citizens coming together to

00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:17,390
collaborate on a variety of projects on

00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:19,370
github to address covin 19 and we wanted

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,380
to make sure that during satellite we

00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:24,080
extend the incredible privilege we have

00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,910
as being github to the vulnerable

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,240
communities that are impacted by this

00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:31,220
pandemic so the proceeds from the

00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,870
sponsorship and ticket revenue will be

00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,570
donated to these incredible

00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:37,460
organizations Bank Ã©lÃ©mentaire is the

00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,370
largest food bank network in France and

00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,530
serves two million people per year when

00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:44,390
we cancelled satellite in Paris it was

00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:46,700
critical to us to give back to the

00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:49,010
people of that same community who may be

00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:52,100
facing food insecurity and poverty as a

00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:53,810
result of the pandemic we're also giving

00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,140
to food bank for New York City which

00:09:53,810 --> 00:10:00,020
serves the 1.5 million New Yorkers who

00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:02,360
face food insecurity New York is the

00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,430
epicenter of the pandemic in the United

00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,530
States and many people have been forced

00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:09,500
to rely on the emergency food network

00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:11,240
for the first time and there's the

00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,580
global food banking Network which is

00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,770
providing critical funds shared learning

00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:18,020
and coordination to food banks around

00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:20,060
the world during this health crisis they

00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:22,280
work in more than 40 countries by

00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,710
sustaining Uniting and strengthening the

00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:27,260
work of food banks we're so grateful to

00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:29,000

00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:32,560

day thank you for being a github partner

00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:55,220
or customer and thank you for taking

00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:56,900
this journey for us in fact I'm so

00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,900
grateful that I'm going to do something

00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,380
incredible

00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:03,810
against my nature I am a bit of a neat

00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,370
freak and this is making me really

00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,590
nervous but I'm gonna give it a shot

00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:16,470
let's see what happens it could be

00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:18,030
really lame Bobby you missed all the

00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,560
streamers because they shot them in the

00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:22,200
wrong direction I think that's what I

00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,540
get for not trying it before but that

00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,790
was going to be more cleanup so there is

00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:31,800
now confetti all over my office in your

00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:34,230
honor thanks again everybody so be safe

00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,130
