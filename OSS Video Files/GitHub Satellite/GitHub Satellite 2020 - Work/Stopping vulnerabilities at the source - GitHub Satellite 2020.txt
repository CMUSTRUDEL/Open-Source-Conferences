	Presented by Grey Baker and Pavel Avgustinov, GitHub

Wouldn’t it be better if we could stop vulnerabilities from ever getting merged into our code base? By building security into our core workflows on GitHub and sharing the amazing knowledge of the combined global security community, we’re aiming to drastically reduce the number of vulnerabilities that get through your pull requests. In this session, we'll go deep into the CodeQL queries that help us find vulnerabilities across the source code, and how to create a query once you're aware of a new exploit, attack vector, or CVE. 

GitHub Satellite: A community connected by code

On May 6th, we threw a free virtual event featuring developers working together on the world’s software, announcements from the GitHub team, and inspiring performances by artists who code.
