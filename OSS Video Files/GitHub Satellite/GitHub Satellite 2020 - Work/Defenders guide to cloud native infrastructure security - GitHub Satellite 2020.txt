Title: Defenders guide to cloud native infrastructure security - GitHub Satellite 2020
Publication date: 2020-05-07
Playlist: GitHub Satellite 2020 - Work
Description: 
	Presented by Madhu Akula

"While DevOps teams have moved toward cloud, containers, Kubernetes, serverless, and cloud-native infrastructure, security teams are still catching up. In this talk, Madhu will discuss how to get started with setting up real-world cloud-native infrastructure using containers, serverless, and service mesh with automated deployments. What's more, each phase will contain built-in security checks with open source tools and cloud services.
 
Madhu will perform security checks at multiple layers—like Infrastructure Security, Supply Chain Security and Run Time Security—with real-world scenarios. At the end of the talk he'll verify the security of the cloud-native infrastructure by performing an automated security scan with the help of CIS Benchmarks. Following this talk, you'll feel comfortable applying these practical security skills to your daily operations, no matter your infrastructure. "
