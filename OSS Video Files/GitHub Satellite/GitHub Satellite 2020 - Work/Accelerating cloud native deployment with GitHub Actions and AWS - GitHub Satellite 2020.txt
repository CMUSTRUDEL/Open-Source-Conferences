	Presented by Christian Weber, Amazon AWS

For many developers, deploying to the cloud is a challenging journey: Selecting the 'right' tools, writing deployment scripts, and choosing a cloud provider can be a daunting task for developers looking to go Cloud Native for their application, and their organization. GitHub Actions and AWS can make developers' lives easier. But how do you get started? How can a developer deliver an idea and deploy it to the cloud without friction?
 
In this talk, Christian Weber will cover the best practices of using GitHub Actions and AWS, including writing agnostic deployment scripts with GitHub Actions to share across teams; commonly overlooked security risks when deploying via an AWS Pipeline; and how to use GitHub Actions and AWS for A/B and Blue/Green deployment techniques.
