Playlist: GitHub Satellite 2020 - Work
Description: 
	One year ago, Stripe created a remote engineering hub - a virtual office for remote engineers, coequal with its physical engineering offices. Aditya Mukerjee, the Remote Hub Site Lead, will share the lessons that Stripe has learned while building a globally distributed engineering team. Whether your team is working remotely temporarily due to COVID-19 or whether you are investing in remote work as a long-term strategy, the discoveries Stripe made along the way can set your team up for success in building high-quality software at scale and working effectively across geographical boundaries.
