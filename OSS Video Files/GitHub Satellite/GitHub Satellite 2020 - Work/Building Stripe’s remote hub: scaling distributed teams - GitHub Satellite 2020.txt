Title: Building Stripeâ€™s remote hub: scaling distributed teams - GitHub Satellite 2020
Publication date: 2020-05-07
Playlist: GitHub Satellite 2020 - Work
Description: 
	One year ago, Stripe created a remote engineering hub - a virtual office for remote engineers, coequal with its physical engineering offices. Aditya Mukerjee, the Remote Hub Site Lead, will share the lessons that Stripe has learned while building a globally distributed engineering team. Whether your team is working remotely temporarily due to COVID-19 or whether you are investing in remote work as a long-term strategy, the discoveries Stripe made along the way can set your team up for success in building high-quality software at scale and working effectively across geographical boundaries.

GitHub Satellite: A community connected by code

On May 6th, we threw a free virtual event featuring developers working together on the worldâ€™s software, announcements from the GitHub team, and inspiring performances by artists who code.

	00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,029
sounds like our next session it's gonna

00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:07,859
hit home for so many of our viewers yeah

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:09,059
yeah you're absolutely right emoji it's

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,010
officially about time for our next

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:13,080
session it's building strike remote hub

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,519
scaling distributed teams which is

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,470
really timely right now with everything

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,510
that's going on with covin that's gonna

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,460
be presented by observability engineer

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,550
and remote hub site lead at stripe

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,930
aditya mukajee the jaw has tons of

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,330
experience making remote collaboration

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,070
possible at the TI set up remote

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,689
engineering work policies across stripe

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,669
as it grew to nearly 200 remote

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,350
engineers so this session is really

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:36,660
really timely as we mentioned it's going

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,230
to be great I'm excited at the top gear

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:44,340
up

00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:44,340
[Music]

00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,269
hello everyone my name is Nadia and I

00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,640
work on the reliability team at stripe

00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:57,199
on observability I have also been

00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,049
working remotely at stripe for the past

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,120
five years now actually and for the last

00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:04,580
year I've also been the site lead for

00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,890
stripes remote ha it's funny stripe

00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,990
started this initiative of having a

00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,729
remote pub just over a year ago so I've

00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,100
been thinking for a while of how to talk

00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:15,590
about it publicly but that all got up

00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,970
ended about two months ago because it

00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,580
used to be a question of how to convince

00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:21,890
people to try remote work and now

00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,270
everyone like even New York City public

00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:26,000
school teachers are working remotely

00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,649
teaching 3rd graders from from their

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,479
homes I don't think anyone can really

00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:31,729
have predicted that just even six months

00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:33,649
ago so now that it feels like everyone

00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:35,299
is working remotely these are the two

00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:37,130
most important questions that I can help

00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:39,409
you answer today based on our year

00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:43,549
having first year of having remote hub

00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:45,860
that strength first why should remote

00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:47,780
work be our long-term strategy instead

00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,799
of just a short-term contingency and

00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,180
that's a question that a lot of

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,549
companies are asking at the executive

00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,250
level even if you're working remotely

00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:56,750
today due to covered 19 that doesn't

00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,789
mean that you're necessarily planning to

00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,219
continue that long term once it's safe

00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:02,810
to work in offices again so for those of

00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:04,909
you on the fence I'm here to tell you

00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:07,159
why you should open a remote hub as well

00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:09,109
why you should actively plan for remote

00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:12,230
work being a first-class strategy

00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:13,880
alongside your physical offices on the

00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,140
flip side if you're sold on permanent

00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,910
remote work but aren't sure how to

00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,850
convince your company of it this is also

00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:22,430
the talk for you the second question is

00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,690
is more of a general question once

00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,880
you've made the decision to work

00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,950
remotely and treat remote work as a

00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,500
pillar of our engineering strategy how

00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:32,209
do we do it right so today I'm here to

00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,459
share with you the strategies that we've

00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:37,310
used at stripe to grow our remote hub

00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:40,450
both in its size and also in the impact

00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,450
that remote teams have had

00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,820
we already had some remote engineers

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,010
before that you know I was one of them

00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,720
but remote engineering was something

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,520
that it strike we happened to support

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,490
not a core pillar of our engineering

00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:56,910
strategy that is until January of 2019

00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:59,580
when we launched the remote hub our

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:02,820
fifth engineering hub co-equal with our

00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,680
other four Engineering hubs in San

00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,680
Francisco Seattle Dublin and Singapore

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,950
and the reason we opened a virtual a

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,590
virtual engineering hub and that would

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,140
be remote I think our CTO nails it in

00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,450
the in the announcement the opening it

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,420
says our users are everywhere so we have

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:23,370
to be as well and at stripe our mission

00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,650
is to increase the Jaypee of the

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,630
Internet and the Internet is global so

00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,970
we need people who understand what our

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,920
users are going through in very

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,330
disparate economies all around the world

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,640
but there what it's like just on the

00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:37,380
ground so that's a great reason for

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,690
straight to build a remote hub and have

00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,520
people all around the world but that may

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,620
not apply to everyone no maybe you're

00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,630
focused on a local market or maybe your

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,670
company is planning on growing in a

00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:50,310
bootstrap manner instead of taking

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:52,050
venture money so why should having a

00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,520
remote hub be part of your engineering

00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:56,830
strategy as well

00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,410
if you take away nothing else from this

00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,910
talk I hope it's this slide when you're

00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,520
forming your company's cultures and

00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,620
norms remember that if you that the best

00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,100
practices for operating remotely at

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,990
scale

00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,600
are also the best practices for

00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:13,210
operating at scale period if you want to

00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,100
create an efficient resilient highly

00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:17,170
available engineering organization and

00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,270
have software architecture that matches

00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,820
that you're going to end up doing at

00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:23,950
least 80% of what's needed in order to

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:27,040
enable remote work for your engineers in

00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:29,230
the end many teams will actually end up

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,030
being able to operate remotely maybe not

00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:33,010
every single person on every single team

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,080
but a lot of them will because the

00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,790
engineering practices that you're going

00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,270
to need in order to scale will set you

00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,820
up for that

00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,680
and conversely an engineering team

00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,630
that's heavily optimized for in-person

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,490
workflows is going to need to adapt

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,130
those strategies in order to maintain

00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:50,380
that same level of flexibility at scale

00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:52,900
and as it turns out those adaptations

00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,540
are mostly the same ones that facilitate

00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,880
remote work we can put this in

00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:00,340
engineering terms as well would you

00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,310
rather have to do a zero downtime

00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:05,440
migration of some fundamental piece of

00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,530
infrastructure and wait to do this until

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,200
you hit scale or would you rather make

00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:15,610
flexible and scalable decisions from the

00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:17,890
very start you know as engineers we know

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,540
migrations are a pain especially zero

00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:21,250
downtime migrations and so since it's

00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,110
much harder to change working practices

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,420
and it is to establish good habits from

00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,280
the beginning why not keep an eye on

00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,350
remote friendly workflows from the start

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,760
even if you don't adapt them all from

00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,740
the adopt the mouth in the beginning

00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,540
keeping an eye on those as a goal will

00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,730
give you a framework to help you in the

00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,870
moment make decisions that are going to

00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,870
then scale long term

00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,600
now sometimes people are hesitant they

00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,250
think that remote work causes problems

00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,440
you you'd hear this often especially

00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,990
like you know six months a year ago that

00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,880
will be tried remote work but it led to

00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,310
communication breakdown led to you know

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,590
culture split on their productivity was

00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,150
an issue and while I think that those

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,620
are valid concerns I also think that

00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,190
there's a more constructive way to look

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,490
at it

00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:09,500
your company is a dynamic system just

00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,030
like the human body you have multiple

00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,310
organs that are working together just

00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,800
like to use in your in your company to

00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,750
accomplish a broader goal and sometimes

00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,580
there are issues either with an isolated

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,880
organ or with the way that different

00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:24,740
organs work together with each other so

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,930
one tool that's used to diagnose those

00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:30,050
issues is nuclear medicine that's

00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:32,180
actually the term um so let's say you

00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,650
know there's an issue with your with

00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,230
your kidneys your renal system how your

00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,000
body's processing water so what doctors

00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,920
will have you do is swallow a small

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,050
amount of basically radioactive water

00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,550
that's somewhat mildly radioactive but

00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,280
it's technically radioactive water and

00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,840
your body will treat that exactly the

00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,880
same way that it treats all you know any

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,170
other water that you'd in jest you'll

00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,460
swallow it it'll go through your stomach

00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,710
I don't you know your kidneys will

00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,780
process it and so forth

00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:59,330
but with one key difference because it's

00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,280
radioactive that water will show up

00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:03,410
right in fluorescent on a certain type

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,080
of imaging skin so it you can actually

00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:08,810
see if there are any issues with how

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,750
your kidneys are functioning so what we

00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,730
found is that remote work is like having

00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,350
these fluorescent indicators it will

00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,270
shine a light on any scaling

00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,130
inefficiencies in your workflows like

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,080
undocumented practices or low bus

00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,540
factors and they'll become visible very

00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,370
quickly it doesn't mean that working

00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,810
remotely causes those issues or that

00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,330
working remotely as an issue of scale

00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,800
it's on the contrary adapting to remote

00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,870
work will make your engineering

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,640
organization more elastic and scalable

00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,890
by shining a light on those issues

00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:40,430
earlier on in the process when it's

00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:43,580
still much easier for you to change them

00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,930
as a friendly note um everything we're

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,760
talking about here is an example so

00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,320
please don't actually swallow any

00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,680
radioactive water or for that matter

00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,169
anything radioactive unless you have

00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,919
doctor's supervision

00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:58,569
and while this other note might sound

00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:01,090
obvious as well I think it's worth being

00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:03,430
explicit on if you're running into

00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:05,680
issues with remote work today that's

00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,389
expected and that's that's normal you

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,189
probably weren't planning for this so

00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:11,800
you're still currently operating in

00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:14,349
reaction mode rather than in planning

00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,180
mode even at stripe where we were we

00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:17,830
were planning ahead pheromone at work

00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,659
we've still had hiccups over the last

00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,460
two months trying to transition that to

00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:25,029
habit the entire organization working

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:27,550
about the simultaneously and for all of

00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:29,830
us we're not just working at home we're

00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,930
at home during a global pandemic trying

00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:34,000
to work so it's easy to attribute any

00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,649
problems that we encounter to remote

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,510
work but really there are a lot of

00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:39,370
confounding factors here so it's

00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:42,930
important to cut yourselves and also

00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:42,930
your colleagues some slack along the way

00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:48,710
now here comes the interesting part the

00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:51,890
answer to that second question how do we

00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,600
work effectively as remote teams so at

00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,670
the beginning of last year I laid out

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,410
three key goals that I wanted to

00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:00,230
accomplish in our first year of having a

00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:02,090
remote hub at stripe now I wanted to

00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,430
expand the breadth of teams that were

00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:06,710
hiring remote engineers I wanted to

00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,780
improve the remote extra work experience

00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:11,030
for remote engineers and I wanted to

00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,160
recruit and hire more remote engineers

00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:14,840
so if you're looking to make remote

00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,910
engineering a long-term strategy at your

00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,590
company today these are probably the

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,630
right three goals to set for your first

00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:22,880
year but of course the question is how

00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,050
to get there and I won't have time to

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,580
share with you all the different

00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,260
projects they've worked on to accomplish

00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,030
all of these goals but I'm definitely

00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,320
happy to chat separately with anyone

00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:33,080
who's interested later in the

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,790
discussions here or or offline and of

00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,800
course in the coming weeks we also plan

00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,360
on publishing a more in-depth look for

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,180
people who want to you know peel back

00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,830
and do a deep dive but since every

00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,720
company situation is different what I'll

00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:47,450
do now is give you a framework that will

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,190
be applicable to you on your team as you

00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:52,089
figure out the right way to tackle these

00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,089
goals for yourselves

00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:58,220
at stripe we're meticulous about the

00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:00,410
foundations we like to reason from first

00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,509
principles and we collect data to inform

00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:04,609
our decisions and then that data also

00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:07,579
helps us know when to revise or shift

00:10:04,609 --> 00:10:09,109
our focus along the way so I already

00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:10,910
outlined the key goals that I wanted to

00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,979
accomplish for the year so then we begin

00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:15,949
with our initial hypotheses about those

00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:19,069
goals we then collect data or evidence

00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:21,049
from the different projects that we that

00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:22,669
we bark on to try and accomplish those

00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:24,799
goals you know those are basically the

00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:26,689
experiments that were running and then

00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:28,549
most importantly we have the findings

00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:31,100
the results that we've learned from each

00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:32,899
step along the way so by sharing with

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,789
you this framework that we used and that

00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:36,559
we still use and showing you how we

00:10:34,789 --> 00:10:38,149
applied it I hope I can give you

00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,069
something practical that you can take

00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:43,899
back to your companies and apply to your

00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:43,899
own unique situations as well

00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:48,560
so the first goal I have is to expand

00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:51,829
the breadth of teams hiring about

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:55,010
engineers and we all know what a

00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:57,680
challenge that hiring can be you know if

00:10:55,010 --> 00:11:00,440
you ask a hiring manager would you like

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,600
to expand the pool of candidates that

00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,209
you're able to consider and hire if I

00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,920
know 10,000 fold you know of course

00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:08,209
they're gonna say absolutely but that

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,220
doesn't mean that they're actually

00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:12,410
necessarily going to go out there and

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,899
start posting remote roles for their

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,880
teams or actively recruiting remote

00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:19,220
people remote candidates to fill those

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,740
roles because we had a chicken-and-egg

00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,660
problem some teams had been remote

00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,660
friendly for a while but some also had

00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:29,240
zero remotes and so we needed a plan to

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,820
transition teams from going from zero

00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,730
modes to one or more remotes on on a

00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,380
team

00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:38,360
so the first thing I did was to co-lead

00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,880
a guide of the common practices that

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,420
were already used by teams that were

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,580
working remotely at stripe and the this

00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,350
wasn't anything that they'd coordinated

00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,390
in advance this was just figuring out

00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,340
what patterns and habits they'd settled

00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:55,610
into naturally and finding the lowest

00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:57,230
common denominator among them uh we plan

00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,210
on sharing this guide in the future but

00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:02,240
as a preview most of it centered around

00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:05,570
the team communication norms and

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,150
especially meeting styles um to give you

00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:10,370
an example one meet one thing that we

00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:13,400
recommend for all teens that have remote

00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:16,010
remote people on them is reserve at

00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,290
least one of your meetings a week for to

00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:19,880
be all remote so everyone dials in

00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:21,200
remotely even if you have five people

00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,210
who are working in an office and three

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,680
people who work remotely don't have

00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,360
those five people sit in the conference

00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,550
room for one meeting a week have

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,500
everyone dial in from their laptops

00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:32,570
separately including them that puts

00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,730
everyone on the same page so everyone's

00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:37,310
feeling the exact same barriers so it's

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:39,140
a level playing field another meeting

00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:41,750
style we recommend for teams to use

00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:45,260
whenever whenever it's helpful is called

00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:48,110
the silent meeting so good a good use of

00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:50,360
it is if you're reviewing a design

00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:51,860
document or a project moved together you

00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,420
reserve the first third of the meeting

00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:57,610
for everyone to sit on a conference call

00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:59,930
together but in silence and everyone is

00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:02,120
collaboratively editing and commenting

00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,500
on a Google Doc together and they'll you

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,660
know responding to each other's comments

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,270
and and working you know semi

00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,770
synchronously and then the rest of the

00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,960
meeting you talk about the stuff that

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:14,570
you'd edited and the discussions that

00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,460
you'd had in the comments the advantage

00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:18,980
of this meeting style is it gives people

00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,660
a little bit more time to collect their

00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,070
thoughts and respond appropriately and

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,900
it addresses some of the issues you

00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:25,850
sometimes having meetings both online

00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,770
and offline where you know people feel

00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,790
are interrupting each other or you know

00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,710
feel like they're not necessarily

00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:32,870
getting heard and get which get

00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:37,490
amplified over the latency of a video

00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:39,500
call and this instead gives people a an

00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,630
asynchronous you notice or a semi-secret

00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,830
is way of talking beforehand and then a

00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:45,910
basis from which to have the

00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:49,480
conversations so we took this

00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:52,210
and then I gave it to two managers were

00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,560
interested in adapting to remote work

00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,420
and he told them to adopt these

00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,790
practices practices as a team as a

00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,830
prerequisite to opening up term at work

00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:02,020
because in order to be successful you

00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:03,610
need everyone to be on board whether or

00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,950
not they are personally working remote

00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,690
it's not just a job of remote engineers

00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:09,760
to make sure that the team supports

00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:12,490
remote work everyone has to be involved

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,650
as well and so as part of getting

00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,630
everyone on board it helped that we were

00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:18,370
able to show them how our existing

00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:20,440
workflows set them up for remote work

00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:22,450
because nobody wants to feel like a

00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,490
guinea pig but everyone wants to feel

00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,870
like they're trying something new so we

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,850
could truthfully tell them look we're

00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,860
not asking you to make a huge shift here

00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,750
we're just asking you to be a bit more

00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,790
conscious and intentional about the

00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:36,040
things are already doing and then treat

00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,990
them in a few ways that that you know

00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:41,610
other teams have found is helpful when

00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,610
easing the transition to remote work

00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,410
so the second goal I had was to improve

00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,329
their work experience for remote

00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:51,420
engineers

00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:53,519
and we have the hypothesis that having a

00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:57,089
remote landing team can help cement or

00:14:53,519 --> 00:15:01,559
to your team's culture as it shifts to

00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:04,439
to remote work so what we began with a

00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:06,689
pilot program where we actually offered

00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:08,699
a you know we told a small number of

00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:11,069
Engineers in the same in the San

00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:13,079
Francisco office that they could work

00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:15,480
remotely from their homes in the Bay

00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:19,079
Area for three months as a pilot program

00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,459
it you know still be based it they'd

00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:22,559
still be working on teams that are based

00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:24,899
in San Francisco but they wouldn't come

00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:27,540
into the office and they'd effectively

00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:29,369
be removed and not gave them an a taste

00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:32,970
of what it's like to work remotely and

00:15:29,369 --> 00:15:34,319
it also gave their teams of a preview of

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:38,129
what it would be like to have remote

00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:40,230
team members and that was a the pilot

00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:41,910
was a huge success in fact I believe

00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,279
every single person who participated in

00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:46,410
it opted to continue working remotely

00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:48,420
even after the pilot had ended and they

00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:50,489
set us up quite well when Cove in

00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,379
nineteen eight because we already knew

00:15:50,489 --> 00:15:54,360
what to expect when asking people to

00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:56,429
transition to working remotely from

00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,410
working in an office of course you know

00:15:56,429 --> 00:16:00,449
one of those situations as voluntary one

00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:04,910
wasn't but it still gave us a baseline

00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:04,910
something that we could a starting point

00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,850
the second hypothesis I had is that

00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,320
being distributed across separate

00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,580
offices is not actually all that

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,550
different from being distributed

00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:16,380
remotely so we could leverage the same

00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,880
strategies and workflows that made us

00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,040
successful as a globally distributed

00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,500
company with offices all around the

00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:25,500
world and use those to be successful

00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,420
with a remote hub as well because we had

00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,040
already we already had offices including

00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,290
engineering offices around the world and

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,930
while most teams are located in a single

00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:36,050
office most work crosses multiple teams

00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:38,190
so people are already used to

00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:41,550
collaborating with people who work in

00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:43,380
different locations and if you're in New

00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:44,730
York doing a one-on-one video conference

00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,230
called there's not really a big

00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,090
difference between calling someone who's

00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,380
based out of an office in London or

00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,090
calling someone who's working out of

00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,250
their home in rural Scotland the same

00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:55,080
timezone it's the same barriers of with

00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,130
video conference calls it's all fun

00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,500
functionally the same

00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:00,000
so as parting as part of learning to

00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,360
work across offices we've already

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,449
adopted both the tools for synchronous

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,920
communication across distances and also

00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:10,350
asynchronous tools for most of our work

00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,959
so we don't do code review by looking

00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:14,400
over someone's shoulder we use github we

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,170
don't do sprint planning by using

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,360
post-it notes in a conference room we

00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:21,290
use JIRA we don't do product development

00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:23,550
on a whiteboard we use Google Docs and

00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:25,920
these are things that we all that we

00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:28,050
adopted long before we created a remote

00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,610
we did them because they're generally

00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,710
good development practices but also

00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:34,680
because people needed them in order to

00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:36,570
work effectively across offices and we

00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:40,250
found that these translate very directly

00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:40,250
towards remote work as well

00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:46,480
um this slide here's my favorite section

00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:50,350
and it's not just because I'm a building

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:53,470
engineer um when a company is very small

00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:55,450
it's it's also my favorite because I

00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:58,170
think it demonstrates very clearly how

00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:01,480
having remote work can be actually a

00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:03,490
force multiplier for your company so

00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,460
when a company is very small it's common

00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:08,050
to have on call an incident response to

00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,210
be handled in a synchronous manner so

00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:11,530
people sitting side by side physically

00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,510
next to each other and working to

00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:15,250
mitigate an issue and there was a period

00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17,890
of early and strikes history where this

00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:19,660
was true for us as well but as we grew

00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:21,550
we needed to scale or process we

00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,650
couldn't afford to have knowledge that

00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:25,330
was spread via word-of-mouth and we

00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,520
couldn't afford to have low bus factors

00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:29,140
so as he became more rigorous about

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,600
documenting the operations of our

00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:34,030
systems that people everywhere could use

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,860
them our incidents response process

00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:38,350
quickly became distributed as well and

00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:40,150
this happened even before long before

00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,920
the creation of remote hub it was just a

00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,710
function of what we needed to do to

00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,630
scale and it's very different difficult

00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:48,670
to scale an organization remotely and

00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:50,560
still have a low bus factor so if you

00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,690
play it right you can actually you know

00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:55,480
do it even earlier that we did use

00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:57,700
building or remote org as a forcing

00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,020
function for having good resiliency

00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,020
engineering ahead of time

00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,560
so what do we learn from our efforts to

00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,960
improve work experience remote engineers

00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:10,180
well it became clear that building a

00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,430
remote hub means building great remote

00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,650
teams it means setting people up for

00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,310
success regardless of where they happen

00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,770
to be working

00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:20,260
and fortunately the best workflows are

00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:22,120
largely the same both for remote and non

00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,900
remote teams you need to create

00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,730
discoverable records of information and

00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,530
we were already prepared for remote

00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:32,200
software engineering practices because

00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:35,230
we already we'd already had to enable

00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,790
these as far as as part of scaling as a

00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,920
globally distributed organization and

00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:40,930
whether or not you're looking to scale

00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,000
globally as well you can still use

00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,660
remote work as a forcing function in

00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,660
that direction

00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:52,179
so final goal I had was to recruit and

00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:54,230
actually hire more remote engineer's and

00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:56,779
at the time that we launch the remote

00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:59,450
hub my hypothesis was that most

00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:02,090
engineering roles can actually be hired

00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:03,769
remotely as long as the team and the

00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:06,169
manager are committed to it that's the

00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:08,240
key prerequisite because we don't view

00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:10,760
the responsibility of remote work as a

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,529
one-way street remote work is as much

00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,600
about setting people up for success as

00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:16,960
it is about the people who are working

00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,960
remote

00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:22,910
pretty good so what we did as an

00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:25,130
experiment was we to collect date on

00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:26,890
this we codify to me simplify the

00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:29,120
requirements for working remotely

00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:30,740
previously we'd expected candidates for

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,360
remote roles to have prior experience

00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,760
working remotely at another company

00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,320
earlier but as we just saw a lot of the

00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,240
skills for working effectively wall and

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,700
remote are really just general

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,280
engineering skills so knowing how to use

00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,860
code review tools use project management

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,840
software or you just communicating

00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,700
effectively and clearly in prose and in

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,440
written documents those are all things

00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,060
that are essential to remote work but

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,880
they're also essential for success and

00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:57,710
more senior engineering roles as well so

00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,300
instead we decided that for engineering

00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,040
roles in the remote hub we would

00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,900
consider more experienced or senior

00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,190
engineering applicants regardless of

00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,310
whether or not they had prior remote

00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,630
experience for new graduates people you

00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,740
know for example somebody's fresh out of

00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,550
school and accepting their first

00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,560
full-time job

00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:14,240
we still would look for prior remote

00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,640
experience when applying to role in the

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,530
remote hub and that doesn't mean that we

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,840
believe that those roles couldn't be

00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:22,550
done remotely it just meant that at the

00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,930
time we made this change a year ago we

00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,640
weren't confident that we would be able

00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:27,680
to provide the support and the career

00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,120
growth resources for someone who is new

00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,140
to both full-time employment

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,140
and to working remotely

00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:38,549
the data here speaks for itself by the

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,830
end of the year we had nearly 200 remote

00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:42,480
engineers at stripe accounting for

00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:45,149
one-fifth of the engineering

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,490
organization and of course as of today

00:21:45,149 --> 00:21:49,529
all of stripe engineers in fact the

00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,779
entire company is working remotely as

00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:53,820
well and the current situation isn't

00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:55,860
permanent we do plan on reopening our

00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,480
offices but the fact that stripe

00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,909
engineers have been working remotely for

00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,679
nearly two months now is the best proof

00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:04,230
from this hypothesis that we can imagine

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,270
in fact we've gone even further our 2020

00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:08,820
summer internships are also all being

00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:11,250
conducted remotely as well previously

00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:14,909
we'd considered internships to be one

00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:16,350
role which required an on-site physical

00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:17,940
presence because you know there

00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:19,830
definitely are advantages to having an

00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,260
internship in a physical office so we

00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:24,210
recognize that this is a contingency

00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,100
arrangement and not our first choice but

00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:28,470
the global situation has shown us that

00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,570
it's possible to open up remote work to

00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:32,340
rules which we'd never consider to be in

00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,410
scope when we launch the remote hub a

00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:36,270
year ago

00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:37,890
and the reason that we've been able to

00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:40,290
move so quickly when adopting remote

00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:42,630
work in response to Cova 19 is because

00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:44,310
we already had the gears in motion we

00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:46,500
didn't need to change direction we were

00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:48,390
just applying the turbo booster to move

00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,870
everything that we already had even

00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,870
faster

00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:56,160
so I began by promising you all the

00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:57,929
answer to two questions the first was

00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,330
why should remote engineering the

00:22:57,929 --> 00:23:02,130
Earth's remote work be our long-term

00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:04,679
strategy instead of just a short-term

00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:07,470
contingency and as you've now seen

00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:10,080
remote work is a forcing function for

00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,610
good engineering practices if you commit

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,860
yourself to making remote work a

00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:15,960
first-class part of your company rather

00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:18,030
than just a temporary workaround you'll

00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,920
be amazed by how much organization

00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:22,890
lamenting you're able to rally for

00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:25,020
top-notch engineering work and the

00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:28,440
second question was how do we have work

00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:29,250
effectively as remote teams I've shared

00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,260
with you a few of the specific

00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,880
strategies that we use at stripe and

00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:35,400
some of those may be helpful to you as

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,200
well but more flexible and powerful is

00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,770
the overall framework that we used to

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:43,170
come up with those strategies and be

00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:45,720
methodical Bement be methodical be

00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:48,120
rigorous don't try to change everything

00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,250
all at once instead identify what's

00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,890
already working well for you either

00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:54,960
offline or online remote or an or in

00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:58,230
person and figure out how to amplify

00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,030
that if you do your you'll find that

00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:02,010
remote work isn't just an option that

00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:03,630
you happen to support at your company it

00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:05,429
can be one of the most powerful and

00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:08,270
indispensable tools that your team has

00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:08,270
at its disposal

00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:11,080
thank you

00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:21,200
Thank You Aditya for that talk on remote

00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:23,120
work I really love the mitten style

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,190
where everybody even though some people

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,080
might be the physical office but

00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:29,600
there'll be some mittens where everybody

00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,480
is fully remote so they can be on an

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,220
even keel and and absolutely take away

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,200
that I got from this that I think I'm

00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:39,080
gonna actually start doing myself it's

00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,820
the silent beginning so that everybody's

00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,820
on the same page and you can just kind

00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:45,049
of compose yourself before you jump into

00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:48,380
the work they all are doing

00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:51,260
synchronously so now the questions that

00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:53,450
the people have been asking people have

00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:55,820
been asking lots and lots of questions

00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,890
about what can remotely so I'm gonna

00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:01,190
take the first one the get up users name

00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:04,000
is tsunami miss I can't pronounce that

00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:07,130
sorry how do you convince your company

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,039
especially one which is quite big more

00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:13,730
than a hundred engineers to support an

00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:15,649
initiative like yours how your remote

00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:18,140
teams can work efficiently with the

00:25:15,649 --> 00:25:19,940
on-site team and they also want to know

00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,980
how are you dealing with the different

00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,950
kinds of communication channels between

00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:27,350
the remote teams and the on-site teams

00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:29,480
so let's just take the first one how do

00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:31,279
you strong convince a company with a

00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,950
large engineering group of more than a

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:38,059
hundred people to take on work in the

00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:41,299
curated a remote hub I did yeah so

00:25:38,059 --> 00:25:42,770
that's a very good question um I I think

00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:45,500
that the answer for that is largely

00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:47,960
going to be situational on what work for

00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:50,870
us may not necessarily be applicable to

00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,580
you but the key is to find figure out

00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,899
what your company actually cares about

00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:57,500
what are the problems you're currently

00:25:53,899 --> 00:26:00,409
having and you know fit in and figure

00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:03,200
out how remote work is going to help or

00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:06,770
amplify those um you know one way is a

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,770
career mobility or retention oftentimes

00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,909
people will have to will have to move in

00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,799
order to you know because of a

00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:15,200
significant other or family

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,669
circumstances and you know it really

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,409
sucks to have to lose a lot of

00:26:16,669 --> 00:26:21,590
institutional knowledge that's that's

00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:23,059
been accumulated just because someone

00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,980
has to make someone has to shift

00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:27,200
locations wouldn't it be great if we

00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:30,260
could actually that along and support

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,090
and provide these these internal

00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:35,179
mobility options for them instead of

00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:37,100
forcing them to have to seek you know a

00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:39,950
job somewhere else that's one angle that

00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:41,450
may work another way is to think about

00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:43,399
you know if your if your company is

00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:45,919
struggling with you know pretty brutal

00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:49,399
on-call rotations think about how having

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,899
people who are distributed in not just

00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,679
different time zones but also different

00:26:50,899 --> 00:26:55,100
countries where you have different

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,779
holidays that might help I will say that

00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,130
you know having time zones can all

00:26:56,779 --> 00:27:00,549
different working across time zones

00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:02,330
presents a different set of challenges

00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:04,940
4:14 so you want to make sure you're

00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:06,500
prepared those as well but figure out

00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,360
what the pain points you're feeling are

00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,760
as a company and figure out how remote

00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,139
work can fit into those rather than

00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,700
trying to fit it the other way around

00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:16,580
that's probably going to be the most

00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:19,929
successful way to approach a company

00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:24,830
that is reluctant or on the fence

00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:26,840
shada yeah yeah so when I saw that Drake

00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:27,799
slide earlier and I heard your phone go

00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:31,820
off I thought you're gonna do the

00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:33,919
hotline bling' dance for us but not

00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:38,659
gonna lie I actually am on call today

00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:41,450
thankfully I don't have a backup so this

00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:42,799
is this I think would be the first time

00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:46,610
that I've actually gotten page during

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:47,870
the middle of a conference talk no

00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,260
that's all cool I was just hoping for a

00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,360
dance

00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:52,130
but the point you made about figuring

00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,139
out remote being synonymous with

00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:55,580
figuring out scale I think you're right

00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,440
on but what about the really small

00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:59,389
organizations who necessarily don't

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,919
necessarily want to scale did they think

00:27:59,389 --> 00:28:05,450
about remote yeah absolutely so um I

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,169
touched on this but only but only

00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:11,720
briefly um you might you might be

00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:14,419
focused on just having a local local

00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,980
market or you know you might be trying

00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:18,500
to bootstrap ourselves and I'm growing

00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:21,909
very yes but that doesn't mean that you

00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:24,529
don't want to be a flexible and and

00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:26,809
adaptable company you know a current

00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:28,880
situation has shown us that you know

00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:30,590
markets can change you know and whether

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,299
that's because of something called oh

00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:34,039
that's happening or just the market that

00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:37,129
you're tackling or just where you happen

00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:38,690
to be geographically and remote work

00:28:37,129 --> 00:28:39,399
will free you from some of those

00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:40,839
limitations

00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:42,639
not all of them but ill for you from a

00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:44,919
lot of them and it will allow you to

00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:47,289
move much much more nimbly at whatever

00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:49,509
scale you're operating then it would be

00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:52,479
a few than it would be if you'd focus

00:28:49,509 --> 00:28:54,669
your entire presence around having you

00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:57,249
know a physical office that is central

00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:58,749
to your workflows yeah that's right on

00:28:57,249 --> 00:29:00,940
that's a good point I'm owed you I think

00:28:58,749 --> 00:29:02,469
we've got time for one more yeah just

00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:05,849
one more a very short one have you

00:29:02,469 --> 00:29:09,609
discovered any downsides to remote work

00:29:05,849 --> 00:29:11,219
um yeah so I think I don't know if I'd

00:29:09,609 --> 00:29:13,749
classify this as a downside but

00:29:11,219 --> 00:29:14,769
something to be aware of is just it not

00:29:13,749 --> 00:29:17,080
it's not for everyone

00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:19,899
um in fact it's funny because remote

00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:22,059
work isn't just I I kind of completed

00:29:19,899 --> 00:29:23,589
this it's not just working at home it

00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:25,239
can also be working you know at a

00:29:23,589 --> 00:29:26,440
separate space that's not your home and

00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:28,059
there's something I personally have

00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,739
struggled with because I've been working

00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:31,539
remotely for five years but normally in

00:29:29,739 --> 00:29:32,919
a co-working space so in the last two

00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:35,619
months adopting and working out of my

00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:37,359
apartments been a big shift so you have

00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:39,070
to keep in mind that people need to

00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:41,019
people need the flexibility to set

00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:42,549
ideally people need the flexibility to

00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:44,799
set up their workspaces and their work

00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:46,419
situations the way they want and some

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,279
people might might still prefer a

00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:50,129
physical office but that doesn't mean we

00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:53,219
can't provide both options to people

00:29:50,129 --> 00:29:56,019
depending on what works best for them

00:29:53,219 --> 00:29:58,649
thank you thank you a dta that's gonna

00:29:56,019 --> 00:29:58,649
be our last question

00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,679
