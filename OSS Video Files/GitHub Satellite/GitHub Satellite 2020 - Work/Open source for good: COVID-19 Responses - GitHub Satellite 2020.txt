responses this panel is gonna discuss

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,980
what we've learned from other

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,870
humanitarian crisis when it comes to

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,610
using open source solutions we're going

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,020
to delve deeper into each solutions con

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,270
carrot and hear from a group that

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,000
utilized Comcare to forge open source

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,160
solutions for african code 19 response

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,460
toolkit I'm really excited to have

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,160
Mollica Mark Clayton sim Alexander

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,170
Gregor Mike andele and Linda Raftery

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,320
joining us for this exciting

00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:45,000
conversation

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:47,399
take it away mala hi thanks so much Dana

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,600
Martin can everybody hear me okay oh I

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,489
guess I'll take that as a yes welcome

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,210
everyone to the open source for good

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,620
Cova 19 pandemic responses panel so my

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,870
name is mala and I'm a program manager

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,329
here at github on our social impact team

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,369
I run a program called open source for

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,990
good some of you might be familiar some

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:08,729
of you less oh and for those of you who

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,560
aren't familiar the broad remit of open

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,360
source for good is to essentially make

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,790
open source work better for humanity

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,259
it's a bit of a lofty goal but the way

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,580
that we tend to approach that is by

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,830
working with what we call the social

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,380
sector so any organization whether it's

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,600
for-profit or nonprofit international or

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,640
US domestic facing we work with those

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,470
organs organizations to figure out how

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,380
we can make open source more accessible

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,780
more relatable and easier to access for

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,210
appropriate solutions and the in the

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,240
social sector I'm really happy that

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,280
after a year of research last month we

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,200
published our report open source

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,420
software in the social sector which

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,159
examines the barriers successes and

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,070
opportunities at the intersection of

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,990
open source and the social sector you

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,430
can access the report for free don't

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,259
need to give any information you can

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,119
access the report and you can learn more

00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:02,880
about the github social impact team at

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:04,140
social impact github calm so today I'm

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,990
going to be the moderator for this panel

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,520
and I'm joined by four amazing panelists

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,959
who are going to talk about different

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,030
aspects of open source whether it's

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,970
implementing and deploying an open

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,430
source solution when it

00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,840
- koba 19 or whether it's thinking about

00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,580
the design and what are some of the

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,530
considerations and lessons learned that

00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,960
we can take from past humanitarian

00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,990
crises specifically in public health I'm

00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,120
joined by four fantastic panelists linda

00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:30,580
Raftery who is the convener of text LAN

00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,380
and Braille tech clayton sims who's the

00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,600
chief technology officer over at de

00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:37,150
maggie mic and dolly who's the

00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,700
co-founder of the africa kovat 19

00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,590
response toolkit and alexander grigory

00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,210
who's the chief product officer of sim

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,840
prince welcome to the panelists and

00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:48,700
thank you so much for being here stay

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,740
now obviously Cova 19 has affected

00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,410
pretty much every aspect of our life and

00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:56,020
it's it's personal it's emotional and at

00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,610
times it's just flat-out overwhelming we

00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,709
understand that it's social impact but

00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,420
as a social impact team it's our job to

00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:03,459
understand how it's affecting the world

00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,830
and so through many conversations

00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:07,780
thousands of conversations and articles

00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,480
and from our greater social sector

00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,490
network at the social impact team kind

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,320
of narrowed down how koban 19 is

00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:17,920
relating to the world in three basic

00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,860
ways or in three broad categories the

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,090
first category is what we call societal

00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,800
societal has everything to do with

00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,080
mental health of both individuals and

00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,180
populations it has to do with the

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,040
incredibly unfortunate rise in domestic

00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,500
and child abuse that's as a result of

00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,840
shelter and place orders worldwide it

00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,519
also has to do with the also incredible

00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,800
incredibly unfortunate rise in global

00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:40,870
hunger as unemployment goes up and as

00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,519
supply chains are affected are affecting

00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,709
through aid and food assistance across

00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:46,180
the world and then of course societal

00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:48,750
also has to do with this distance

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,680
learning for the first time ever

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,630
hundreds and millions of children across

00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,250
the world who usually have access to

00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,989
traditional traditional classrooms are

00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,420
now learning away from those classrooms

00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:00,519
and so at a societal level we have to

00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:04,290
think about how we educate our children

00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:06,780
and our youth in the coming years

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,830
another category is economic

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,480
unemployment in the United States is at

00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,920
one of the all-time highs in the history

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,019
of our country we have currently about

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,850
30 million cases of unemployment that

00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:17,769
have been reported and then worldwide

00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:19,540
we're seeing spikes in unemployment

00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:21,640
especially in the informal sectors

00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,039
throughout sub-saharan Africa South Asia

00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,030
and Latin America and unemployment also

00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:27,680
ties in directly to housing

00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,290
the economic category also includes

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,330
market volatility not just stock markets

00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:35,180
but consumer markets and in some extreme

00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:37,520
cases such as in certain segments of the

00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,980
tourism industry even possible collapse

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,830
and then the economic category also

00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:46,460
affects the ever complex issue of global

00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:49,100
trading now as you probably guess from

00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:51,650
the title of this panel we are focusing

00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,840
on this last category pandemic solutions

00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:57,260
or pandemic responses as a result of

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,000
kovat 19 pandemic looks at both the case

00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,470
fatality and mortality rate case

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,210
fatality being the number of people who

00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:04,120
have died of Koba 19 versus the number

00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,710
of people who have been affected and

00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,810
mortalities often expressed as the

00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,870
number of people who have died of Koba

00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:14,000
19 as against the a certain number of

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,850
the population like 100,000 people in a

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,830
population pandemic also looks at the

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,419
spread of the corona virus both the

00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,130
trajectory of the disease how its

00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:23,750
transmitted and the number of people an

00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,669
infected person can then go and infect

00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,710
themselves and then for those of us who

00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:30,290
are here in New York City or in other

00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,760
epicenters pandemic responses also have

00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,720
to do with healthcare capacity and

00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,720
personal protective equipment

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,340
distribution in the longer term we're

00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,800
looking at how vaccines are going to be

00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,300
affected for over nineteen and then in

00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,070
the shorter incremental term community

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:47,030
communication and awareness of the

00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:49,220
disease itself so when we talk about

00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,690
pandemic responses we are actually

00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,520
largely talking about this idea of

00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,320
Public Health which is not just the

00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,160
health care of an individual but of a

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,810
population as a whole so the medical the

00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,820
psychological the health systems the

00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,770
behavior the communication and the

00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,530
awareness of a disease and how it

00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,880
impacts a society interestingly enough

00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,100
open source actually has a long history

00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,630
with global Public Health and we're

00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:16,760
proud of github that we play a central

00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:19,610
role in that one example is the District

00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,680
Health Information survey which is also

00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:24,169
known as DHI s2 which has been deployed

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,970
to sixty-seven low and middle-income

00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:27,800
countries making it the largest health

00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,990
management information system in the

00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,850
world it's an open-source tool that's

00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,169
hosted on github it's incredibly

00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,270
pervasive across the public health

00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:37,370
ecosystem in fact in my previous life

00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,229
prior to joining github when I was at

00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,230
the United Nations I worked with DHI is

00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:42,690
- in Kenya

00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,580
Rindy we're very proud to host John

00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:48,630
github and to be a part of this global

00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:50,310
public health ecosystem so one of the

00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:54,120
interesting things themes that you hear

00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:56,010
in today's panel is that because we have

00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,720
a lot a long history of open source and

00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,610
global public health we can actually be

00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,680
adapting and learning lessons from

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,090
previous humanitarian and public health

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,980
crises in low and middle income

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,600
countries and applying that to what's

00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,150
happening here in the United States and

00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,440
in Europe and really worldwide and so to

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,110
take you some through some of those

00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,850
considerations I'm happy to pass it on

00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,080
to Linda Raftery who's gonna walk you

00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:20,940
through some of those from her previous

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,050
experience Linda over to you thanks mala

00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,750
thanks everybody for coming to our

00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,640
session today I'm glad to be here to

00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:31,230
tell you a little bit about how we work

00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:34,620
on technology in the social sector my

00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:36,390
work is is really making sure that that

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,070
technology is bringing positive impacts

00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,900
in and making sure it's not bringing a

00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,490
negative impacts or causing harm to

00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,650
vulnerable people so I'm really kind of

00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,270
like an anthropologist of technology and

00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,830
that's really where I work I'm going to

00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,930
talk to you today about three questions

00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,940
that we usually ask when we're trying to

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,080
bring check in during a crisis one does

00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,640
it solve a real problem

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,070
two does it link to the wider ecosystem

00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:58,920
and three what is the potential for harm

00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:00,870
now and later so if we go to the first

00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,550
question does it solve a real problem

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,020
here we want to think about what's the

00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,570
research that we've done do we

00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,340
understand the context have we talked to

00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,230
other people do we know that the people

00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,250
that we are supposed to be you know

00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,960
trying to help

00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,430
are we actually helping them do we know

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,910
what they need what they want how they

00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:18,930
hardly work what their challenges are we

00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:22,590
want to think about whether technology

00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:24,750
is actually a solution sometimes we try

00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,010
to bring technology in and it's actually

00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,660
not going to solve a problem because the

00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,920
problem is not something that technology

00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,570
can solve it might be a political

00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,580
problem it might be a problem with

00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,650
infrastructure might be a problem of

00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,660
funding or biased discrimination there

00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,979
are all kinds of problems that that

00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,810
sometimes technology actually

00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,250
contributes to rather than solving and

00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,720
then we want to make sure that the tech

00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,610
is appropriate for the place that we're

00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,040
working in during that crisis in Haiti

00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:49,080
we had people that were building iPhone

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,460
applications for people in Haiti and we

00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,010
knew that most people who were working

00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,640
who were living in Haiti and really

00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,800
affected by the

00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,970
we're using basic Nokia phones so things

00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,890
people were building we're completely

00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,140
irrelevant to the the people that they

00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,910
were thinking they were trying to help

00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:05,640
the second one is around linking to the

00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,750
wider ecosystem um and here we really

00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,760
want to think about what's already there

00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,990
if you're working in tech you know that

00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,850
there's a tech ecosystem that's

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,620
interesting to be interoperable that you

00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,269
probably want to feed into but what

00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,829
about all the other ecosystems that are

00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:18,480
there there are data systems there are

00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:21,000
health systems social systems economic

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,620
systems that we want to try to build

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,110
around and build in so that we're not

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,970
creating parallel systems we also want

00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,640
to build systems that people already are

00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,380
using not build them but add on to

00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,420
systems that people are already using so

00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,370
that there's greater up to so you don't

00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,870
want to kind of come in and try to

00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:38,370
disrupt everything everything's already

00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,260
been quite disrupted because you're in a

00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,820
crisis situation so what you want to do

00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,839
is figure out what do people already

00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,579
know what are they already comfortable

00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,019
with and how can you build that and make

00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:47,550
that work for them better maybe by

00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,260
adding a small feature or tweaks or

00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,190
something like that of course you want

00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,670
to make sure that what you're doing is

00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,829
illegal

00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,350
that's just kind of across the board and

00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:58,500
the last one that I want to talk about

00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:59,519
is this potential for harm so you know

00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,140
here we want to make sure that we're

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,060
conducting risk benefits harms

00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,860
assessments um a lot of times we we

00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,990
conduct risk assessments and think about

00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,519
the risk to ourselves in our company we

00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,230
also want to be thinking about the risk

00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,120
to the people that were working with and

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,890
making sure that it's not the poorest

00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,420
people or the most vulnerable people who

00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,310
are taking on the majority of the risk

00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,690
we've been hearing a lot about that and

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,850
now with coded and some of the

00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,949
overreaches and privacy we want to think

00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:25,199
about short and long term impacts as

00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:26,490
well not just fixing things right now

00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:28,709
but thinking about what could be the

00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:31,140
potential impacts of those fixes in the

00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:33,329
long term you want to make sure that

00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,579
we've involved users or stakeholders in

00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:36,570
those risks benefits harms assessments

00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:38,370
to make sure that we're hearing from

00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,290
them about what potential dangers or

00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,430
risks that they might see are and we

00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,320
want to make sure that we're setting up

00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,000
data governance systems that can make

00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,170
sure that we're being responsible and

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,339
that there's transparency and

00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,199
accountability in the way that we're

00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,760
working so those are just you know three

00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:53,130
questions you can ask yourself as you're

00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,260
thinking about engaging in a tech

00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,730
project in a crisis to make sure that

00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,579
you're kind of learning from what we've

00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:01,140
done in the past and not causing harm

00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:04,399
I'm going to hand over to Clayton now to

00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,399
talk to you about his work

00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,760
great thanks so much Linda hi everybody

00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:12,340
my name is Clayton and I am the CTO over

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,870
at domani we are a Boston based social

00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,790
enterprise that builds the Comcare

00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,830
software platform and I've been working

00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:19,480
in global health for about 15 years and

00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:21,040
this last year is we've been responding

00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,050
kovin 19 it's been one of the craziest

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,850
of my career but really not for the

00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,170
reasons that I expected and to explain

00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,210
why on the next slide I'm going to tell

00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,220
you guys a story and that story starts

00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:31,600
in Silicon Valley which is a place that

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,490
in your mind right reason which is like

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,800
vending machines full of Apple products

00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:37,570
or obnoxious bikes the Googlers used for

00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,160
group meetings Silicon Valley is the

00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,080
epicenter of technology in the United

00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,340
States and unfortunately on the next

00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,840
slide you can see that earlier this year

00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,670
it was the epicenter of a different kind

00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,770
it was the site of one of the first

00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:50,410
outbreaks of Cogan 19 on the u.s. west

00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:52,630
coast on March 10th ten percent of the

00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,890
known coronavirus cases in the US for

00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,600
located in Silicon Valley

00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:57,550
now fitting to their identity the valley

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,870
was also early using technology to go on

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,120
the offensive against Cove in nineteen

00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,770
on April fifteenth Silicon Valley was

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,750
the first major US city to launch

00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,490
full-contact racing efforts and in

00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,680
effect torture all the virus in their

00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,910
population but you might find surprising

00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,650
though is that that technology that

00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,870
they're using in this fight it's not

00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:15,970
magic from Apple or Google but our

00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:17,830
software conquer being used to support

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,300
the efforts of an army of contract

00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,160
racers who are doing old-school

00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,960
if you were coordinated by UCSF and

00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,520
honestly I'm still a little bit stunned

00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,150
that the best available tools for San

00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,950
Francisco

00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,810
there's DBH headquarters I think two

00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:30,400
blocks literally away from Twitter are

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,200
the same ones that we use to track

00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,060
newborn health outcomes in rural India

00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,200
but it makes a lot more sense when you

00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,420
know a different story that I'm going to

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,640
say but on the next slide I got a news

00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,350
notification on March 4th that ogen

00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,570
state in Nigeria they'd loves their own

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:46,450
contact tracing system in many cases of

00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:48,520
koban 1990 area have it March for one an

00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,980
important case that entered the country

00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,900
two days earlier in strat global health

00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,390
services used calm care to build that

00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:57,190
contact tracing system in 24 hours and

00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,180
the state was already piling on rolling

00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,180
it out to the primary and secondary

00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:03,190
health care systems 48 hours later this

00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,570
is a really representative of our

00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,860
experience working in low and middle

00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,420
income countries and responding to cope

00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,040
in nineteen the government of Sierra

00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,510
Leone they were recruiting different

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,490
digital tools for copa90 mother's a

00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:14,260
single Keith in the country the most

00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,850
unexpected part of the year for me has

00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,040
been that most of my time hasn't been

00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,880
spent facilitating responses in Africa

00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,680
or Asia or most

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,180
our fixed place since a lot of those

00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,980
teams are using Comcare something else

00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,660
in their own autonomously said most of

00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,880
my time has been spent hoping teams in

00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,860
the u.s. understand and adopt that same

00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,210
rapid approach now the next slide before

00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,860
explaining that tools these teams are

00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,180
using for contact tracing it'll be

00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,130
helpful to understand the underlying

00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,750
technology they're built on so conker is

00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,830
an open-source no code and user

00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,020
programming environment lets

00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:43,090
organizations build deploy and maintain

00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,530
applications that work on browsers or

00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,420
offline on mobile devices without

00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:48,610
meaning programmers we've built this to

00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,380
make high complexity apps available to

00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,330
organizations who otherwise wouldn't

00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,160
have the resources to deploy or maintain

00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,660
custom software this is virtually

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,700
conquer the largest M health app

00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:59,110
platform in the world five hundred

00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,940
million people are registered for

00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:02,530
services in a conquer app that's just

00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,540
under 7 percent of the global population

00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:06,220
now on the next slide you can see an

00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,780
example one of these apps this is a

00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,550
quick diagram that lays out the workflow

00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,470
for a template application that we

00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,210
released in March and then encodes the

00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:15,310
data collection decision support and

00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:17,110
long-term tracking from the WTO's

00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,490
contact tracing and monitoring protocol

00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,770
and everything you see on the screen

00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,840
here it was built in Comcare the menus

00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:24,760
the data models the logic and the power

00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,010
of that is that organizations are able

00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,690
to import this application template but

00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,670
then further customize the app for their

00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:32,170
context starting with 95% of the problem

00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,580
already solved and this template only

00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,590
took us about a week to build and come

00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,330
care but it was downloaded by 500

00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:40,360
organizations in the first 24 hours

00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:42,040
after its release saving 500 collective

00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,290
weeks of response time is really

00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,550
valuable in an epidemic template apps

00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:47,050
are a really good illustration of how

00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,390
the larger global development community

00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:51,400
approaches technology accelerating the

00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,990
reach and speed of deploying tools but

00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,640
always making sure that we're putting

00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,180
autonomy in the hands of the teams that

00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,070
need it most

00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,990
so the last slide here we never actually

00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:00,250
designed to conquer specific design

00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:02,770
tools or share them for outbreak

00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:04,690
response but back in 2014 Columbia

00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:06,670
University used Comcare to build the

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,440
deploy contact tracing tools for Sierra

00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,700
Leone's Ebola outbreak and there she had

00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,350
an app on our exchange and it was

00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,300
adopted by teams all across the West

00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:14,770
Africa region to fight the disease once

00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,390
we understood the value of our tools in

00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:18,220
that context we eventually took an

00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:19,810
active role in helping build and deploy

00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,030
templates for every phase of the disease

00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,770
- contact tracing but things like

00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:25,870
protocols for decommissioning emergency

00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:27,520
hospitals or providing services all

00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:29,290
neural children who became orphans due

00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,610
to the deadly outbreak this is something

00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:32,230
we're building on much more proactively

00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,730
for copa90 when we realized this isn't

00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,590
going to be a

00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,720
free month response we've built seven

00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:38,250
templates to facilitate health systems

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,140
responding to different aspects of the

00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,250
impact of coronavirus in the spirit of

00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,930
our open source routes we're also

00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,550
excited to help the community to deploy

00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,680
and show their own templates as well

00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:47,640
since succeeding in controlling Koba 19

00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,200
it's going to take the strengths of

00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,330
every member of the global development

00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,380
community not just one and that's

00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,910
something that Mike's going to talk

00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,190
about a little bit more with his work on

00:15:53,910 --> 00:16:00,000
the Africa covin 19 response toolkit so

00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:02,630
do you like awesome thank you so much to

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,670
Clayton and I am Mike and Allah

00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:08,910
originally from Ethiopia and I'm part of

00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:12,630
Africa covered 19 responses toolkit team

00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:16,680
so our journey to Kovac 19 response

00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:19,290
starts with a single tweet this is two

00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,300
days after the eto peon data been

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:25,710
government announced that they confirmed

00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:27,450
two cases and a hacker that I am just

00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:29,640
sent the tweets asking for other hackers

00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:32,010
to come together and build a set of

00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:35,160
tools to help what we found out in the

00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:37,140
next slide what we found out was about

00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,710
sixteen hundred people showed up to help

00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:43,230
these are doctors designers project

00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:46,200
managers everybody jumped in to help

00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:47,730
asking how they can help in the early

00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,940
insight that we had is what Clayton

00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:52,980
mentioned and what Linda also talked

00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,380
about which is building on top of

00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,660
existing ecosystem was a single most

00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,570
important thing that anybody can do

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:03,000
since we are racing against time so

00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:04,740
these groups came together these are

00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,949
passionate a group of people who came

00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:10,650
and focused on delivery more than

00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:13,440
anything and where as a result we are

00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:15,630
building a set of 10 products all of

00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:18,660
them hosted an open source from github

00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:22,320
and they provide a turnkey solution to

00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:25,140
actually run quickly to respond to covet

00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,750
90 but our model is important at the

00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:31,080
beginning of this journey we set a very

00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:33,090
tactful goal of speed over perfection

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,060
this was a single important thing that

00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:38,490
we did as we are racing against time and

00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:40,080
allowing these local civic organizations

00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,260
to be able to respond to fact the reason

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,480
most important

00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,520
so in the next slide we'll show you how

00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,170
we fit everything together and as you

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,440
know no single product is gonna solve

00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:53,980
everything so whenever that we saw a gap

00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,690
we jumped in and one of the ten product

00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:58,150
that we're building is addressing those

00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:00,790
specific cases so if you have a Comcare

00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:02,890
idea tries to perfect well and good you

00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:05,800
should run with it and whenever you have

00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:07,900
gaps in your ecosystem that's where the

00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,390
toolkit is gonna be super helpful to you

00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:13,240
the point is as you can see on the next

00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:15,910
slide is the point is to provide a

00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:19,050
purpose-built product that is specific

00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:21,310
to our learning of kovat 19 tools and

00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:23,650
making sure that you have a single

00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:25,450
turnkey solution that you can use and

00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,490
the products are beautifully designed

00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:29,440
and on the next slide we have some demos

00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:31,930
for you but it's beautifully designed

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,240
India will be effective within the

00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:35,650
organization that you already have some

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,600
of the most important things that we've

00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:39,580
learned as if anybody can tell you and

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,920
responding to any type of disaster is

00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:44,200
its incremental changes are infinitely

00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:47,170
more important than any big bank

00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,030
solution and to that end I think our

00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:51,460
products the product the project that

00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:54,520
we're supporting can be run individually

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:57,640
or as a whole and it can be the single

00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:59,620
most critical aspect of your kovat 19

00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,230
response we understand technology is not

00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:03,880
the only solution and alex is gonna talk

00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:07,440
about some of the important work she's

00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,440
doing Alex over to you

00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:14,570
um hi everyone I'm Alexandra the CTO

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,539
confounder of sim prints a non profit

00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:19,549
company from Cambridge UK building tech

00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:22,370
tools for international development as

00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:24,980
we heard from Megan Clayton digital

00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,659
tools are critical for global health and

00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,759
they become exponentially more important

00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:30,889
in a global pandemic I will talk about

00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:32,750
one challenge that many programs that

00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:35,480
are implementing these tools are facing

00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:38,590
and it has to do with the lack of unique

00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:41,299
patient identifiers next slide please so

00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:42,919
the problem is that in many developing

00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:45,710
countries there are no robust national

00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:48,289
IT systems and service providers can't

00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:50,440
rely on traditional ID methods like

00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:53,929
national ID cards or birth certificates

00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:56,720
Social Security numbers and so on so the

00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:58,730
consequence is that ensuring that the

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,710
right services are being delivered to

00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:03,379
the right people becomes extremely

00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:05,720
difficult so for the past five years at

00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:07,610
sim prints we have built biometric tools

00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,710
that are helping health care workers

00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:12,350
around the world deliver better services

00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:14,210
we integrated these tools with most open

00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:16,759
source data platforms like the ones

00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:17,960
mentioned by Megan Clayton to provide

00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:20,149
unique identifiers

00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:23,149
based on fingerprint or face recognition

00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:25,610
in a secure way while maintaining the

00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:27,230
privacy of the individual so far we

00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,940
deployed in 12 countries working with

00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:31,429
NGOs and governments across sub-saharan

00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:33,379
Africa and South Asia enrolling and

00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:35,809
identifying more than 400,000 patients

00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:39,259
and improve the delivery of healthcare

00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:41,750
of healthcare services in the next slide

00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:43,850
we can see that the need of a reliable

00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,769
ID in crisis response has been

00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:48,350
recognized by the World Bank as a lesson

00:20:45,769 --> 00:20:50,779
learned from the Ebola epidemic digital

00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,730
IDs based on biometrics when implemented

00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:55,549
have been critical for contact tracing

00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:58,789
as well as distribution and care of cash

00:20:55,549 --> 00:21:00,830
and aid basically without being able to

00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:02,629
track an individual and the treatment

00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:04,399
they receive it's really difficult to

00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:06,559
contain the spread of the disease as

00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:08,570
well as allocating resources effectively

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,200
especially when those resources are

00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:13,490
scarce next slide

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,740
we've been working on a face recognition

00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:18,259
solution as specifically for coverage

00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,010
that can be plugged into the coffee

00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:21,410
response

00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:23,930
apps linking patients with their records

00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:25,820
through a unique ID that is randomly

00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:28,520
generated and linked with their

00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:30,350
biometrics the Robo metric data is then

00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:33,470
deleted for security reasons and the

00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:35,660
hash template is further used for

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,460
matching and there are multiple use

00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,530
cases for biometrics in this response

00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,510
we're now working with various partners

00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:43,520
to implement the solution particularly

00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:46,520
for contact tracing and ensuring

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,440
continuity of follow-up as well as

00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,060
preparing ourselves for a future vaccine

00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,000
distribution where accurate

00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:55,790
identification will be crucial to ensure

00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,220
nobody is missed and on the right hand

00:21:55,790 --> 00:22:00,320
side you can see a demo of the concur

00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:03,140
contact tracing application Clayton has

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,480
shown earlier with the integrated face

00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:10,040
biometrics to provide this unique

00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:11,180
patient identifier and lastly you might

00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:15,050
wonder what the dissolution is

00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:18,200
open-source as well next slide please

00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:20,510
and the answer is not yet

00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,630
while we started same prints with this

00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:26,510
vision in mind doing open source right

00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:28,910
is not easy and I think Mike and Clayton

00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:31,130
can confirm this first of all there are

00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:32,660
no open source digital ID platforms out

00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,460
there used for healthcare interventions

00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,950
in particular so there are not good

00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:39,290
examples for us to learn from and we're

00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:41,090
very very keen to be pioneers in this

00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:43,190
space but we need to make sure we are

00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:45,410
doing it properly specifically as

00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,820
biometrics is a sensitive topic where

00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:48,860
data protection and privacy are

00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:51,200
incredibly important we need to be

00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:53,420
careful and think how can we make sure

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,730
that this solution will not be used for

00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,410
harm how can we limit the scope of use

00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:59,330
for global development and keep

00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:01,490
maintaining the high privacy standards

00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:03,470
we have in our projects such as running

00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:05,390
community sensitization campaigns using

00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,970
informed consent adhering to TTP our

00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:11,180
regulations particularly as the context

00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:14,030
that we're working in deal with very

00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:15,350
vulnerable populations and lastly doing

00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,970
open source properly requires

00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:18,590
significant investment we need a

00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:20,930
dedicated team we need to build a

00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:23,120
community and maintain it and finding

00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:25,220
the right funding as a young nonprofit

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,610
working in the global health space is

00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:30,200
challenging if you have any ideas about

00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:32,180
how an open source IP platforms could

00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,820
work specifically in the technology for

00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,529
development

00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,960
Li's getting that Geum I'd love to

00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:42,750
brainstorm and collaborate over to you

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:44,490
more great thanks so much Alexandra and

00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,840
thanks so much to all our panelists I've

00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,610
had the privilege of working in global

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,799
health across sub-saharan Africa for

00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:51,360
quite a while and I have to say working

00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:53,039
with you all has been wonderful and I've

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,639
learned so much about how we should

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:58,830
approach Copa 19 pandemic responses I'm

00:23:56,639 --> 00:24:00,120
sure our audience members some of you

00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,860
might be a bit overwhelmed with the

00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,630
information and some of you are probably

00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,759
ready to jump in and get started on

00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:07,620
helping so please do take a screenshot

00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:09,870
of the slide and feel free to reach out

00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:13,830
to our panelists through Twitter on

00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:15,179
github and on LinkedIn so in just about

00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:17,279
five minutes we're gonna be moving over

00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:21,960
to the discussion thread but I wanted to

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:24,750
kick off the Q&A here on on our with our

00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,519
panel and I'll ask the question that I'm

00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,320
sure is burning in every audience

00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:30,929
members mind which is how do I get

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,549
involved Mike and Alex can you kick us

00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:37,019
off what are some ways that our github

00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:39,000
community can get involved yeah the best

00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:40,860
place and thanks for that question but

00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,370
the best place to start is our get out

00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:46,110
page and you know you start with a get

00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:48,029
out page we have community and you can

00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:50,669
grab any one of the projects that we're

00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:53,309
working on and adapt it and make a

00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:54,570
change in you know create a PR one of

00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:57,720
the things that we're really proud of

00:24:54,570 --> 00:25:00,690
with the Africa cover-to-cover 19

00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,759
response toolkit is it's available

00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:05,610
individually or it can be used as a

00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:08,250
whole and my hope is and our that the

00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:10,350
teams hope is to actually the adoption

00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:12,090
within African countries especially the

00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:14,759
ones they needed the most would use it

00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:16,350
immediately by just grabbing forking it

00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:17,990
directly from our github that would be

00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:20,840
the best place to start

00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:22,520
yeah absolutely so for those audience

00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,799
members who are driving in from Africa

00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,330
in contact with Mike or get in contact

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,460
with me and I'll get you in contact with

00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:29,899
Mike because what Mike is designing is

00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,510
really a turnkey solution that can be

00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:34,399
implemented all throughout the continent

00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:36,110
Alex what are some ways that the github

00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:39,740
community can get involved with your

00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:42,110
work over at San Prince I think for us

00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:44,270
there are two ways one we are always

00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:46,090
looking for volunteers to help us with

00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:49,700
integrations there are a lot of

00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:51,860
open-source platforms out there and we

00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,450
are building integrations with many of

00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,940
them but there's still some left

00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:58,250
particularly some tools that are used

00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,450
for the kovat response so we are

00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,190
currently working with the range of

00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:04,309
volunteers that help us with integration

00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:06,110
so if you are an Android developer in

00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:07,640
particular would love to hear from you

00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:10,070
and please get in touch directly with me

00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,440
and the second one is around open source

00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:15,289
and brainstorming if you have any ideas

00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,840
around how do we open source a

00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:19,970
technology that's as sensitive as ours

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,270
again please get in touch with me and

00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:26,149
I'd love to have a conversation awesome

00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:27,590
great thanks so for Clayton and Linda

00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:29,149
another question that I know a lot of

00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:30,710
our audience members want to know is

00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:32,270
what are some of the things that are

00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:33,770
working really well in the open source

00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:35,720
for good space when it comes to coping

00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:37,149
19 pandemic responses and what are some

00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:42,049
things that we should be improving

00:26:37,149 --> 00:26:43,880
Clayton yeah that's a great question and

00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:45,169
I think we mentioned a little bit in the

00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,720
talk what I think that's working really

00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:48,740
well is seeing tools that have existing

00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,510
footprints we're using that

00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,799
infrastructure you know you mentioned

00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:53,690
DHS two a couple times at the talk I

00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:55,700
mean definitely countries where their

00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:57,649
existing installations of DHS 2 and

00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,970
they're reusing it and using the modules

00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,860
that they're being distributed from that

00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:02,120
team we're seeing a lot of traction

00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,799
there in terms of teams that are moving

00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,630
really quickly and responding to the

00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:06,620
virus you know immediately which is what

00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,630
we love to see out of the gate

00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,730
unfortunately something I'm also seeing

00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:13,520
is a lot of teams who are kind of

00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:15,590
jumping in to Coba 19 response who kind

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,630
of don't have any history of success of

00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:19,640
scale and missing just a big the gap is

00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:21,200
between an MVP and mission-critical in

00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,610
this context you know especially people

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,600
who are kind of coming in with who don't

00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:25,010
have that background in public health

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,750
and don't know hard that can be and I

00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:29,120
think in our in our discipline there's a

00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:30,529
lot of not invented here syndrome you

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,460
know people jump into digital developer

00:27:30,529 --> 00:27:33,200
for the first time

00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:34,580
and they they think they can build tools

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,620
that kind of feel more mature to a

00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,390
Western high tech developer and kind of

00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:40,340
ignore the last 15 20 years of lessons

00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,690
that would have gone into the field so I

00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,590
think that's something that we could use

00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,419
a lot more help with is just

00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:45,860
coordinating how we can get people

00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:48,440
involved and upskill them and give them

00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,970
that context yeah absolutely I think

00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,500
it's something that's something that I

00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,750
can relate to as a UX designer who's

00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,980
primarily worked for the UI you can make

00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,419
it really pretty UI you can make

00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:58,190
something that's so amazingly

00:27:56,419 --> 00:28:00,260
appropriate for the United States and

00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:01,700
then try to deploy it and sub-saharan

00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:03,799
Africa and you'll get a bunch of like

00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,120
stairs I think it was an important

00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:06,620
lesson learned so both build off of

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,830
what's already there and make sure your

00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:11,480
context appropriate and on that note so

00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:13,010
Linda you run something called tech

00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,929
salon I've had the privilege of coming

00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:16,250
to many over the years would you like to

00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:18,380
give us some background on your tech

00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:20,299
slots and how you're kind of delving

00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:24,020
more deeply into digital tech and kovin

00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:25,880
responses yeah I'll be great so we you

00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:27,830
know we used to do tech salons in person

00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,179
face to face sort of small conversations

00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:31,309
that we had in the same room we didn't

00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:33,230
use tech for the tech salon because we

00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:34,760
wanted a real honest open conversation I

00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:38,179
was kind of off the record but we've

00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:40,130
since moved to digital and so we've been

00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:41,840
running them you know on digital

00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:43,429
platforms and getting a lot more people

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,200
in the room and we've been focusing the

00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:47,600
recent ones really on the tech sector so

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,460
the first salon was about you know I

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,230
pulled a lot of the lessons for my talk

00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,490
today from the first alone we listen to

00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,380
a bunch of folks that had been working

00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:55,580
in the Ebola crisis and they kind of

00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,010
brought together their direct experience

00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:00,049
to their research what were the tech

00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:02,659
tools that workmen didn't work in the

00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:04,970
Ebola crisis we did one after that

00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:06,950
around how communities refugee

00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,510
communities are adapting and using and

00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:10,130
what they need in terms of technology

00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:12,049
and what local organizations are facing

00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:14,360
in terms of tech challenges then we did

00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:15,740
one last week or a data privacy and

00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,720
ethics and the one that's coming up

00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:20,029
which is going to feature our host Amala

00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,590
here is gonna be around exactly that

00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:23,600
topic of how can you volunteer your time

00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:26,000
and your skills during the chloe crisis

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,470
so if you jump over I put it in the

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,649
discussion but if you jump over to tech

00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:32,330
