	Let’s face it, the future of software is where you can accomplish your tasks wherever you want and however you prefer to work. Accordingly, GitHub has expanded its toolset to provide you new experiences this year via GitHub Mobile and GitHub CLI Beta and improved experiences via GitHub Desktop. These three products represent the extended GitHub experience to provide you the right tools to be productive with your work at your fingertips. You deserve nothing less.

In this talk, we’ll take a deeper dive into typical Git and GitHub workflows like pushing your code and opening a pull request, reviewing code, and switching contexts and how you can increase your productivity by leveraging GitHub Mobile, CLI Beta, and Desktop.
