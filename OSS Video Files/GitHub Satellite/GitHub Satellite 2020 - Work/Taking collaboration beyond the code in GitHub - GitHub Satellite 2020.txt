we have to but you know just tell Jackie

00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:49,410

live virtual only event so thank you to

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,659
all our sponsors have been absolutely

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,049
amazing providing help and resources to

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:13,770
get this off the ground so but century

00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:15,869
circle CI insta bug Pony code Microsoft

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,460
Azure a new current now these people

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,920
have been and companies have been

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,680
absolutely amazing offering their

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,880
support and resources but they have

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,680
given money but the money is not for us

00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:32,340
Jared no tell us where all the money is

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,140
going it's not coming to me Steph it's

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,640
not going to you it's not going in that

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,430
it's not going to Satya

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,150
every single dollar goes towards the

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,740
kovat 19 relief effort but there's more

00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:45,930
for every dollar that's been contributed

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,720
by our sponsors github is matching that

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,490
so I mean it's I'm pretty proud of I've

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,810
always been proud to work for github but

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,759
the fact that all of the money is going

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,250
towards helping the cove in 19 relief

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,200
effort I mean it's um it's a very proud

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,710
day for me I'm feeling pretty excited to

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,509
work here how about you I just I love

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,600
they ever wire for company that not only

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:08,550
cares about its employees like we got

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,860
lots of what we get which is nice but

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,440
they care about the communities they're

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,630
part of right and I think is yes

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,480
it is so amazing to work for a company

00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,400
like that and I just feel so incredibly

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,640
proud to work them and I thank them so

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,530
much for like all the sponsors as well

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,780
as github for providing all that money

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,250
to go to the Kogan 19 relief but we know

00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,140
it's such a crazy time for everyone

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,970
around the world you know all of your

00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,340
tuning in here everyone's in different

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:37,170
situation and we're just so thankful

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,150
that we could be here and put this on

00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:44,490
and to provide the money to people who

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:48,300
need it I love it we got some more

00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:50,040
people but we've got more people hit us

00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,690
with the next speaker I know you're

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:57,120
excited about this Ansari

00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:59,490
thank you so very much this is one of my

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,680
favorite people so she is a world

00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:03,540
traveler traveler and also focuses on

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,640
helping developers collaborate as a

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,320
community on github she's a senior

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,140
product manager here at github and the

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,230
name of her talk is taking collaboration

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:15,570
beyond the code and get up please help

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,930
me welcome the wonderful Becca's an

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,930
stained

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,560
hello everyone and thanks for taking the

00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,600
time to join my session this evening

00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,130
it's a little bit late here might be

00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,110
where you are but thanks again for

00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,270
taking the time to join me so this

00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:40,080
session tonight is going to be about how

00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:42,790
you can take collaboration beyond code

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,850
but Before we jump right in

00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,770
hello I'm Becca and I'm on the product

00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,900
management team here at github leading

00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,460
the discussions feature so I'm not sure

00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,590
if you watched the keynote from earlier

00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,300
today it's a pay if you didn't but not

00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,220
and I did announce a really awesome new

00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,570
feature that I'm super excited about and

00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,320
we're gonna cover a little bit in

00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,900
tonight's session

00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,330
it's called discussions by the way I'm

00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,610
super excited to be working on a product

00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:08,860
that helps communities connect and grow

00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:11,709
while working with communities on this

00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,570
feature the entire time I've learned so

00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:15,760
much about how unique these communities

00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:17,049
truly are and I'm excited to really be

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,830
bringing a lot of those learnings back

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:19,359
to you tonight

00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,100
all right so how about we get this

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,020
started and talk about community and

00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,660
collaboration which is really what us

00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,280
but what is at the core of discussions

00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,669
and what it means to build a community

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,590
on github so in tonight's session we're

00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:34,720
gonna cover a lot around collaboration

00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,210
and community and I want you to know

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,190
that you can take away a few things some

00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,169
examples of how you can start grow and

00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:43,000
sustain your communities on github as

00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:45,070
well as getting a little bit of an

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,970
inside glimpse into discussions being

00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:50,940
used today in communities github is an

00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,560
interconnected community of developers

00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,540
specifically yura does at its core and

00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,310
what I'd like to do for the next few

00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,590
minutes here is to take you into the

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,230
future of what another similar

00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,669
interconnected community looks like so

00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,830
we can apply some of those learnings

00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:09,400
back into how we can build communities

00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:11,260
on github now when I think of an

00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,600
interconnected community at scale I

00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:16,150
think of github and Star Trek I know

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,950
it's pretty nerdy it might be a little

00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,950
bit weedy but just bear with me for a

00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:23,950
second please they both have so much in

00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,660
common as both are similar or both of

00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:27,700
them both of these communities use

00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,100
similar products collaboration

00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,110
principles communication patterns and

00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:35,289
honestly they have a shared an affinity

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:37,749
with security and data but before I

00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:39,969
go a little bit deeper into my affinity

00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:42,279
for Star Trek I realized that not

00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:44,649
everyone on this session tonight might

00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:46,059
know what Star Trek is and not

00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:48,399
everyone's spending their evenings

00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:50,349
watching all eight seasons of Star Trek

00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:53,319
next generation for the fifth or

00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:54,669
honestly eighth time at least for me for

00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,909
those who don't know much about Star

00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:56,589
Trek

00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:59,169
it's an American science fiction show

00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:01,059
and the main crew sets aboard the USS

00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:03,669
Enterprise and their mission is to

00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:06,219
explore strange new worlds seek out new

00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:08,199
life new civilizations and of course to

00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:10,389
go boldly where no one else has gone

00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:14,020
before so naturally I couldn't help but

00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:15,849
think of github first of all both of

00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,459
these communities have humanoids with

00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:20,770
incredible abilities on github

00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:23,529
maintained errs have created accessible

00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:25,809
and inclusive spaces to inspire creative

00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:27,699
coding for artists for example building

00:06:25,809 --> 00:06:30,099
lightweight and extendable data grids

00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:31,629
ferg react and building bots for

00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:33,939
automation for some of the most

00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:37,029
high-value tasks that no one should be

00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:39,939
doing manually ever again in Star Trek

00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:41,949
well we have more than humanoids there

00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:44,199
with great abilities and while it's true

00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:46,839
that the folks in Star Trek are doing

00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,249
amazing feats with code I'm not entirely

00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,689
convinced that they make it as

00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:52,689
accessible as the maintainer is on

00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:54,879
github the barrier to entry on Star Trek

00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:56,289
is a bit high I mean they do have to go

00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:58,719
to school for it after all and

00:06:56,289 --> 00:07:00,580
maintainer is on github do a phenomenal

00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:04,180
job making sure to lower that barrier

00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:07,029
where possible thanks to the help of

00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,009
bots automation and even actions it's

00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:12,189
possible to extend the growth in your

00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:14,469
community whether that's on github or on

00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:16,569
the Star Trek Enterprise I can say for

00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:18,819
sure that BOTS and some level of

00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:20,919
automation alleviates a lot of the

00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:24,369
manual work that people would rather not

00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:26,769
be doing and when you have so many

00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:28,389
humans in a community collaborating I

00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:30,819
have to say that with the upcoming

00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:32,709
release of code spaces alone we have a

00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:34,479
lot more in common with Star Trek and

00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:38,349
the ways that we can easily interface

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,969
with code just like Star Trek were in a

00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:42,129
remote first culture right now and

00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:44,949
that's at the core of what github is and

00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:48,169
what github enables but Star Trek might

00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:50,479
have been leaving the path here and

00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:53,419
from code scanning depend about security

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,490
advisories and so much more I think it's

00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:57,620
fair to say that our suite of security

00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,840
products stack up to the strength and

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,479
coverage from the security team on the

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:06,560
US on USS Enterprise vessel namely Worf

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:08,779
and how could I not talk about data both

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,029
github and Star Trek are great examples

00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:13,669
of communities that have built amazing

00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:15,229
features with the troves of data that

00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:19,430
one can access and build on top of

00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:22,189
securely so whether it's 50 million

00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:24,469
developers or an interstellar collection

00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:26,539
of more than a hundred and fifty planets

00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:28,819
both have one thing in common at its

00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,919
core it's an interconnected community

00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:33,199
now Star Trek wouldn't have an

00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:34,760
interstellar community if it didn't have

00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:37,459
a strong sense of community and

00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,889
collaboration while this is obvious to

00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:42,260
the super fans of Star Trek which might

00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:43,909
be many I know it isn't as obvious how

00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:47,089
you might apply this to your community

00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:49,010
on github today it's important that we

00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:51,500
define what collaboration and community

00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:53,750
mean both in the context of this analogy

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,930
as well as github developer community

00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:59,300
both community and collaboration

00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:00,980
requires more than one person and having

00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,920
a community means that there's a shared

00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,240
goal or purpose and collaborating

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,790
implies that there's level of

00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:11,180
participation and ideally cooperation

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:13,399
occurring within the community while

00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,470
communities on github have code at its

00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,209
epicenter the people within the

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,970
community are what keep your code

00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:21,920
thriving and improving and there is so

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:24,079
much more to a project than hacking away

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,839
at an endless issue list and merging

00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:28,699
pr's there's so many conversations that

00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,980
are happening in your community whether

00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:33,079
that's prioritizing issues keeping

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,390
projects up to date dragging and

00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:37,730
dropping cards or even updating your

00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,319
documentation and all of this is while

00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,060
you're still planning for the future

00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:44,899
needs of your product and the people

00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:47,060
that it serves ok so now that we've

00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:48,920
created a little bit of a more detailed

00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,019
framing around what communities and

00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,569
collaboration could look like both on

00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:55,069
github and in some alternate reality of

00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:57,529
science fiction that I really need to

00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:59,269
let go of I know I get it let's talk

00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:01,850
about what it really means to start grow

00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:03,529
and sustain communities on github

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,839
as well as some really really awesome

00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:08,180
examples that so many communities are

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,819
using right now to help them meet their

00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,920
community's needs

00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:14,750
so to start a community there's a lot

00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,819
that you need to do and to be aware of

00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:19,009
but thankfully there's tons of great

00:10:16,819 --> 00:10:21,620
examples and documentation for how you

00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:23,000
could get started there's two things

00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,399
that are worth noting though before we

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,130
get started on this on this phase number

00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:30,110
one no assumptions are safe so you need

00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:32,149
to spell things out clearly even if you

00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:34,790
think that it's super obvious to you and

00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:36,920
number two just don't get attached to

00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,839
whatever you start because it's bound to

00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:42,889
change as your community will over time

00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:46,009
as well every community has its own

00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:49,009
checklist this checklist is not by any

00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:51,019
means a full list of requirements and at

00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:53,000
the end of the day no list should be

00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:55,550
viewed as yet another checklist

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,930
since building a community is more than

00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:59,690
building sorry

00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:02,269
building a community is more than just

00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:04,639
ticking a box take the code of conduct

00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:07,730
for example checking one into your

00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,930
repository is only the first step but

00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,389
making sure that you have the right

00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:13,730
escalation paths and potentially another

00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:16,339
person who could be more objective and

00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:18,439
isn't sitting so close to the code is a

00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:20,870
great way to bring intention ality and

00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:24,560
safety into your community space on

00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:26,630
github but welcoming newcomers is such a

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,430
seemingly small task and it's a

00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:31,370
meaningful part of starting a community

00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:33,230
let's take electrons for example they

00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,600
use a bot to welcome newcomers when

00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:38,120
their first issue is opened this allows

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,709
them to welcome the newcomer allow them

00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,389
to remind them of exactly what the

00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:44,269
guidelines are and tell them how to

00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:46,490
contribute into the community electron

00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:48,740
also has an example of an onboarding

00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:50,600
guide and so this repository allows all

00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,240
newcomers to have a really easy place to

00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,980
go and get learning resources for

00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,500
getting more familiar with the electron

00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,790
codebase and its dependencies great

00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,589
examples of how you might want to

00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:04,009
consider welcoming newcomers into your

00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:05,329
community another way to make sure that

00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:07,490
you can set up your community for

00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:09,170
success on github is to make sure that

00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:12,139
your community always knows where to go

00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:14,449
for support no js' does this by having a

00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:14,990
really clear list of table of contents

00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:17,060
in there

00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:18,380
me so folks can quickly dive into

00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,720
sections that they need more information

00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:23,570
on specifically where to go if they need

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,550
help no js' also has a collection of

00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,470
resources on their website so that

00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:31,670
people who want to get involved beyond

00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:33,950
the code can do that the processing

00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:36,260
foundation which powers the p5.js

00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:38,630
project for example is one of my most

00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,250
favorite examples for a community that

00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,959
is specifically built to welcome

00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,850
newcomers and be more accessible and

00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:47,480
inclusive as well as inspiring

00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:49,850
creativity with coding the p5.js project

00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,970
has a section in their readme dedicated

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:55,490
exclusively to learning resources which

00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,860
includes an absolutely magical trove of

00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:00,050
tutorials from dan Schiffman called the

00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,580
coding train they're great and you

00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,260
should definitely definitely check it

00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:06,680
out after this if you if you have the

00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:08,930
time for newcomers specifically looking

00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,270
to contribute to your project good first

00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:13,940
issues is a really great way to enabling

00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:16,070
newcomers to easily find issues that you

00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:19,940
have deemed suitable for a first-time

00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:22,220
contributor on a project and by using

00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,380
the good first issue label you're not

00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,420
only welcoming newcomers into your

00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,010
project but you're opening the door for

00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,470
so many more and we're gonna go through

00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:32,810
a few examples of how that's the case so

00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:34,310
first of all there's a contribute view

00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:36,620
that a lot of people don't know about

00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:38,570
and I know this exact example was shared

00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:41,209
earlier today on twitter by the nodejs

00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:42,860
community too so I'm super excited that

00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:44,779
a lot of people are finding out about it

00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,089
but this contribute view is something

00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:49,100
that you all you're able to see here are

00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:50,690
good first issues and it's right next to

00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,630
the contributing guidelines which is

00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:55,339
really great and welcoming for newcomers

00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:57,920
second when you use the good first issue

00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:59,930
label you make it easy for others who

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,640
are not yet familiar with your project

00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:03,649
to find those issues when they're

00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,600
browsing the topics associated with your

00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:07,670
repository so if you're also not using

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,060
topics associated with your repository

00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:12,920
I'd highly recommend going to do that

00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:15,529
last but certainly not least for those

00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,779
who use github comm slash Explorer they

00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:20,779
will now see recommendations for good

00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:22,160
first issues soap so consider using it

00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:23,860
because more people who use that feed

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,089
will have those personalized

00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,650
recommendations on github.com slash

00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:31,110
explore moving forward

00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:33,300
something else that the nodejs community

00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:36,000
does to welcome newcomers and set them

00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:38,700
up for success is providing a mentor for

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,010
select issues these issues are not as

00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,620
common but when they are opened there's

00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:45,360
a mentor available like Anna here who

00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,760
helps the potential assignee walk

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,760
through their approach and reviews open

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,310
pull requests this process for allowing

00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,320
a mentor to be available allows Anna and

00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:57,450
the node community to onboard the

00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:01,110
contributor into the community firsthand

00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:03,480
as a result the contributor can ideally

00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:05,310
grasp the inner workings of how node

00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,900
works and how how the community

00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:10,710
communicates and works as a

00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:12,330
collaborative group now we're ready to

00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,800
go through the growth stage and what

00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,510
that might look like for your community

00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,610
as it continues to expand and change

00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:20,250
over time each of these steps in the

00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,990
process is super critical both the start

00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,600
growing which is where we're at right

00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:26,520
now and sustaining but I'll admit I'm

00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,780
particularly jazzed about this since

00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:31,020
we'll cover a few examples of

00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:33,360
discussions as mentioned in the keynote

00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,790
earlier discussions is a new space for

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,980
your community to connect while issues

00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,960
were previously being used for questions

00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,820
and conversations we know that doesn't

00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:45,030
scale when it's your to-do list and

00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:47,370
being bombarded conversations that are

00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:50,430
super valuable and they deserve a space

00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:53,010
of their own newcomers need a safe space

00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:54,930
to ask questions and community members

00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:57,120
also want a way to share their work and

00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:59,490
recognize what others have done to help

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,100
them out maintainer x' also need a way

00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:04,950
to announce changes receive feedback and

00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:07,080
discuss upcoming releases all of this

00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:10,770
and more will be possible to do in the

00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:12,660
discussion space as we've been iterating

00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,190
on discussions the past few months it's

00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,560
been really great to see how different

00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:19,050
communities are using it take

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,000
imagemagick for example discussions is

00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,920
being used as a way for the core

00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,080
maintainer group to be more connected to

00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,210
their user base so it can be more or

00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,870
less of a feedback loop from consumers

00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:32,970
to maintained errs using that project on

00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:35,130
the other hand ver sell in the next Jake

00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:36,900
s community have been guiding a lot of

00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:39,120
their community support needs into

00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:41,490
discussions so that answers are more

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,120
easily discoverable for other community

00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,370
members

00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,529
aren't aren't being in more of a femoral

00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,600
location where they were being lost and

00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:52,440
gone over over and over again by the

00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:55,320
same people all of that is to say that

00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,330
in order to grow your community we know

00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,160
that you will need lots of tools to do

00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:01,380
this and you the needs for your

00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,779
community might not work for another

00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,970
as we continue iterating on this

00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:08,189
discussions product we plan to build the

00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:10,350
future with this in mind so that you

00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:12,270
will be able to configure the space for

00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:16,319
your community in the way that works

00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:17,939
best for your community's needs so from

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,520
being able to have the right resources

00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:23,400
and announcements that are super visible

00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,230
for newcomers to having categories fit

00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,449
the types of conversations you want your

00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,160
community be having or even the ones

00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:31,170
that your community is already having

00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:35,130
all of this will be possible with

00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:37,920
discussions so last but certainly not

00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:40,440
least sustaining a community requires a

00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,750
team and all of their efforts should be

00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,470
recognized rewarded and perhaps

00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:48,600
automated where necessary

00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:50,670
speaking of automation there are tasks

00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,260
that should be automated where possible

00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,660
especially when those tasks are

00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,910
repetitive in nature and while there is

00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,350
the potentially obvious automation

00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,720
examples that I can give you around

00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:03,030
celebrating first pr's being merged I'd

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,570
like to cover some other examples for

00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:08,010
super high value tasks that communities

00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:10,050
have been using to make sure that

00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:13,230
they're collaborating more effectively

00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:15,360
as a team these two examples are for

00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,010
BOTS called trap and roller which help

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,840
the contributors be more efficient with

00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:21,570
their tasks specifically for back

00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,550
porting and updating dependencies so a

00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:27,120
ruler for example automates the process

00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:30,300
of updating the dependencies an electron

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,220
namely chromium in node while trap helps

00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:36,900
automate the process of back porting

00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:39,059
features and bug fixes and to sustain a

00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,070
community growth all of the

00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:43,590
contributions within the community need

00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:45,900
to be recognized so thanks to the all

00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:48,290
contributors bot it's possible to create

00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:51,210
a way to publicly recognize and reward

00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:53,850
contributions that go beyond code the

00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:55,950
p5.js project has done this to recognize

00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:57,779
the work that all contributors do

00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:59,880
outside of issues and pull requests

00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:02,909
because there really is so much work

00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,590
that community members are doing to get

00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:07,950
all of that work done on github today

00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:09,720
within a project and discussions are

00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,370
just the start of extending the

00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,500
contribution graph in a way that's more

00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:15,510
representative lowers the barrier to

00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,519
entry for newcomers and elevates the

00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,559
value of work for so many folks and

00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,299
communities that they're doing right now

00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:25,350
that we need to be recognizing more

00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:28,409
publicly so we went through a bit today

00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:30,000
or tonight here and so to recap I want

00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:30,990
to go through exactly what all of the

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,059
examples are that you should be

00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:34,919
considering for starting growing and

00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:36,659
sustaining your communities so for

00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:38,460
starting a community there's a few

00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:40,260
things that you want to be doing or you

00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,870
should at least be considering from

00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,970
using bots to welcome newcomers

00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:46,590
reminding them of your guidelines

00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:48,389
considering using good first issues and

00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:51,179
making those more visible to other

00:19:48,389 --> 00:19:53,070
projects and even considering mentorship

00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:56,279
SIF that's something that you feel your

00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:58,320
community could utilize instead of

00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:00,990
giving them just a good first issue and

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,820
with the use of discussions growing your

00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:05,190
community and what they can more easily

00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,720
access and be a part of as possible

00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,820
so again if you're curious about

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,399
discussions let me know and we're also

00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,710
excited to be showing you that later

00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:16,049
this summer for your open source

00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:18,330
communities and last but not least to

00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:20,279
sustain community growth consider using

00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:22,049
automation that's already available to

00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:23,850
you so many communities have made these

00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:25,470
available and you should consider

00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:26,880
checking them out here all of those

00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:30,299
projects were listed on the right hand

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,710
side so yeah for all the communities

00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:34,139
that I've referenced in today's talk

00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:36,240
they can be visited on github to see how

00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:41,549
they have personally grown their

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:44,070
communities on github to date and with

00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:45,630
that I'd like to invite you to ask us

00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:48,179
any questions that you might have in our

00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:49,850
discussion we're super excited to have

00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:52,919
more updates coming this summer on

00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:54,450
discussions the product and with that

00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,080
I'd like to hear what questions you

00:20:54,450 --> 00:21:00,269
might have

00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:03,950
thanks for coming tonight thank you so

00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:07,740
much that wonderful presentation I got i

00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:09,299
loving the Star Trek references my slack

00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,179
was actually going out with

00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:14,460
beca's Star Trek references and is is go

00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:30,779
Jared what have you got on your head

00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:32,909
he's a man about creating community and

00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:35,970
good charity guidelines not putting octa

00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:39,649
cats on your head okay so whatever

00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:41,970
change how we build communities this

00:21:39,649 --> 00:21:43,590
community maybe we should all just grab

00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:45,570
off the captain put on our heads and

00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:50,759
that's gonna be like a new community

00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:53,190
thing coming it's a zero second

00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:55,200
satellite appearance and we know that

00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:57,659
you've got had discussions announced

00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,460
this morning and they're just we're

00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:00,989
already been using them all day which i

00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,639
think is really saying that we can

00:22:00,989 --> 00:22:05,039
announce something and then have

00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:06,809
everyone go and use it for the thing

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,190
that you announced it at which is really

00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:10,320
good I know we've got lots of questions

00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:12,269
coming from the discussion so Jared

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,059
Heroes with some of those questions

00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:17,429
coming from discussions about

00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:19,409
discussions and about community I would

00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:21,989
love to and first off Becca I want to

00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:27,960
thank you for all of those amazing Star

00:22:21,989 --> 00:22:30,090
Trek references I grew up but it was

00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,720
amazing but your questions we got time

00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:35,609
for this thank you for this my mother

00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,940
grew up watching it see that she liked

00:22:35,609 --> 00:22:42,239
me like I ended up watching it the next

00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,739
generation from 1987 to 1994 you can

00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:45,570
fact check me that was when the series

00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:48,149
ran the fact that you're doing that like

00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,859
thank you it was amazing but enough of

00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:52,950
me Misha asked me to ask some questions

00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:55,379
I'm gonna make it so so first question

00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:57,509
have you been getting feedback from

00:22:55,379 --> 00:22:59,960
communities on discussions already and

00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:02,340
if so what does that look like

00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,499
great question yes we have been getting

00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:07,259
feedback for a few months now since we

00:23:04,499 --> 00:23:09,659
first launched as a limited beta with

00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:11,039
next day s and ever since then we've

00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:13,350
been onboarding communities we're

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,629
currently up to around 60 I believe I

00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:17,669
announced in the keynote today and the

00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:20,609
feedback has been super positive and

00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:22,200
super honest so we've definitely made a

00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:23,610
lot of changes if you've seen

00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,860
discussions

00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:28,019
two months ago versus what it looks like

00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,549
today it looks quite different and the

00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:31,620
features and functionality are changing

00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:35,179
as well and all of that is thanks to the

00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:37,970
feedback from our communities so yeah

00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:40,230
that's awesome

00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:42,090
using the discussions and I know it's

00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:45,630
very using discussions here today they

00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:47,549
have feedback where can I put that right

00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:49,889
now there's a feedback link if you're

00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:51,570
accessing discussions in any open source

00:23:49,889 --> 00:23:58,559
repository and that goes directly to us

00:23:51,570 --> 00:24:00,840
on the product team question yeah so the

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:03,870
next one is so obviously right now a lot

00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,730
of conversations and discussions have

00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:07,769
been happening on issues for four years

00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:10,409
on github so what if people want to take

00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:12,059
like how do look for those issues that

00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:14,190
are already created like what's the

00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:16,620
process to get them into discussions how

00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:18,539
do people do that that's such a great

00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,610
question Jared so there's two ways right

00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:22,559
now one if you only have a few or

00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:24,330
someone just keeps bypassing say your

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,860
templates and creating an issue where

00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:28,019
you don't want it on the right-hand

00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,909
sidebar as an admin or a maintainer you

00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:32,759
can convert that issue directly into a

00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:36,179
discussion but the really really cool

00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:38,340
part is that you can convert in bulk all

00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:40,559
of your issues into a discussion if it

00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:42,360
has a certain label so say you have all

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,669
of your issues with a labeled questions

00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,500
you can go ahead and convert all of

00:24:44,669 --> 00:25:10,259
those through the labels page to

00:24:46,500 --> 00:25:12,659
discussions right now at chevelle umba

00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:14,909
can we make discussions just replace

00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:18,750
slack or other group chat platforms or

00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:21,360
discussions on github repos I think

00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:23,580
that's a personal a personal option if

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,289
you want to if if that's your preference

00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,409
for your community and it works for you

00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:30,179
you're more than welcome to do that but

00:25:27,409 --> 00:25:31,980
to be honest every community uses

00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:34,590
tooling in a different way so I'm sure

00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,720
one communities usage of slack is quite

00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:37,309
different than another

00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,470
wouldn't be fair of me to say that

00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:44,030
anything is going to replace another

00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:55,210
tool completely it tastes like stopping

00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:57,980
crossed anytime soon it's so yeah yeah

00:25:55,210 --> 00:26:00,710
yard I know I can see them does what

00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:04,130
 I want to keep ask that ok I'm

00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:07,030
gonna do it alright at Mariano okey

00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:11,059
how does good first issue and Explorer

00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:12,890
work is it available already I would be

00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:17,960
really excited to use it as a

00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:20,240
combination with code spaces interesting

00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,400
drama I'm not sure of the integration

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,830
there with code spaces but yes to

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,559
github.com slash explorer already being

00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:29,690
available to all of our users on github

00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:32,150
calm and what it is is more of like a

00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:35,090
personalized feed so you can look based

00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:37,580
on topics collections or even just your

00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:38,990
own personal feed and so based on the

00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:41,090
types of contributions that you're

00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:43,010
making we can give you different

00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:45,620
suggestions for what you might want to

00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:47,360
consider looking at so if you're more of

00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:49,700
like a new contributor who's open to

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,559
different types of issues with select

00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,390
topics i highly recommend checking it

00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:55,429
out you might find new issues that you

00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:59,750
could take on in a new community that

00:26:55,429 --> 00:27:00,350
you weren't previously aware of it's

00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,120
awesome

00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:03,169
yeah I like it okay we're gonna move

00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,360
through because we got even more

00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:08,750
questions coming in all right from at

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:11,120
C&K is there an API endpoint that

00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:13,159
includes all contributions if this is

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:17,380
not publicly available yet would it be

00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:17,380
possible for us to get access to a beta

00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:24,440
so I think what they're asking is

00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:27,289
whether or not they can see all of their

00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:30,679
contributions which will go from issues

00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:33,169
PRS as well as discussions and so that

00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:35,030
is not yet available and we are looking

00:27:33,169 --> 00:27:37,760
at providing API endpoints for

00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:40,070
discussions and so we definitely would

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,570
have to think on that one a little bit

00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:43,280
more and understand what you're looking

00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:45,559
to do with it so that we can build it

00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,850
the right way so if you can provide more

00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:49,020
details and what you're hoping to do

00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:57,660
with it definitely let us back

00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:59,429
for the favor okay yeah I'm asking we

00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:02,580
had a couple people ask this but I'm

00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:05,910
gonna choose the first person at splack

00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:10,410
thar work in teams or organizations sign

00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:12,270
up for access to discussions so there is

00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:15,390
no waitlist right now since we're hoping

00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:16,170
to come out with a public beta later

00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:18,780
this summer

00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:20,010
so I'd say hold tight and hopefully you

00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,600
won't have to put your name on a

00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:23,610
waitlist because it will be available to

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,900
you shortly as long as you're in an

00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:29,130
open-source community that does

00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:33,720
collaboration absolutely that's all

00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:39,929
those communities do right right except

00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:42,390
you don't you're listening somebody's

00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:43,150
been listening I was listening to Star

00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:48,850
Trek

00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:48,850
[Laughter]

00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:57,480
okay

00:28:53,790 --> 00:29:01,980
tarek so 25 how does discussion differ

00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:04,740
from get up teams discussion it's a

00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:06,630
great question so github discussions is

00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,800
right where you exist right now with

00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:10,820
your code which is at the repository

00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:14,429
level the team discussions feature is

00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:17,400
not at the repository level it's based

00:29:14,429 --> 00:29:18,900
on the team structure so it's a little

00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,570
bit it's in a different location

00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:25,010
completely so it only teams can access

00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:26,840
that if you're using teams on github

00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:29,160
makes sense

00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:34,320
again I think do we have time for one

00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:38,450
more yes let's do one yeah you're gonna

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:41,910
do one more okay from J sake it

00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:45,600
will there be there's too many will

00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:47,250
there be it is for people that are open

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,160
for different types of projects in

00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:53,400
general rather just rather than just

00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:55,710
issues of a given project their

00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,120
beginning okay I see what they're asking

00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,740
let me repeat that will there be any

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,450
type of discussion space for people that

00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:02,550
are open for different types of projects

00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:06,930
in general rather just rather than

00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:10,230
issues of agat of a given project just

00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:13,950
like Scott that's what they're going yes

00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:16,260
so if if I'm interpreting the question

00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,700
correctly and again give me feedback in

00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,520
the discussion I'll be in there shortly

00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,800
if I'm getting this wrong it's going to

00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:25,890
be up to you how you use discussions so

00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:28,230
the examples that I showed you of the

00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:30,240
categories is something that we're

00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:32,700
hearing a lot of communities wanting to

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,950
use and already using but we don't

00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:37,050
expect that every single community will

00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:39,720
have discussions that necessarily fit

00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:42,180
into those categories so some are going

00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,700
to use it just for QA others are going

00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:46,710
to use it just for things and some

00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:49,770
prefer RFC's while others would never

00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:53,070
use a discussion for an RFC prefer a PR

00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:55,020
so it's really going to be up to you how

00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:56,340
to configure your community discussion

00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,530
space and we want to make sure that we

00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:01,890
give you the tools to to do that at the

00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:03,810
end of the day definitely well

00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:06,120
discussions is a new thing there's a

00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:09,120
lots of questions coming through becca

00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,860
is gonna be available on discussions but

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,900
next half an hour to answer all those

00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:14,610
questions and discussions so we'll stay

00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:17,070
over that thank you again so much backup

00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:18,900
for all your crazy Star Trek references

00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:22,430
and Topher knows all about discussions

00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:22,430
