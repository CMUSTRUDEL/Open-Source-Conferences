Playlist: GitHub Satellite 2020 - Work
Description: 
	Presented by Danese Cooper, VP Special Initiatives, NearForm

Innersource is the practice of proprietary companies adopting the modern massive peer-based software development engineering methods proven in thousands of FOSS projects over the past 20 years. Did you know that a booklet about innersource is the single most downloaded non-code asset on public GitHub? Since the rise of GitHub Enterprise, companies are increasingly experimenting with innersource inside their firewalls. Seems like a no-brainer, doesn't it? Most long-established companies need more collaboration and full-stack knowledge (and fewer information silos, resulting resource bottlenecks, "not-invented-here" re-inventions of the wheel, lack of innovation, and all the other un-necessarily wasteful proprietary practices that contribute to poor quality software and low engineering employee morale). Meanwhile, FOSS developers as a rule feel empowered to "scratch their own itches" and therefore suffer from few of these proprietary company woes. But as the FOSS movement has grown, there are cracks in sustainability starting to show in the form of maintainer burnout, lack of sufficient or appropriate corporate support for FOSS, and a real shortage of people willing and able to lead FOSS into the future. So how can innersource help FOSS Sustainability? Learn from someone who is thinking about how to grow the pool of qualified FOSS developers and to improve corporate support for FOSS basically since the term open source was coined. You'll hear about specific actions every developer and every company can take to improve software engineering, whether FOSS or proprietary, and help sustain the precious FOSS ecosystem through the next generation.

GitHub Satellite: A community connected by code

On May 6th, we threw a free virtual event featuring developers working together on the worldâ€™s software, announcements from the GitHub team, and inspiring performances by artists who code.

speaker so our next speaker was once a

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,449
privy Queen at Osan sphere and if you

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,510
don't know that means she was an

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:30,480
outhouse attendant but then worked as

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,120
the CTO of Wikipedia the chief open

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,250
source of and her son a senior director

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,079
of open source strategy for Intel and

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,660
another person that just means this

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,829
makes me feel like I need to work harder

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,750
because of everything yep a little bit

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,180
this a little bit she's the VP of

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,890
special initiatives at near forum and

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,020
the name of her talk is y inner force

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:55,050
and her source is a critical component

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:59,120
of FOSS sustainability please help me

00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,120
welcome the great Denise Cooper

00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:12,560
hi there hi there how you doing my name

00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:14,570
is Denise Cooper and I am the VP of

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,030
special initiatives for near forum and

00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,220
I'm gonna talk to you today about why I

00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,710
believe that inner source is going to be

00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:24,140
very critical to phos sustainability in

00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:26,300
the long term so there's my twitter

00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:30,290
handle if you are tweeting and let's get

00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:32,869
started first of all to level set this

00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:36,619
is tim o'reilly and he coined the term

00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:39,740
inner source in 2000 he was working for

00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:41,450
a company on the board that he helped

00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,119
fund the founding of it was called

00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,800
collabnet and it was founded by the one

00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:49,460
of the two people that started apache

00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:52,520
and they wanted to teach the apache way

00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:56,000
to companies proprietary companies

00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,680
inside the firewall to help them you

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,350
know get better outcomes from their

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,619
engineering and they did have some

00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:05,780
successes but in the long run in 2000

00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:07,820
Okin source hadn't been running long

00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,799
enough for people to believe that it was

00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,410
a better way to write software and so

00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:13,820
the company pivoted they still exist but

00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:18,680
they don't do a ton of inter source

00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:21,560
anymore but then we won about five years

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,600
ago I noticed that you know having been

00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,930
in in an open source since the beginning

00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,910
I noticed that people were not fighting

00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:32,180
us anymore everybody wanted to join us

00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:34,160
and and open source was the way that

00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,190
things were being built in fact if you

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,860
think of a company that is newer than

00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,480
Google faithful wouldn't exist without

00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,239
open source Google would not exist

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:48,079
without open source so that's great

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,989
right well looking at sustainability of

00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:53,480
open source I started wondering what we

00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:55,700
could do to increase the number of open

00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,010
source developers as maintainer fatigue

00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,739
started to creep in and so when I

00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,959
started working at PayPal it occurred to

00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:05,450
me that teaching them how to collaborate

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,930
in open source style inside the company

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:11,419
before we tried to build communications

00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,150
outside the company in communities was

00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:15,730
maybe a good strategy so in 2005 I

00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,700
started talking about it

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:22,030
I did it because I think something like

00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,950
85% of the world's engineers are still

00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:26,140
not working in an open-source way I

00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,420
think of that as they're in the salt

00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,819
mines because the way that we do

00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:34,030
open-source is so freeing for individual

00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:37,420
developers it's empowering it's it's

00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:39,459
educational you learn stuff you grow you

00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,530
can learn anything you want you can get

00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:43,930
facility and any part of our code base

00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,420
and it seems like that would be a good

00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,940
thing inside of companies as well so

00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:51,430
I've sort of dedicated the last five

00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,739
years and the next five years to getting

00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:56,170
inner source to be a household word and

00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:57,790
more and more companies to use it and

00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,370
you're gonna hear more about that in a

00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:03,069
minute these are some of the reasons why

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:05,200
companies engage in a nurse and I'll get

00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:07,900
to the open source bit in a second but

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,599
when you have over specialization in a

00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:13,599
company that's where just a few people

00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:15,640
know everything about a key piece of the

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,100
code but the rest of the company doesn't

00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:21,910
really know much about it that creates

00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:24,039
silos and that ownership culture can be

00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:27,099
a good choice at some point in a

00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:29,320
company's evolution but if you let it go

00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:31,810
for too long you start seeing technical

00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,150
debt pile up and that's you know denoted

00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:37,740
by the rust in this picture basically

00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:40,900
the silo starts becoming a liability and

00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,940
for many reasons because it's dangerous

00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,889
to have so few people know everything

00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,260
about a really important piece of code

00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:49,060
when nobody else knows everybody knows

00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,740
about a company where there's some piece

00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,900
of code that all the people that used to

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,430
maintain it have left and nobody knows

00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,710
what it does and they're all terrified

00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,870
to touch it so that can be really

00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:02,169
limiting as you're trying to grow or

00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:04,720
expand your services or to scale out so

00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:06,099
the number one real go after inner

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,370
source is because they're trying to

00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:11,560
reduce silos and the other reason

00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,210
besides the accretion of technical depth

00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,610
and silos are dangerous as they create

00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,560
bottlenecks it's not the only structure

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:20,080
that can do this and an engineering

00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,180
organization but if your resources are

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,190
not being fully utilized people are

00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,750
sitting around waiting for somebody else

00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,880
to get something done because they've

00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,289
made a feature request and nothing's

00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,659
changed yet

00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:34,210
especially if your if your executives

00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:36,399
are getting involved in escalating the

00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:39,520
priority of specific features or

00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:42,669
specific requests that you've got a

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,289
bottleneck problem so this is the number

00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:46,180
two reason it's the number one reason

00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:48,789
that PayPal started doing it however and

00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:52,509
there's a book about that that github

00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:56,080
has turned into the most important or

00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:57,669
popular non code asset on github it's

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,289
called getting started with inter source

00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:02,110
and you can go get a copy of it there

00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:05,199
it's 26 pages and it's all about a

00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:07,569
bottleneck story another reason that

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,879
people do inter source is because in

00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:11,860
their company they've over executed and

00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:14,409
everybody does the same thing and they

00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,959
do it perfectly which is great for

00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:18,879
maintaining the quality of something

00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,680
that you already know how to do but it's

00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:24,369
pretty limited in a figure out how to

00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:26,439
innovate and inner source has been used

00:06:24,369 --> 00:06:29,080
successfully by a major at least one

00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:30,279
major company to increase innovation and

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,860
I'm going to tell you more about that

00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:34,719
later and then quickly the last reason

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:38,019
that people resort to inter source

00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:40,629
inside of companies is because and this

00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:42,550
is just a fact of life as your company

00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:46,659
ages the people that you can hire to

00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:48,879
work are younger and younger and now we

00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:52,330
have a whole generation of digital

00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:55,059
natives who expect transparency they

00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:57,939
expect openness they expect agency and

00:06:55,059 --> 00:07:00,249
the way that traditional engineering is

00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:02,349
conducted is sort of solely facing to

00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:04,269
them which you might think isn't

00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:06,219
important but if if you've spent a lot

00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:08,080
of money selecting them and hiring them

00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:10,659
and training them to have them leave

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,729
sooner than you want them to is is not a

00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:15,159
good thing so there are companies who

00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:17,740
are trying to modernize or transform

00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:19,839
themselves agile was the first wave of

00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,379
this but we've seen successive waves and

00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:27,969
inner source is definitely one of them

00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:29,649
ok luckily there is github and of course

00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:33,999
this is gonna have satellite so thanks

00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:36,430
for the octocat guys but there are other

00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:38,199
tools you could use github is just the

00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,089
one that's most popular and most

00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,560
associated with inner source and they

00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:42,760
are starting to write features that are

00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,400
really supportive of the inner

00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,410
source experience unfortunately a lot of

00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,620
companies go get github Enterprise

00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:52,540
hoping to get inner source events to

00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,130
happen inside the company even if they

00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,250
don't have a name for that they want

00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:59,260
more code reused or they want you know

00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:01,840
cross company understanding of the code

00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:04,630
base or something but then when they get

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,090
it inside they those potentials

00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,800
by mirroring whatever permission

00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,200
structure was in their previous code

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,420
management system something like well at

00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,330
Westar those people must be excluded for

00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:18,070
a reason so just getting github

00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,950
enterprise and standing it up is not

00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:23,320
enough to get your culture to change and

00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:27,480
that's why there's room for people like

00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:30,520
me to talk about inter source to you so

00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:32,800
so this is the inner source logo as I

00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,560
say in 2015 I started talking about

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,110
inner source taking a big career risk

00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:40,240
frankly because open source advocates

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:43,750
were not into inner source at that point

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:47,140
because they want more open source code

00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:49,930
and to them it feels like detour but I

00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:51,310
realized in my consulting practice that

00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,650
most of the companies who were going to

00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:55,540
come to open source naturally had

00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,250
already done so now this doesn't count

00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,110
new companies but I'm talking about the

00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,880
existing companies and remember I'm

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:03,580
worried about that 85 percent that are

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,430
stuck in the salt mines so I thought

00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:09,820
that if we could you know use inner

00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:11,350
source as a not painless because it's

00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,310
definitely a trick to get it and

00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:17,380
implemented in your company well but to

00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,720
get companies started on their inner

00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:21,730
source journey inside the firewall so

00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,060
they're not risking brand embarrassment

00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:27,340
if they get it wrong and I posited that

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:30,370
that would lead to more not less open

00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:32,230
source and I think that's true so now

00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:34,090
we're to the question is inner source

00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:36,040
going to actually help vas

00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:39,070
sustainability is it really going to be

00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,270
you know hands across the ocean and I

00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:43,390
think so

00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:46,840
here's some evidence first of all today

00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:48,760
most open source developers work for a

00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:52,420
company that pays them to do open source

00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:54,580
now 20 years ago open source was mostly

00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,170
a hobbyist thing you did your day job

00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,620
and then you came home at night you

00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,840
worked

00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:00,670
your open source project that it's been

00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,440
a long time since that was true and I

00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:06,340
personally think that that's a really

00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:09,130
positive development for open source for

00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:13,000
instance Linux would not have triumphed

00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:15,340
over many other unix's if IBM had not

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,380
said look here's our logo right next to

00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:20,950
the penguin we're making a bet on this

00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:22,930
that was incredibly validating 18 years

00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,510
ago when they did it well maybe it was

00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:27,400
nineteen years ago when they did it and

00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,330
you know it made all the difference so I

00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,490
think it's a good thing that

00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,920
corporations are paying people to work

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:35,500
on open-source as long as they on that

00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,420
at the end of the day any reputation

00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,570
that's built around that project belongs

00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,580
to the individual developer not to the

00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:44,980
company it's a halo effect to the

00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,390
company because open-source is people

00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,570
and it's individual people because

00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:52,270
people change jobs right but I'm worried

00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:55,300
more about in the sustainability realm

00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:57,460
first of all how can we make sure that

00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:00,250
maintainer burnout which is a really big

00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:03,190
problem goes away how can we scale

00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:05,830
open-source not just more projects but

00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:08,130
more people working on the projects so I

00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:10,510
started thinking about the need to train

00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:12,960
younger and younger people to think

00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:15,100
about software development in an

00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,710
open-source way or an inner source way

00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:20,200
right now inner source open source are

00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:22,300
not really taught in universities much

00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,000
there are a couple of pioneering teams

00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:28,060
that do that but mostly it's still the

00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,920
old school way of doing development in

00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:34,210
fact it's hard to learn agile in an or

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:37,870
in a university now right so excuse me

00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:40,600
so if we want this to be taught in

00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:42,570
schools it we have to tip the balance of

00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,760
it being the way that at least most

00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:48,250
software development is done and the way

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,560
to do that is to get companies hooked on

00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,270
the benefits of inner source which are

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,240
many not just the four that I outlined

00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:56,890
there's a bunch of more and so that's

00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,920
one reason that I think it's going to be

00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:02,230
super good for open source because as

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,990
companies move to inner source they have

00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:06,940
to learn collaboration they have to be

00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,250
interested in that being taught so that

00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,570
the employees that they hire already

00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,090
know how to do it in our comfort

00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:15,130
with it and that pushes that age lower

00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:17,440
and lower that we start teaching how to

00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:19,420
do this stuff and you know really open

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,700
sources about all the votes rising in

00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:24,640
collaboration winning over competition

00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,710
it's still possible to compete but why

00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,970
compete on the horizontal stuff compete

00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:32,920
on the verticals right alright but also

00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:35,080
you know we have so many projects now

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,970
and so few experts that can actually

00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:40,020
maintain them as I keep saying we have

00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:42,880
real fatigue going on and I think that

00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:45,610
dipping into the existing pool of

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,470
engineers is the fastest way to get

00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,750
people who are willing to work on

00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:51,100
maintaining projects because you know

00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,290
they're battle tested they've been in

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,390
companies they know about the long haul

00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:57,610
and if you have successful software it's

00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:01,090
not all invent invent invent there's an

00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:03,010
awful lot of maintain maintain I think

00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:05,680
that the best place we can go to look

00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:09,360
for that that skill those maintainer is

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:12,040
in the existing pool of engineers so

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,050
eventually we end up having inner source

00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,430
and then more open source all over the

00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,260
world and I think that's what we all

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:19,120
want we want to see all these contents

00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,690
light up but we want enough people to

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,550
actually you know hold it all up right

00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:27,070
this is a list of companies that talk

00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:29,620
openly about their inner source journey

00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:31,540
and it represents a small percentage of

00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,910
the total companies that are involved in

00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:37,060
inner source and I know that because I

00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,530
talked to most of them these are there's

00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,690
people who are willing to be public so

00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:42,370
we can quote them but I want you to

00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,930
notice two companies in particular on

00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,330
this list I mean there's a pretty broad

00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:49,000
group here but look up in the corner

00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:51,880
there in the left is Microsoft and then

00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,310
Comcast right sort of kitty-corner to it

00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,890
those are surprising companies in my

00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:59,860
opinion to be on an inner source journey

00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:02,290
for different reasons but why they did

00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:05,530
it is sort of similar so both of those

00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:07,600
companies started with a little open

00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:09,550
source at the edges of the company and

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,680
this is a really common pattern people

00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:14,080
don't want to go all in on open source

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,000
they start out with just one project at

00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,340
the edge and those engineers have

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,320
special rights they're specially able to

00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,450
go do this work on this project right

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,880
well after they get a taste of that

00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,889
success

00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,720
they start wondering if those methods

00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:29,730
would make them more effective engineers

00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,290
inside the company and then they want to

00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,449
scale to the rest of the company and

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:35,819
that's what's happening at both Comcast

00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:39,509
and right now in Comcast's case they're

00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:41,430
doing it to get people ready to do good

00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:43,440
open source that exactly what I was

00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,420
talking about before they have to first

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,220
get collaboration going inside the

00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,380
company before they get to push it out

00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,060
to show that they know how to build

00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,920
community and to collaborate with people

00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:55,050
that aren't on their team and then

00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,149
Microsoft is an even more interesting

00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:59,550
case because you know famously they were

00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:02,850
the big enemy of open source for a long

00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:05,519
time but they have fixed that and now

00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,660
they want all the engineers of Microsoft

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,190
to learn how to work in this

00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,170
collaborative way and that's a sea

00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:12,089
change that's the kind of thing that

00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:14,490
will really build the number of people

00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:17,100
that are available to maintain projects

00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:19,889
so the reason I know those stories in

00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,930
depth is because I run a podcast through

00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:23,940
my company that is about inner source

00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,529
and what companies are doing with it and

00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,560
I'll tell you a little bit later how to

00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:31,319
get to that podcast this is a graphic

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:34,529
that Bosch built for itself that shows

00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:36,300
clot cross collaboration within their

00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:38,759
divisions so each of those little

00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:42,000
clusters is a division of the company

00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:43,740
and all of the cross connects in the

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,310
center our collaboration that are

00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:49,500
happening they spent years getting to

00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:51,000
this point of being able to show this

00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,949
graph of how collaboration was

00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,660
flourishing and that's because it's a

00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:57,120
really big company they have a lot of

00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,490
engineers but also they were all in this

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,550
lockstep and they had to gradually teach

00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:04,620
them that it's ok to do this to

00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:07,139
collaborate without you know sacrificing

00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,730
the velocity of the company so I love

00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:11,209
this graphic and I'm really grateful to

00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:13,829
Bosh for letting me use it

00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:16,680
this is inter source Commons which is

00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:19,139
your one-stop shop if you're interested

00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,810
in learning more about inter source this

00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:24,389
is a nonprofit or at least it we filed

00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:25,800
for a non-profit status that it's a

00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:28,230
community that's been together for about

00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,360
five years and like any open source

00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:32,130
community there's you know a 10x

00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,079
progression of people who are looking to

00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:36,029
people who are contributing to people

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,710
who are leading so you can meet the

00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:39,540
leaders of the inter source movement

00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,890
inner source common story you can find

00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,730
out about events that they're holding

00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:45,840
you can find assets like like PDF copies

00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,670
of all the books that have been written

00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,700
including that one I mentioned earlier

00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:52,680
and my latest book and and books that

00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,290
other people have written in an academic

00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,990
research all aggregated into one place

00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,850
you can find it and and then work that

00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:02,040
the community is doing to build training

00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:04,890
assets that are freely available and

00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,410
also patterns to identify patterns and

00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:09,480
all of this work is done with a lot of

00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:11,670
joy it's really a great community and

00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,589
you can join it for free by just asking

00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:15,660
for a slack account on this front page

00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:17,900
of inter source of common story so I

00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,910
hope you guys will go check that out and

00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:23,339
now we're coming to the end of my story

00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:25,350
about how inner source is going to help

00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:27,839
the open source movement that was

00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:30,780
absolutely my motivation for bringing it

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,640
to the fore again and I'm seeing you

00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,470
know not just those two companies I

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,160
mentioned but all over town I'm seeing

00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,990
open source come out of this so let's

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,660
join together in the beautiful new

00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:44,910
future that we're hoping for and thank

00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:48,090
you very much this is the URL to find

00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:49,740
those podcasts I think near form comm

00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:52,050
slash inner source might work as well

00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,910
but that one will definitely work my

00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,610
email address if you want to get a hold

00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:58,590
of me and thank you so much for this

00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:02,130
opportunity to talk about inner source

00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:05,310
and class today I really enjoy talking

00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:07,500
you know in normal space that's what a

00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:10,020
lot of my job and so to have virtual

00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,270
conferences of this kind of gravity show

00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:15,300
up and have people like me speak is

00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:17,640
really great so thanks very much and I

00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:21,380
think we might have time for some

00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:23,460
questions now thank you

00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:26,850
sorry much that wonderful presentation

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,380
taste I love all the talk about open

00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:30,120
source it's something they talk about a

00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,010
lot on the enterprise side on the sales

00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,410
side and I think it's a really good

00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:37,200
stepping stone to get into open source

00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:38,970
as well I just thank you so much that

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,090
presentation also for showing us the

00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:44,220
cool logo party and a logo in a source

00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:48,050
alesis is really going to tweeted it out

00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,050
yourself yes right thank you

00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:53,859
I love my things I want things yeah

00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:55,709
Jarrod you've got some questions that

00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:58,419
are going through the discussions for us

00:18:55,709 --> 00:19:00,009
we do an absolute honestly I want to

00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:01,539
thank you as well Denise you know I I

00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:03,249
don't have the the career that you have

00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:05,320
had yet but I do go and talk with

00:19:03,249 --> 00:19:07,419
enterprises about inter sourcing and you

00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,219
know the top topics I usually talk about

00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:11,619
are how you know open collaboration

00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:13,239
encourages more contributions you have

00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:15,309
developers that don't have to start from

00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:16,959
scratch on new projects and ultimately

00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:18,849
it strengthens the project but I think

00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:21,519
something I learned from you is it's a

00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:22,809
great recruiting tool as well and I

00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,899
think that's the thing I'm gonna add to

00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:26,889
my repertoire so thank you very much for

00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:29,139
that

00:19:26,889 --> 00:19:34,479
but another on that we've got questions

00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:38,289
on discussions coming in from at asel

00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:42,849
or at basil not sure is under source the

00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:47,619
panel I like basil is a nurse or a nurse

00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:50,649
or the path to open source well I think

00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:52,359
it can be at the very least it's going

00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:54,429
to clean up some of the problems in your

00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:57,519
engineering organization but my

00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:58,899
experience is that something like 75% of

00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,389
the companies that I have worked with

00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:03,669
and I'm trying very hard to touch most

00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:06,419
of them find that they are better

00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:09,489
equipped to deal with open source as a

00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:10,869
holistic thing not just a you know weird

00:20:09,489 --> 00:20:13,450
boutique thing that's happening on the

00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:16,899
edges of the company and that's super

00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:20,619
positive I think when you talk about

00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:23,079
being a quick dude well what you're kind

00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:25,179
of take on open source of inner source

00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:27,099
are in this sense being more of a

00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:29,200
cultural thing or just as much a

00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:33,129
cultural shift as it is a technological

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:35,589
shift oh it's definitely cultural shift

00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:37,809
it that if if it was easy for people to

00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:41,529
figure out how to do this they just do

00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:43,570
it but what we find is each individual

00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:46,389
company is not collaborating for a

00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:48,999
different reason so in some companies

00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:52,119
they've concentrated on hiring wizards

00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:53,799
or they've grown wizards and the wizards

00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:56,409
don't want to share their tricks that's

00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:57,070
really a common problem right in other

00:20:56,409 --> 00:20:59,259
companies

00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:01,570
everybody's matrixed into time

00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:03,190
management and they're all come there

00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:05,680
basically competing against each other

00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:07,420
inside the company for resources so

00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,400
their management won't let them share

00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,350
with other groups because that would be

00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,170
you know giving away points in the game

00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:16,570
somehow there's lots of different

00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:18,640
reasons why companies don't collaborate

00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:21,730
more but they're usually reasons that

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,800
also lead to bad habits and endemic

00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:26,980
problems that are hurting the company

00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,510
creating technical debt or or giving

00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,730
them liability because they just don't

00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:35,470
have good cross company knowledge about

00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:36,910
how things work right absolutely yeah

00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:40,180
that stuff it's it's a killer

00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:41,470
productivity you know and I think for a

00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,930
couple we have a couple more questions

00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:45,730
coming in here now and I think with

00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:47,380
companies that I stalk with a lot you

00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:49,510
know say when we're trying to promote

00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:51,100
inner source a lot of what they say is

00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,840
you know we don't we just don't do that

00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:56,140
here or we're scared of open source and

00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,430
I'm sure you've heard that yeah it's not

00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,830
a thing I'm sure you've heard that once

00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:01,450
or twice but I guess for a developer

00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,340
who's in a company like that like what

00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:06,390
would be your advice to them to try and

00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:08,860
promote inner source from the inside

00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:10,540
well you know there's lots of different

00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,570
ways to get open source off the ground

00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:14,890
and the last book that I wrote a year

00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,870
before last with somebody from

00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:18,940
University of Limerick class young Stoll

00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:21,480
who's a researcher right so it's sort of

00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:24,100
academic but also groovy kind of book

00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,480
it's a case study book and it talks

00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,280
about different companies that have

00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,260
gotten to inter source in different ways

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,050
and actually we're getting ready to do

00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:33,820
another edition of it because we found

00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:36,250
some more really good patterns and

00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,930
stories about how people get there but

00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:40,240
there are companies that get there from

00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:42,700
a single engineer literally a single

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,340
engineer saying wow why aren't we using

00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:47,620
the reusing code more why are we all

00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:51,220
writing the same code or solving the

00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:53,770
same problem based how is that better

00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:56,080
and you know if it's the right engineer

00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:57,910
they can lead a revolution from where

00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,230
they're sitting now eventually they're

00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,940
gonna need the support of senior

00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:04,330
management but they can get pretty far

00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:06,220
in showing the value that can be created

00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:09,460
by just by shifting to this other way of

00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,930
working just by doing it themselves you

00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,030
know solving their own problems first

00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:15,399
which open source is basically

00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:18,159
enlightened self-interest right we

00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:19,629
we wanted to be able to make changes so

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,429
that we could get our own work done

00:23:19,629 --> 00:23:23,649
faster rather than relying on other

00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:26,950
people to have time to do it it's a it's

00:23:23,649 --> 00:23:29,889
agency being you know manifest and in

00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:32,440
companies a lot of culture has beaten

00:23:29,889 --> 00:23:34,719
that out of the engineers and I think

00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,849
that's unfortunate because there's so

00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:39,279
much better if they have a little agency

00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:40,690
but it's also possible that senior

00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:43,929
management decides this is a good idea

00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:45,820
and you know usually The Groundlings are

00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:48,279
into it - it's usually middle management

00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:51,729
that's stuck on defending the existing

00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:54,159
castle at all costs but if you value

00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:56,669
that you can create you can completely

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,679
blow through that so there you go I

00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:01,029
really love that just later revolution

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,799
just like one-man band

00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:10,479
but Scarlett's like really the

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:12,759
revolution together lifes are recruiting

00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:15,609
sending out pamphlets I love it just the

00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:17,499
image of that is just so cool

00:24:15,609 --> 00:24:21,089
but I think we have John for one but

00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:24,460
more questions Jared what's coming -

00:24:21,089 --> 00:24:27,460
absolutely we have a question from tarik

00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:29,679
so 25 this person says we are pushing

00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,629
enter source for DevOps libraries it

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,999
tends to be a secondary job for our

00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:35,710
staff how do we convince management to

00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:37,960
fund or dedicate people to maintain

00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:44,469
inter source projects sounds like the

00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:46,359
revolution is one of the prime movers or

00:24:44,469 --> 00:24:47,979
inner source adoption right now because

00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:50,499
everybody has to do it from scratch

00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:52,899
there is no just add water and you have

00:24:50,499 --> 00:24:55,509
DevOps solution you have to fit it to

00:24:52,899 --> 00:24:57,969
your culture in your organization so you

00:24:55,509 --> 00:25:00,519
got a choice you can do all of it

00:24:57,969 --> 00:25:02,859
yourself every single team doing their

00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:04,989
own integration their own deployment

00:25:02,859 --> 00:25:07,269
characteristics or you can do it once

00:25:04,989 --> 00:25:09,909
for the company or you could do just the

00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:11,469
deployment once and then let everybody

00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:13,389
integrate there's lots of different ways

00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:15,489
to get there but it's an opportunity for

00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:18,729
code reuse that we don't see come

00:25:15,489 --> 00:25:20,679
through very often so yeah you for doing

00:25:18,729 --> 00:25:23,019

be able to demonstrate again the value

00:25:23,019 --> 00:25:27,460
