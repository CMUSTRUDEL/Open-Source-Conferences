Shen's awesome now we've got be Joey

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:15,000
he's back alright and thanks for the

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,690
introduction

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,520
I am super excited beginning this talk

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,140
but first time I talk about myself which

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,779
I am B dougie I am the developer

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,730
advocate here at github and I'm super

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:28,710
honored to be giving the last talk of

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,820
the night the evening the morning

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,040
depending on where you're sort of

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,260
listening from and it's sort of like

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,050
Beyonce closing out Coachella I'm just

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,399
gonna bring in the heat so I'm a

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,610
developer advocate I'm focused on

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,200
maintainer happiness and I just want to

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,730
go through and explain a couple of the

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,370
maintainer that I deal with on a regular

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,300
basis now this is is a representation of

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,809
maintainer

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,949
out in the wild and what I know from

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:54,360
maintainer is and my interaction with

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,190
maintainer is that they all have

00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,840
different life experiences a lot of

00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,940
backgrounds and a lot of reasons for

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,500
getting into open source software and

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,780
working on all these cool different

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,790
projects so whether they're or Oh plates

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,360
for react or if there are Python

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,650
libraries to drop some six be sick beats

00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,840
they all have their reasons to get in

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,409
the code but one thing I've learned from

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,909
my interactions is that they all have

00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:19,170
experiences where they start working on

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,549
things that are not writing code and

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,020
this talks are all going to be focused

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,290
on how to get you back to writing code

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,460
and being efficient as a developer I did

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,750
want to talk about real quick about one

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,990
of my friends max Tiber

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,130
he is a open-source maintainer and I

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,530
have a personal interaction with Tim

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,079
where he built a library which is to

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,450
react ball or a plate to solve a problem

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,490
that he needed to be solved at this time

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,560
it was my introduction to react and I

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,110
was looking for a project to support a

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,939
new project at my company and I needed a

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,860
way to get in to react really quickly so

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,479
I of course found the react boilerplate

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,070
and it sort of got the job done really

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,630
quickly I was efficient I was able to

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,700
ship a project in less than six weeks

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,890
without knowing any react before then

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,600
and funny enough I was able to learn

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,189
that story from this YouTube video that

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,469
how to open how open source changed

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,399
Max's life and highly recommend you

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:07,619
check that out

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,479
but the reason behind that was he was

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:12,000
looking for another way to be efficient

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,200
and react as well so I'm super happy

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,530
that he opens source down I'm super

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,360
happy

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,790
his career is sort of ballooned since

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,319
then but that's not the only thing we've

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,540
been doing so we we've been get up

00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,970
ourselves we've been shipping features

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,920
non-stop for as long as we've been

00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,390
around and the keynote not actually

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,239
mentioned that the pour requests

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,430
invented by github 12 years ago roughly

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,709
12 years ago and it came out of a need

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,550
to build more efficiency around code

00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:39,780
review and practices around get so

00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:42,020
github has not stopped shipping features

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:45,750
it's actually shown because we've grown

00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:47,190
to 50 million developers worldwide so

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,480
this could be terrible this could be a

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,160
terrifying number or super awesome

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,840
number but with this number I'm the

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,269
Advocate and one of the many advocates

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,370
at github that help support those 51

00:02:54,269 --> 00:03:02,580
developers are that support on our

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:04,980
platform so I also wanted to mention

00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,690
that bet 50 million developers we also

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,130
want to ensure that we had a home for

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,590
all developers and the way we do that is

00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:12,450
by shipping features now I know as a

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,819
github user you are very aware that get

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:16,980
husband shipping lots of features we've

00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,420
taken a lot of feedback we have a lot of

00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,310
feedback channels we have a really

00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,049
awesome support team and those

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,480
improvements around automatic automation

00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:26,190
collaboration community security of all

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,070
improvements just to improve your

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,390
developer workflows before I get really

00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,980
into the slides I want to talk about

00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:35,310
somebody who really knows about shipping

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,489
features and that's Beyonce now if you

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,650
aren't familiar Beyonce she is

00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:42,090
internationally known superstar which I

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,690
assume you should know her at this point

00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:48,260
and she got her started years ago

00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:51,480
describing and growing her career and

00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:53,820
exactly a week ago she shipped her

00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,500
latest feature which this is a remix of

00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,940
this average song now if you haven't I

00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,400
can actually play the song because of

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,320
copyright reasons but if you have not

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,090
heard the song please after this talk

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,600
after the actually after the party after

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,600
the end

00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,980
check it out on tik tok and then give

00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,640
the star goodbye like give a listen on

00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:13,950
on Spotify as well but I mentioned that

00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,350
because Beyonce was able to be efficient

00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,789
and ship that from her home as well so

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,739
keep in mind that were all sheltering in

00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:21,959
place beyond he's also sheltering in

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:24,360
place from our home Houston as well so

00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,580
with all that being said as a project

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,970
maintainer we want to make sure that we

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,040
have

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,630
of opportunity to make our jobs easier

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,760
like we want to know the tools we one of

00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:36,390
them the ways to sort of opt in to like

00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:39,480
the best experience so without that fall

00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:44,820
without further ado I would like for us

00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:47,160
to get into some features so this talk

00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:50,130
is a top 10 tips for project maintainer

00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:53,340
so let's go ahead and jump in first one

00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,950
is going to be scheduled reminders this

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,020
is a feature that is in it's been

00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:59,310
available for a little bit and a beta so

00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,260
how we recommend checking it off you do

00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:04,560
have access if not please request access

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,150
and this is self-evident I guess through

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,520
the name that you can actually set up a

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,930
reminder to tell you and your team when

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,030
there are four West ready for review I

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,430
always explain this feature with

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:16,530
whenever I ship code I - the first thing

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:19,110
I do when I were request is go directly

00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:21,360
to slack and paste that PR for everybody

00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,860
their review and then what happens as no

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,500
one looks at it and the next day on

00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,060
Tuesday I go back to the slack and ask

00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,410
everybody to look at my PR and then

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,850
Wednesday and then Thursday and then

00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,580
Friday I don't chip on Fridays because

00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:34,490
you know it's Friday so you don't have

00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,270
to go back in the slack all that time oh

00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,890
we're cutting we'll be over over and

00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,660
over again you can actually just go

00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,040
directly to your organize your team's

00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,770
dashboard and actually enable this

00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,060
feature today you can just provide your

00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,220
slack integration make sure you offer

00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,220
that and install the gap app and you

00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:54,330
have accident access to that multi-line

00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:56,190
suggested changes number nine now most

00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,890
people are aware of writing comments

00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,419
inline npr's but if you didn't know now

00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:03,090
you know you can actually highlight

00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:07,290
multiple lines of comments not only can

00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:10,260
you suggest code to be fixed but you can

00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:14,250
also accept that code directly inline as

00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:15,510
you can see right here so I am a bit bit

00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,610
of a stickler whenever I commit to a

00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:19,320
project I don't want to have to try to

00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,210
figure out how to clone look at a

00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,280
different branch and then get that code

00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:25,520
on my my system like we do have things

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,810
like code spaces which is in beta today

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,100
but before you get access to that you

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,890
could actually do this today and commit

00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,840
those changes directly number eight get

00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,729
affections and get up script so I was

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,729
actually part of a project back in March

00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:40,289
which was the github hackathon calm it

00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:42,719
was a it was an awesome hackathon

00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:45,360
was at hackathon we were supporting

00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:48,180
getting new actions into the ecosystem

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,879
we were also we built this this actual

00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,349
github hackathon on actions itself so

00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,119
meaning that we had a repo that

00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:55,589
supported the site that you're looking

00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:57,119
at right now and every time you

00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:58,830
submitted a new action we were actually

00:06:57,119 --> 00:07:00,089
running actions to validate the actions

00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,339
that you were shipping for the actions

00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:03,839
hackathon yes I know we use github to

00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,639
Bill github all the time and we were

00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,409
using actions to build this as well and

00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,050
this was the way we were doing our

00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:11,550
checks - we were validating with actions

00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,349
but then when we we needed to review

00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:15,869
different actions for whether or not

00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:17,490
they qualified the minimum requirements

00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:20,669
or it could be featured on the home page

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:23,550
we're using github script this is an

00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:26,129
example of a github script so here i've

00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:29,069
highlighted the code the the five lines

00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:30,270
of code to emerge of PR so if a PR

00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:32,879
itself that was submitted for the

00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:34,919
hackathon was good to go

00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,259
we need their label it good or will a

00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:38,550
bit label it feature just to note and do

00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:40,709
the automation to get that on the front

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,839
page so as of today if you scroll to the

00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:44,430
bottom github packet comm all those

00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:46,709
actions that are listed on there we're

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,979
powered by get of actions and built for

00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:51,959
github actions with github actions

00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:54,599
number seven getup sponsors and web

00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:57,050
hooks so very recently we shipped a lot

00:07:54,599 --> 00:08:01,729
of new features for sponsors including

00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:03,959
opening up for Mexico with web hooks and

00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:05,519
activity with the Activity Feed we

00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,899
actually have two projects that I want

00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,029
to talk about which one is a sponsor

00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:11,580
functions which are surplice functions

00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:14,009
that setup what web hooks and get people

00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,409
into your slack groups so imagine you

00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:17,729
want to create a web plug to notify

00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:19,559
whenever someone's a sponsored they join

00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:21,539
your discord join your slack you don't

00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:23,819
have access through the API and web

00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:25,379
hooks they do that so sponsor functions

00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:26,249
is an open source repo definitely check

00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,199
it out

00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:30,419
one of my my friends here at github as

00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:33,300
well build another action built on the

00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:35,610
Activity Feed an API where you can

00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,380
actually identify any issues opened if

00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,449
they are a sponsor so if you have a

00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,159
sponsor that's opening up issues and you

00:08:39,449 --> 00:08:42,209
want to address those first because

00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,250
they're helping you out you might as

00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:44,939
well help them out you can actually do

00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,339
that for here

00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:49,380
and it goes really with my motto which

00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:53,010
is if you like it put a label on it

00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,060
number six save replies now self explain

00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,940
the poor in a lot of these feature

00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,130
their name really well I think naming is

00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:02,640
very difficult in engineering but we

00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:04,920
sort of got that down pack Sabre applies

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:09,120
it really is saving replies so

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:11,610
definitely use that today / 5 the triage

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,140
role now we've shipped last summer a

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,310
couple different roles one being the

00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,410
maintainer role the other one being the

00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,450
triage role and I am a big fan of the

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,460
triage role as I mentioned before I talk

00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,630
to a lot of open source projects and I

00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,740
let them and know about all the features

00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,890
that they're maybe they're missing out

00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:28,020
on if I see some some gaps and the the

00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,820
things that are using and one of the

00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,260
best examples I've seen so far is

00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,780
expressed yes I know they've got I

00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,130
mentioned earlier in an earlier talk but

00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,950
I want to give another mention which is

00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:39,900
their triage our guide they onboarding

00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:42,810
into open source project can be daunting

00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:45,210
and challenging and they are leveraging

00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:48,120
the triage role to onboard new

00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:50,100
contributors so rather than blindly go

00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,200
to a good first issue and contribute and

00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,720
ship some code and hopefully it works in

00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,540
a past test instead onboard to the

00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,840
triage process so look at issues label

00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,770
them review peer review requests one of

00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,570
the best things that you could do as a

00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:06,000
new developer in any team is a review

00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:09,240
request and close bugs or open issues or

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,920
even label issues like all that sort of

00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,210
stuff the stuff that our maintain errs

00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,040
want to get back to do on a date on a

00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,020
regular basis which is writing code it

00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,000
tends to be bogged down by things like

00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:23,100
this so definitely leverage triage role

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,980
today number four code search tips now

00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,320
this is a not actual feature but it is a

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,360
feature which I'll talk about in a sec

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,970
last week I was actually live streaming

00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,470
some code on Twitch and I went to search

00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,290
for the Axios library which is a fetch

00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,670
library built in JavaScript and this is

00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,590
what happened I googled for it and this

00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,240
is I ended up just getting some random

00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:44,130
stuff on Google I was hoping to find

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,070
this which is like the actual github

00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,900
repo my problem was I was not using the

00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,400
proper search feature so in search you

00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,350
have these different flags week actually

00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,300
enable as you're searching so if I was

00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,430
searching for them any repos with the

00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,500
name Axios I would have found it even if

00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,930
I was searching in the readme for the

00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,550
the term node fetch because those are

00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,710
mentioned in there and the actuals Bible

00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:07,560
a library it would have shown up for me

00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:09,870
also you can also search but I

00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,520
so I've been working on SVG animations

00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,800
and I want to find any projects that

00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,020
have more than 3000 stars I'm able to

00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,490
find that and finally of course if you

00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,260
want to check out my babeh which is

00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:22,140
going to be open source soon you could

00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:26,400
check out all the forks from 10 to 20

00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:28,440
and find my baby bots and this is an

00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,300
example of me searching I also want to

00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,279
point out that github comm slash search

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,720
is a viable solution as well if you just

00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:36,089
don't know where to start

00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,200
this used this omnibar I'm also going to

00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:39,540
point out that highlighted in red

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,850
there's a link to learn more about those

00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,500
prefixes that I was talking about now

00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,060
I've said a lot and I'm gonna say a lot

00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:49,770
more so I'm gonna talk about honorable

00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:51,029
mentions first up and I know Maya

00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,730
actually mentioned this which is to

00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:56,130
factor off please enable it second one

00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:58,170
another owner add a second owner to your

00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:59,279
repository if you're the only one doing

00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,750
everything and everybody has to go

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,880
through you it's gonna be a bottleneck

00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,980
how to second owner also I'm a big fan

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,600
of the bus factor so if you get hit by a

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,600
bus at least some of this consults can

00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,240
take over while you recover and then

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,040
also choose a license calm so if you

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,350
haven't enabled our added licenses to

00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,010
you your open source repository

00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:19,589
definitely check that out if you're

00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:23,130
concerned and which licenses are fit for

00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:24,960
you finally last honorable mention is

00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:27,000
the new notifications dashboard and

00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,770
mobile and I everybody's been talking

00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,460
about this today I'm a big fan maybe

00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:33,870
Ryan doesn't need anymore anymore

00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,000
happiness here of all this all these

00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,260
mentions for his his feature but I do

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,640
want to mention that this is an awesome

00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:41,100
feature I mentioned these together

00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,870
because they actually they influence

00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,030
each other so I mentioned the github

00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:46,650
hackathon dot-com earlier I was able to

00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,180
leverage that through pull requests for

00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:50,160
the github Agathon at 2:00 a.m. when I

00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,410
was seeing a lot of the hackathon gets

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,630
kickstart at 12:00 a.m. and I was able

00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,010
to emerge PRS and label them directly

00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:59,640
from my phone as I rolled over in the

00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:02,400
bed so I'm a big fan of the of the

00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:06,570
mobile app and I also think that this is

00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:10,290
a hit alright so around the corner I got

00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:12,360
the last three rfcs for discussions now

00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:15,089
I know Becca literally just talked right

00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,190
before me about discussions and I just

00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:19,140
wanted to shout this out again because I

00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,000
think this is a huge feature it also was

00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,410
mentioned that RCS can

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,970
hidden in issues and could be

00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,470
overwhelming and the cool thing about

00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,480
discussion is that you could have them

00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:30,540
directly in the conversation there you

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,589
can get you can get suggested answers so

00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,000
if you have a lot of questions that come

00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:35,759
to you converted the issue into a

00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,490
discussion leveraged at also leveraged

00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:41,610
dreaded issues are threaded replies as

00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:45,209
well so definitely opt into that get in

00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:47,819
the beta and start using that today next

00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:49,230
security advisories and CVEs again

00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:51,600
another thing that's been mentioned all

00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:54,300
day but it is a top feature it's a big

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,819
deal github has 450 million developers

00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,310
worldwide it is our duty to provide

00:13:56,819 --> 00:14:02,310
features like this for our community so

00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:04,139
if you want to start enabling security

00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:06,810
policies on your repo definitely check

00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:09,360
out the security tab talk to the PM team

00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:11,759
talk to support to get your repos

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,170
enabled today not only do you get access

00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,389
to that but we also have a public

00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:17,879
database for advisories as well so if

00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:20,250
you're concerned about what the details

00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:22,410
of the advisory is if your code is

00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,490
affected based on whatever functions or

00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,740
endpoints that you're leveraging

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:29,360
definitely leverage that database and

00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:32,399
then again mention earlier security lab

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,680
security lab is an awesome resource for

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,899
security researchers to also share

00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,600
information in addition to the database

00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:41,160
powered by code QL as well if you aren't

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,670
aware you should definitely check it out

00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:47,100
and then finally number one create

00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:49,529
community again I'm following up some of

00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,990
the best speakers all day which is that

00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:53,160
Becca and Maya Becca spent that last

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,959
half hour talking about talking about

00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,569
commit me but I have a personal

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,129
experience where my introduction into

00:14:57,569 --> 00:15:00,389
the per block community was through

00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:02,519
their office hours they actually had a

00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:03,870
calendar that I was invited to actually

00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,639
meet the team before I contributed my

00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:08,610
first line of code so definitely check

00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:10,860
that out and hopefully as a project
