	Presented by Sasha Rosenbaum, Product Manager, GitHub

How long does it take you to get a new developer up to speed on an open source project or an enterprise development team? Three weeks? Three days? Learn how new GitHub features can save you valuable onboarding time—and get developers ready to code faster.

GitHub Satellite: A community connected by code

On May 6th, we threw a free virtual event featuring developers working together on the world’s software, announcements from the GitHub team, and inspiring performances by artists who code.

yeah for sure so next we have how to get

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,600
to

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,960
um from idea to contribution in minutes

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,480
that's presented by one of our own

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,280
product managers at github

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,120
sasha rosenbaum who chairs delivery comp

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,679
which is a conference center around ci

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,520
and cd she's an organizer of devops days

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,400
in chicago who has experience in

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,080
development

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,439
operations consulting and cloud

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:31,840
architecture so

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:31,840
without further ado sasha take it away

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,160
all right thank you all for coming with

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,640
welcome to

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,840
github satellite i'm so happy you're

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,879
able to join us

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,760
from wherever you are in the world today

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,480
and like cheetah said my name is sasha

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,199
osmaum

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,680
i work for github um you can find me on

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,079
github as the vine ops as well as on

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,960
twitter by the same username

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,719
and i have some pretty excited new

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,680
feature to talk about today

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,040
but before that i also actually have

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,600
some great news

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:12,720
about you so congratulations

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,280
actually you just got a new job

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,640
and that is completely awesome and since

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,759
you're a developer

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,040
that means that you get to do coding

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,479
straight away

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,360
right well usually that's not how it

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,000
works

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,880
usually first you need to do a couple of

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,360
things

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,000
so first you need to get a developer

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,119
machine

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,600
and that might take a little while then

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,680
you need to get access to source control

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,240
and all the internal tools and all the

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,840
stuff

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,240
that you need to get to your projects

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,880
then you need to install your developer

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,200
tools

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,119
and even if your machine came with the

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,040
developer tools pre-installed

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,360
usually you need to do a lot of

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,159
configuration to get them just the right

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,640
way

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,439
right and then of course you need to

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,000
install

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,840
all of your dependencies and these

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,719
sometimes can take a while

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,280
just before you even get to compile your

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,720
project

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,040
sometimes you get to spend quite a while

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,959
getting it all set up so how long

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,760
usually does it take before you can

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,520
actually write your first line of code

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,000
well

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,040
let's say if it took two hours that

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,520
would be great

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,840
usually offices come with pretty nice

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,239
coffee machines and i'm a coffee person

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,120
so

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,000
i don't mind an extra cup of coffee but

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,000
um

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,080
from my personal experience in no

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,800
organization did it take two hours for

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,840
me to just be able to get started

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,519
um maybe it takes two days that's okay i

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,959
can consume a little bit more coffee

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,519
maybe read a handbook

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,800
and you know understand the organization

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,840
better that's great

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,000
um but sometimes we're getting more like

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,480
into two weeks that's a more realistic

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,640
time frame and by that time i'm like oh

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,879
wow i'm consuming a lot of coffee

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,280
without actually contributing

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,040
anything of value to my projects that

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,760
i'm supposed to be working on

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,879
right and then sometimes in some

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,920
organizations

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,480
it can actually even take longer for you

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,400
to even get productive and this is a

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,200
problem that a github we've been

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,000
thinking about

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,440
for a while and this was a dream to

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
enable developers to

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,280
work from anywhere and just be able to

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,560
get started

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,280
right away right so um today

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,720
if you went to natsuki note you might

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,519
already

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,400
know what's coming up but today we have

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,280
a solution

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,640
to that problem and that solution is

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,879
called

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,920
codespaces so codespaces is cloud-based

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,720
full powered developer environment which

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,280
you can

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,159
work on from anywhere inside your

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,439
browser

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,000
it is hosted by github and powered by vs

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,599
code

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and you can bring all of your

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,560
dependencies and all of your tools right

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,599
with you so you can get productive right

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,159
away

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,200
and that sounds amazing but it also kind

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,319
of sounds like

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,879
magic so so that you believe me

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,879
i'm going to actually demonstrate some

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:18,239
of that goodness

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,959
so let's get into a demo and i'm going

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,840
to do

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,040
the demo live so hopefully it all works

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,160
just fine

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,919
all right so let me go right here

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,440
um so my co-worker matt has been working

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,880
on this application

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,000
um where he has written some haikus for

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,919
his dog

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,080
um and i've been meaning to contribute

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,320
to that application for actually

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,840
a little while but i kind of haven't

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,800
gotten around to it

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,280
so now i fork the repository and i've

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,479
actually

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,400
already created works a codespace so

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,759
you will notice that my buttons here

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,560
changed a little bit

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,960
so now when i go in here i can actually

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,560
see

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,880
the opening code spaces and then i can

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,000
click on here since i already have one

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,039
existing

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,560
so this will just take us a moment

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,240
if you're starting from scratch it may

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,120
take us a little bit longer but

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,360
since we already have one um we're just

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,320
starting it up

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,759
so all right we landed right here and

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,720
you can see it's a simple node

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,759
application

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,000
so since i want to make a change usually

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,880
i

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,680
just would like to get started by seeing

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,560
if the app

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,479
really works so i'm just going to come

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,440
into the terminal

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,600
and do node non-start um and then i can

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,320
browse to my remote explorer from right

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,039
here

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,639
and see that we have forwarded port 3000

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,800
for this application

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,800
so let's see if i can browse right to it

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,880
all right this is cool so this is a

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,720
this is matt's lovely dog it's amazing

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,520
and i think it's enjoying quarantine

00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,080
quite a bit

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:03,840
so um i'm gonna add a haiku now for

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,160
on for june so she can have a new friend

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,560
so i'm gonna come into haikus and i'm

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,240
going to make a change right here

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:15,280
um so bear with me one second

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,759
while i bring in a new haiku

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,319
all right there we go and then you will

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,120
notice

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,560
that on all the haikus came with images

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,520
so we probably need an

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,319
image to go with it so let's just go in

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,440
here

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,240
and see if we can find a good image for

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,440
this

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,440
now i'm more of a cat person so

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,479
with that we're gonna bring a cat friend

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,960
for june

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:42,400
all right so let's just see if any of

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,400
our changes actually worked

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,960
all right so we got it right here so if

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,759
you notice

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,280
i just had a full experience of

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,440
developing code

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,639
right online right in my browser i

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,120
didn't have any

00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,840
to i didn't have to install any tools

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,400
i'm in

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,039
all of my application just worked right

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,479
away

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:09,120
so to me this is amazing and this means

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,680
that you can do so many things

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,960
without actually owning a super powerful

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,560
developer machine

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,720
so let's just go back into the

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,599
presentation and talk a little bit

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,800
about on the use cases that we could

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,000
potentially

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,800
address with code spaces

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,280
so the first in near and dear to our

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,400
hearts

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,560
is contributing to open source right and

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,919
a lot of times when you come across an

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,680
open source project

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,840
and you want to contribute and then you

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,599
take a look at all the dependencies

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,160
and you realize that it would take you a

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,800
good day to just get it up and running

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,639
and by that time your desire to

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,160
contribute is kind of gone

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:52,639
right or maybe you just like on the go

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,280
somewhere and then you notice that this

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,919
project

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,360
is like has a vulnerability reported and

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,599
you would like to

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,800
really like the fix maybe it's just an

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,039
upgrade of a version

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,319
and it would really take just a minute

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,840
or two um

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,599
and you would like to contribute it

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,440
right there but um

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,960
you're unable to do that because you

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,520
don't have your developer machine with

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,240
you

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,960
well with code spaces you are able to

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,960
contribute

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,319
right from your browser from absolutely

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,720
anywhere also

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,479
if you are in a country where you might

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,960
not have access to

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,120
strong developer machines you can have

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,280
that with codespaces so long as you have

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,199
access to the internet into the browser

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,800
you'll be able to develop using code

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,839
spaces

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,640
then of course if we come into

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,640
new team collaboration we just saw that

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,519
in that case where i got a new job

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,320
i could be starting to contribute within

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,720
minutes

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,519
rather than within weeks and that's an

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,560
incredible

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,200
time savings um and then this happens

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,519
quite a bit

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,560
i might be developing something on the

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,120
branch and my

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,600
changes might not be in a good shape to

00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,440
commit

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,080
yet and then i get a ping from a

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,640
coworker asking me to actually

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,600
go and review his code so it can go into

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,040
production

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,800
and um i i am unable to review that pull

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,880
request or switch a branch or

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,080
make any changes there but with code

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,800
spaces i could

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,440
actually just go um into a separate

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,720
environment

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,800
and contribute anything that i needed

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,279
um and then of course conflicting

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,160
dependencies so maybe i have a package

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,399
version

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,680
that conflicts between two projects that

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,640
actually happens

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,320
and it gets um very hairy to deal with

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,040
that on a single machine

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,920
um or maybe i just don't want to install

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,880
a mongodb

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,920
driver on on my local machine right with

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,120
codespaces

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,360
i can do this without actually polluting

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,959
my development environment and then of

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,680
course as a company

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,760
you can choose to have your entire team

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,839
work entirely in code spaces

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,920
so that you don't have to provision

00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,640
expensive development machine

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,120
machines and if your developers switch

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,800
between

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,519
projects they can bring their developer

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,519
development environment

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,640
quote unquote with them and develop on

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,760
the project that is

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,680
relevant right now so how do you get

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,079
started with all the goodness

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,000
so first of all you have to enroll in

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,200
beta this product is now in beta

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,720
and so you are able to sign up today for

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,000
the beta

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,959
um and then if you do you'll be able to

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
just come in

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,120
into your familiar github landing page

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,240
for a repository

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:37,279
and getting to open with code spaces

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,440
and then it will automatically spin up

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,160
a new code space for you and it will

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,200
automatically spin up a new container

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,680
so that um there is a default image

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,040
and it will provision it for you so you

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,160
don't actually have to do

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,480
anything so it will do a spin up screen

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,720
for

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,519
a minute and then you will land in a

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,320
page that

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,040
looks approximately like this right so

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,920
without

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,279
any configuration i don't have anything

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,440
in here that is

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,720
very interesting it's just a very simple

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,480
node application

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,920
i'm i'm all about simple node

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,680
applications today

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,279
so um let's just do another demo

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,720
of something that we can do with

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,519
codespaces

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,160
so let me switch context once again in

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,680
the end

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,160
i'm going to go into another repo so

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,959
this is yet another simple node

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,279
application

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,279
and i'm going to open it in a code space

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,519
so in terms of getting started with this

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,120
we just said that we could just get

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,800
started by clicking

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,720
like open with codespace and we'll

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,360
automatically provision a new container

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,120
for you

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,279
but you could also configure your

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,160
environment to look exactly the way you

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,640
want it

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,480
right so i'm going to explore a little

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,200
bit of the things that you can do with

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,200
this

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,040
so you will notice that there is a dev

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,920
container folder in here

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,839
and then in here we have a couple files

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,000
so we have a docker file

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,079
um and in this case i'm just pulling a

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,560
microsoft container image

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,519
then i'm configuring node user so i

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,399
don't have to run

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,120
with a default route and then i am just

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,440
installing

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,040
a single dependency i'm planning to use

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,720
my sql

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,560
in this application so i'm just

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,639
installing it in the container

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,720
so that it's installed in my developer

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,200
environment and so i could bring

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,959
all of my dependencies bake them into a

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,519
docker image that i'm using

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,480
and then use them in my application and

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,680
then

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,720
um more importantly there is a dev

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,360
container file

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,240
so i can get configuration set up here

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,760
as well

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,680
so i have the docker file configured so

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,720
which docker file i'm looking at

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,959
i have an app port that is open um and

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,079
i don't have to open any ports but if

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,120
i'm opening a port

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:55,200
so in this application i'm opening 3000.

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,560
then i'm configuring which remote user

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,639
i'm going to run with

00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,839
i'm and then i'm configuring what my

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,360
bash is

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:06,079
so another thing i can do is to choose a

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,600
post create command so for the postgrade

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,920
command and you can see that i can run

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,440
multiple ones or i can run a script

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,519
but i can basically do npm install

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,279
or in this case i'm installing nodemon

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,320
so i can monitor changes

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,160
right so my app when it starts up when

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,279
the code space comes fully baked with

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,320
things i need

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,639
and then of course you can install vs

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,720
code extensions so all your favorite vs

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,800
code extensions that you know and love

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,440
can come with you into this online

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,600
editor because it's powered by vs code

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,000
and then if you've been paying attention

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:44,160
you might have also noticed that my

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,120
terminal here is a little bit custom so

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,399
it's actually like very cool because i

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,279
can also do

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,120
interesting brains like this so let me

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:58,079
just do

00:13:53,120 --> 00:14:00,160
it crack out i'm new branch

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,320
so you see that i automatically see

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,240
which branch i'm actually currently on

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,000
which is super helpful for me to know

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,199
which i'm going to contribute into

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,680
um so that i don't end up on installing

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,800
um

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,440
contributing to a wrong branch and then

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,839
where this configuration comes from is a

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,760
public repository oh

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,120
all right maybe it will go away in a

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,560
second

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,720
um it's a public repository called dot

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,639
file so i have my dot files

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:33,680
in here um and i have a batch prompt

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,160
script in here which configures what my

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,199
prompt

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,120
actually looks like so i have all of my

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,120
things configured so which branch i'm

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,920
looking at and what color

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,240
um and what what comes up as a prompt so

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,320
if you have a dot files repo

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,320
that configuration can come fully with

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,600
you and it spins up automatically with

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,760
code spaces

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,279
and then another super cool thing that i

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,399
can do right from here

00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:01,440
is i can launch a debugger so um

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,959
let me just switch to a file that might

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,040
have something more interesting to look

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,279
at so and i'm gonna

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,079
actually put a breakpoint on here and

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,600
then i'm gonna

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:14,000
click on launch debugger

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,079
all right so it launched a debugger and

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,279
i can actually go to this url from right

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,880
here

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:24,160
so let's see all right so we got

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:28,560
into increasingly i'm basic homepage

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,880
and i happen to know that there is a url

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,440
for an api call so i'm just going to

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,440
type it in

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,160
okay so it stopped at a breakpoint let's

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,880
see all right so it

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,000
did stop at a breakpoint and i have js

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,920
data in here

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,360
so that doesn't help me very much what i

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,240
really would like to see is the

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,079
characters

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,000
and i'm watching that variable so let's

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,160
just make one step

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,639
all right so now i got the characters

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,480
and i can browse what is happening

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,959
in the character so i can see that the

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,320
data is correct when it's coming through

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,320
and then i just let it run

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,839
ah no damn

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:16,880
okay so we let it run

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,240
so it responded correctly so this way we

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,680
can start a debugger

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,880
fully from um fully from our code space

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,800
and actually have a fully powered editor

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,560
in our browser again i didn't have to

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,240
get anything installed i didn't have to

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,800
do anything specific

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,480
um and i just had the whole thing

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,920
working from my browser

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:41,440
so with that let me just switch back to

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,440
my presentation real quick

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,120
okay so um just to reiterate

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,880
everything that we've talked about you

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,800
can configure all your project

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,920
dependencies directly in your github

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,639
repository

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,079
so that it spins up directly with

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,240
everything that you need

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,920
and so as an open source maintainer for

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,199
instance you get to configure your

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,959
project dependencies

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,199
so that people who come to contribute

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,640
can spin up easily instead of spending

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,520
days on setup

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,240
right and then you can contribute from

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,199
anywhere

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,640
anytime so if you have a browser um and

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,039
if you have an internet connection

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,760
you'll be able to spin up code spaces

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,679
and contribute to your favorite project

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,400
so what can you do today

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,760
well first of all you can check out the

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,520
sign up for beta

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,520
link and so you can read a little bit

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,480
more about code spaces and sign up for

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,440
beta

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,039
and then on you can also read our docs

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,240
about code spaces

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,640
and then last but not least you can read

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,200
about

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,440
vs code dev container docs so that

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,919
feature is available today in preview so

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,679
you can

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,039
start playing with this code dev

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,320
containers right away

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,600
so you kind of ramp up on on code spaces

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,760
that way

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,360
all right so with that thank you very

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,840
much and i believe we're going to

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,840
questions

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,160
thank you sasha i really really love

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,160
that

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,000
super pumped it's almost like cut spaces

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,679
is like a dream come true

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,640
world-class development environment in

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,320
the browser with powered by vs code

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,240
it comes pre-configured for your

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,960
environment all your dot files all your

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,960
git config

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,720
everything is there if you're in a

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,919
country where you might not have access

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,480
to a strong machine

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,919
with scope spaces you can't do that as

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,760
long as you have access

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,600
to an internet and with this dev

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,039
container thing

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,760
this is going to usher in a new

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,760
revolution the same kind of revolution

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,360
we've seen in productions with docker

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,480
we're going to see the same revolution

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,799
in development

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,559
and remember everybody we've gotten some

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,360
of your questions teed up and all ready

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,679
to go

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,679
and our first question is gonna come

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,600
from i'm looking at it now

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,039
all right we've got first questions

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,760
matthew we're

00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:00,559
nine get abuser matthew redney says

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,960
coke's racist seems too good to be true

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:05,600
sasha he wants to know what's the catch

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,880
is there a couchsurfer

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,080
so there is no catch i believe um but it

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,919
is currently in beta

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,919
so once you are able to get access

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,840
you'll be able to play with it yourself

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,840
and you're going to see that it is ultra

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,760
all right all right trader you have

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,480
anything you want to add to that do you

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,080
think it's

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,080
is it catch is it a magic

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,840
i don't think there's a catch uh i think

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,480
it might be magic but if it works i'll

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,559
take it

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,760
uh one thing i wanted to bring up is um

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,400
funky penguin

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,520
asked um or stated i hope this will work

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,000
on an ipad

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,200
um with vs code slash code server not

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,160
doing copy and paste

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,120
nicely on ipad or oh what ipad os on

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,559
safari so

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,160
i have the same questions i want to use

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,799
this on my ipad so what's your

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,880
what's your thought process there sasha

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,799
yes so if you're able to spin up a

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,480
browser you should be able to use

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,200
codespaces from anywhere

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,720
anywhere including your ipad and again

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,039
if you try it during the beta

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,840
give us your feedback um if you see any

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,480
issues

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,080
um the other thing that i haven't really

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,760
had a chance to mention

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,600
is that you could if you have a

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,320
developer machine and you have vs code

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,880
installed

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,600
you can actually connect from to a

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,320
codespace

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,360
from your desktop and actually also run

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,080
in a development

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,760
environment that way so it's an

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,840
additional bonus but again you don't

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,200
have to have vs code installed at all

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,679
uh for this to work cool and i want to

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,679
try it get out

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:39,600
all right github user hansel hence

00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,919
hence00 says how does codespaces handle

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,520
secrets for example you're using a

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,679
codespace to write your code

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,440
and to debug the code running you want

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,280
to provide a secret via environment

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,960
variable or something similar

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,440
but you don't want that secret to be

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,159
persisted anywhere online

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,280
as per one of the previous talks how do

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,840
you provide these

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,000
values to the code space how do we do

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,039
that

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,600
yeah so i i think in terms of checking

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,159
it in

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,960
um the regular github process in terms

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,200
of checking

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,960
that secrets haven't been changed uh

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,360
they haven't been checked in is gonna

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,880
kick

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:20,240
in so it isn't specific to code space

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:23,600
um and in terms of giving its secrets um

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,080
i think you should be you know mindful

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,640
about

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,440
what you save in public variables and

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,440
configurations

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,240
yeah yeah i want to dive deeper on that

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,039
um uh

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,919
hopping on the persistencies so how does

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,679
um how does uh

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,200
code spaces handle persistence with your

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,159
databases and things you're setting up

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,760
are those living

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,679
forever until you press a button or do

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,600
they kind of disappear after x amount of

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,919
time

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,200
yeah so they go into suspension so

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,240
obviously it's not going to keep

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,480
spinning so

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,080
if you are not using it for about half

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,799
an hour it's going to suspend

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,320
but it's going to save the state and so

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,360
for instance even if you have not

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,200
committed code

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,120
it's still going to be safe there unless

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,679
you delete it if you delete it it goes

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,080
away

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,159
so again if you have code and you want

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,440
to commit it to a repository obviously

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,200
you want to go to

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,600
through commit and pull requests and all

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,600
the normal process

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,200
awesome cool we have more questions

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,280
coming okay

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,240
so there's a user i cannot pronounce the

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,360
name anger in this scissors is the

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,480
codespace config persistent across repos

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,559
or is this specific to each repo

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,039
for instance let's say i use a specific

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,440
set of problems most of the time

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,240
do i need to configure it in each of the

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,080
code space

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,400
instances or is this just persisted

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,480
across all of them

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,320
so i didn't hear the last part of the

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,840
question but okay let me

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,760
i'll read it again let's just read it

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,559
again so that we're all on the same page

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,760
right is the code spaces config

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,039
persistent

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:02,080
across repos or is this specific

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,919
to each repo for instance

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,080
let's say i use a specific set of

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,080
programs most of the time

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,799
do i need to configure it in each

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:14,000
codespace instance

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:16,480
yeah so it's specific to each repo i

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,280
am not able to answer if we're looking

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,760
into

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,039
doing it across different repos so that

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,280
like to save you time

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,120
in terms of like across organization

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,840
right now what it is it's specific to

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,880
repo

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,919
so if you had the same configuration um

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,159
then you you need to be uh basically

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,559
copying it over to a different one

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,840
uh just because a lot of times you do

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,400
want something different

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,520
in a different repository right and it's

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,360
easy enough to

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,600
basically bring in the same

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,159
configuration the dot files

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,200
are across the entire thing so my dot

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,240
files from

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,919
github basically are on persistent

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,919
across all of my code spaces

00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,760
i see do you have any other questions

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,200
you want to chime in trader

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,000
do you want to talk over it yeah for

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,279
sure yeah i waited this time i was

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,240
waiting for the gap waiting for you to

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,919
kind of punt it over

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,279
um so with the dot file so i've heard

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,279
about them for quite some time i've

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,279
continued to kick the can down the road

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,880
can you explain the transition from not

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:19,520
using dot files to using dot files

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,120
yeah so i don't think i even take full

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,360
advantage of them myself

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,799
right but you can configure certain

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,440
things that you like

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,080
um and then they will basically just

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,880
happen

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,240
across all of your repositories right so

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,600
you don't have to keep

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,240
um reconfiguring the same environment um

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,440
over and over so as a for instance that

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,080
terminal prompt

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,200
like i i used to actually every single

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,080
computer that i get

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,960
i used to um you know set up the

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,720
terminal prompt

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,360
exactly the way i like it now i don't

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,360
have to do that

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,559
cool so is that like a 20 minute kind of

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,919
transition or does it take a little bit

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,960
more time and effort to make the switch

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,440
so i think

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,600
you know it especially if it's all open

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,480
source so if you copy over and fork it

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,240
from somebody

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,679
um you can get started really really

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,520
quickly

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,000
cool i think that is what i am going to

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,440
do to get

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,120
started i'm not going to i'm just going

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,120
to take another person's help

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,480
we have one we have some other questions

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,320
coming in sasha

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,559
um this mr marker mark rocco says sasha

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,600
thank you so much for the presentation

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:31,360
question can i run two instances of the

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,640
editor connected

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,200
using the same container for example

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,880
can i speak up can i spin up a restful

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,000
api back end in one

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,880
instance and front end in another

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,159
but kind of connected so i can debug

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,919
both the front end

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,919
and the back end at the same time it's

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,840
excellent question

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,960
so it is an excellent question i don't

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,000
have an answer to that

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,880
uh but alison um who was in

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,440
the uh keynote today is also answering

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,240
the question

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,679
in the discussion so um she might be

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,679
able to answer that question for you

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,520
that would be awesome if we could get

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,400
that to happen

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,559
yes before i step over you again do you

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,559
have any other questions

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,919
yeah yeah so it seems that code spaces

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,000
is going to be absolutely

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,679
simple to use on the kind of consumer

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,279
side of things um but what's it like

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,279
setting up the configuration is that

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,600
that pretty simple require a little bit

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,120
more

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:31,919
of expertise yeah so did you see me like

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,039
i i could get started right away from

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,360
nothing at all so

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,039
it as long as you get access to it you

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,840
can get started by simply clicking a

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,480
button

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,320
now if you want to figure out something

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,279
quote unquote smarter to do with the

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,000
code space and

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,559
and have your specific configuration set

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,430
up then

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,000
probably you need to read the docs

00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:53,360
[Music]

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,120
cool back to you emoji okay and where

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,000
can we sign up for beta again

00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,840
where can we sign up for the beta yes so

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,760
maybe that's a good idea

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:06,799
to um have these links so the first link

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,200
um is where you can say request early

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,200
access

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,840
thank you so much yes so everybody you

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,720
can see where you can sign up for the

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,279
beta

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,640
um i'm gonna go use code spaces it's

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,640
like you know it's fun it's like a dream

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,640
come true so thank you to everybody at

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,640
the team who made this happen

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,159
and that is the end of our q a and

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,159
remember she's gonna continue in

00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,840
