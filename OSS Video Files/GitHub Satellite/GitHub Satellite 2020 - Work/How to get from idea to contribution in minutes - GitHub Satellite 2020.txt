	Presented by Sasha Rosenbaum, Product Manager, GitHub

How long does it take you to get a new developer up to speed on an open source project or an enterprise development team? Three weeks? Three days? Learn how new GitHub features can save you valuable onboarding timeâ€”and get developers ready to code faster.

GitHub Satellite: A community connected by code

On May 6th, we threw a free virtual event featuring developers working together on the worldâ€™s software, announcements from the GitHub team, and inspiring performances by artists who code.

yeah for sure so next we have how to get

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,600
to

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,960
um from idea to contribution in minutes

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,480
that's presented by one of our own

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,280
product managers at github

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,120
sasha rosenbaum who chairs delivery comp

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,679
which is a conference center around ci

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,520
and cd she's an organizer of devops days

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,400
in chicago who has experience in

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,080
development

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,439
operations consulting and cloud

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:31,840
architecture so

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:31,840
without further ado sasha take it away

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,160
all right thank you all for coming with

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,640
welcome to

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,840
github satellite i'm so happy you're

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,879
able to join us

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,760
from wherever you are in the world today

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,480
and like cheetah said my name is sasha

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,199
osmaum

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,680
i work for github um you can find me on

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,079
github as the vine ops as well as on

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,960
twitter by the same username

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,719
and i have some pretty excited new

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,680
feature to talk about today

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,040
but before that i also actually have

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,600
some great news

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:12,720
about you so congratulations

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,280
actually you just got a new job

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,640
and that is completely awesome and since

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,759
you're a developer

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,040
that means that you get to do coding

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,479
straight away

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,360
right well usually that's not how it

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,000
works

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,880
usually first you need to do a couple of

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,360
things

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,000
so first you need to get a developer

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,119
machine

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,600
and that might take a little while then

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,680
you need to get access to source control

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,240
and all the internal tools and all the

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,840
stuff

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,240
that you need to get to your projects

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,880
then you need to install your developer

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,200
tools

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,119
and even if your machine came with the

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,040
developer tools pre-installed

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,360
usually you need to do a lot of

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,159
configuration to get them just the right

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,640
way

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,439
right and then of course you need to

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,000
install

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,840
all of your dependencies and these

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,719
sometimes can take a while

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,280
just before you even get to compile your

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,720
project

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,040
sometimes you get to spend quite a while

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,959
getting it all set up so how long

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,760
usually does it take before you can

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,520
actually write your first line of code

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,000
well

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,040
let's say if it took two hours that

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,520
would be great

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,840
usually offices come with pretty nice

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,239
coffee machines and i'm a coffee person

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,120
so

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,000
i don't mind an extra cup of coffee but

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,000
um

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,080
from my personal experience in no

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,800
organization did it take two hours for

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,840
me to just be able to get started

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,519
um maybe it takes two days that's okay i

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,959
can consume a little bit more coffee

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,519
maybe read a handbook

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,800
and you know understand the organization

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,840
better that's great

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,000
um but sometimes we're getting more like

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,480
into two weeks that's a more realistic

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,640
time frame and by that time i'm like oh

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,879
wow i'm consuming a lot of coffee

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,280
without actually contributing

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,040
anything of value to my projects that

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,760
i'm supposed to be working on

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,879
right and then sometimes in some

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,920
organizations

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,480
it can actually even take longer for you

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,400
to even get productive and this is a

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,200
problem that a github we've been

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,000
thinking about

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,440
for a while and this was a dream to

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
enable developers to

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,280
work from anywhere and just be able to

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,560
get started

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,280
right away right so um today

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,720
if you went to natsuki note you might

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,519
already

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,400
know what's coming up but today we have

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,280
a solution

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,640
to that problem and that solution is

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,879
called

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,920
codespaces so codespaces is cloud-based

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,720
full powered developer environment which

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,280
you can

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,159
work on from anywhere inside your

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,439
browser

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,000
it is hosted by github and powered by vs

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,599
code

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and you can bring all of your

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,560
dependencies and all of your tools right

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,599
with you so you can get productive right

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,159
away

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,200
and that sounds amazing but it also kind

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,319
of sounds like

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,879
magic so so that you believe me

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,879
i'm going to actually demonstrate some

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:18,239
of that goodness

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,959
so let's get into a demo and i'm going

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,840
to do

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,040
the demo live so hopefully it all works

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,160
just fine

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,919
all right so let me go right here

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,440
um so my co-worker matt has been working

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,880
on this application

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,000
um where he has written some haikus for

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,919
his dog

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,080
um and i've been meaning to contribute

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,320
to that application for actually

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,840
a little while but i kind of haven't

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,800
gotten around to it

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,280
so now i fork the repository and i've

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,479
actually

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,400
already created works a codespace so

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,759
you will notice that my buttons here

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,560
changed a little bit

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,960
so now when i go in here i can actually

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,560
see

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,880
the opening code spaces and then i can

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,000
click on here since i already have one

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,039
existing

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,560
so this will just take us a moment

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,240
if you're starting from scratch it may

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,120
take us a little bit longer but

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,360
since we already have one um we're just

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,320
starting it up

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,759
so all right we landed right here and

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,720
you can see it's a simple node

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,759
application

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,000
so since i want to make a change usually

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,880
i

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,680
just would like to get started by seeing

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,560
if the app

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,479
really works so i'm just going to come

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,440
into the terminal

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,600
and do node non-start um and then i can

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,320
browse to my remote explorer from right

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,039
here

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,639
and see that we have forwarded port 3000

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,800
for this application

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,800
so let's see if i can browse right to it

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,880
all right this is cool so this is a

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,720
this is matt's lovely dog it's amazing

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,520
and i think it's enjoying quarantine

00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,080
quite a bit

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:03,840
so um i'm gonna add a haiku now for

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,160
on for june so she can have a new friend

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,560
so i'm gonna come into haikus and i'm

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,240
going to make a change right here

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:15,280
um so bear with me one second

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,759
while i bring in a new haiku

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,319
all right there we go and then you will

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,120
notice

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,560
that on all the haikus came with images

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,520
so we probably need an

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,319
image to go with it so let's just go in

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,440
here

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,240
and see if we can find a good image for

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,440
this

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,440
now i'm more of a cat person so

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,479
with that we're gonna bring a cat friend

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,960
for june

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:42,400
all right so let's just see if any of

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,400
our changes actually worked

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,960
all right so we got it right here so if

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,759
you notice

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,280
i just had a full experience of

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,440
developing code

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,639
right online right in my browser i

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,120
didn't have any

00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,840
to i didn't have to install any tools

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,400
i'm in

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,039
all of my application just worked right

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,479
away

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:09,120
so to me this is amazing and this means

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,680
that you can do so many things

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,960
without actually owning a super powerful

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,560
developer machine

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,720
so let's just go back into the

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,599
presentation and talk a little bit

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,800
about on the use cases that we could

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,000
potentially

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,800
address with code spaces

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,280
so the first in near and dear to our

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,400
hearts

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,560
is contributing to open source right and

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,919
a lot of times when you come across an

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,680
open source project

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,840
and you want to contribute and then you

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,599
take a look at all the dependencies

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,160
and you realize that it would take you a

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,800
good day to just get it up and running

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,639
and by that time your desire to

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,160
contribute is kind of gone

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:52,639
right or maybe you just like on the go

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,280
somewhere and then you notice that this

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,919
project

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,360
is like has a vulnerability reported and

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,599
you would like to

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,800
really like the fix maybe it's just an

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,039
upgrade of a version

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,319
and it would really take just a minute

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,840
or two um

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,599
and you would like to contribute it

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,440
right there but um

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,960
you're unable to do that because you

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,520
don't have your developer machine with

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,240
you

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,960
well with code spaces you are able to

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,960
contribute

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,319
right from your browser from absolutely

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,720
anywhere also

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,479
if you are in a country where you might

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,960
not have access to

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,120
strong developer machines you can have

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,280
that with codespaces so long as you have

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,199
access to the internet into the browser

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,800
you'll be able to develop using code

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,839
spaces

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,640
then of course if we come into

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,640
new team collaboration we just saw that

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,519
in that case where i got a new job

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,320
i could be starting to contribute within

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,720
minutes

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,519
rather than within weeks and that's an

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,560
incredible

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,200
time savings um and then this happens

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,519
quite a bit

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,560
i might be developing something on the

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,120
branch and my

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,600
changes might not be in a good shape to

00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,440
commit

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,080
yet and then i get a ping from a

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,640
coworker asking me to actually

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,600
go and review his code so it can go into

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,040
production

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,800
and um i i am unable to review that pull

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,880
request or switch a branch or

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,080
make any changes there but with code

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,800
spaces i could

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,440
actually just go um into a separate

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,720
environment

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,800
and contribute anything that i needed

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,279
um and then of course conflicting

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,160
dependencies so maybe i have a package

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,399
version

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,680
that conflicts between two projects that

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,640
actually happens

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,320
and it gets um very hairy to deal with

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,040
that on a single machine

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,920
um or maybe i just don't want to install

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,880
a mongodb

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,920
driver on on my local machine right with

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,120
codespaces

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,360
i can do this without actually polluting

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,959
my development environment and then of

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,680
course as a company

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,760
you can choose to have your entire team

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,839
work entirely in code spaces

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,920
so that you don't have to provision

00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,640
expensive development machine

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,120
machines and if your developers switch

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,800
between

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,519
projects they can bring their developer

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,519
development environment

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,640
quote unquote with them and develop on

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,760
the project that is

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,680
relevant right now so how do you get

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,079
started with all the goodness

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,000
so first of all you have to enroll in

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,200
beta this product is now in beta

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,720
and so you are able to sign up today for

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,000
the beta

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,959
um and then if you do you'll be able to

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
just come in

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,120
into your familiar github landing page

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,240
for a repository

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:37,279
and getting to open with code spaces

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,440
and then it will automatically spin up

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,160
a new code space for you and it will

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,200
automatically spin up a new container

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,680
so that um there is a default image

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,040
and it will provision it for you so you

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,160
don't actually have to do

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,480
anything so it will do a spin up screen

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,720
for

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,519
a minute and then you will land in a

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,320
page that

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,040
looks approximately like this right so

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,920
without

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,279
any configuration i don't have anything

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,440
in here that is

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,720
very interesting it's just a very simple

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,480
node application

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,920
i'm i'm all about simple node

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,680
applications today

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,279
so um let's just do another demo

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,720
of something that we can do with

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,519
codespaces

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,160
so let me switch context once again in

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,680
the end

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,160
i'm going to go into another repo so

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,959
this is yet another simple node

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,279
application

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,279
and i'm going to open it in a code space

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,519
so in terms of getting started with this

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,120
we just said that we could just get

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,800
started by clicking

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,720
like open with codespace and we'll

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,360
automatically provision a new container

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,120
for you

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,279
but you could also configure your

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,160
environment to look exactly the way you

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,640
want it

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,480
right so i'm going to explore a little

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,200
bit of the things that you can do with

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,200
this

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,040
so you will notice that there is a dev

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,920
container folder in here

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,839
and then in here we have a couple files

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,000
so we have a docker file

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,079
um and in this case i'm just pulling a

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,560
microsoft container image

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,519
then i'm configuring node user so i

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,399
don't have to run

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,120
with a default route and then i am just

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,440
installing

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,040
a single dependency i'm planning to use

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,720
my sql

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,560
in this application so i'm just

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,639
installing it in the container

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,720
so that it's installed in my developer

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,200
environment and so i could bring

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,959
all of my dependencies bake them into a

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,519
docker image that i'm using

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,480
and then use them in my application and

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,680
then

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,720
um more importantly there is a dev

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,360
container file

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,240
so i can get configuration set up here

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,760
as well

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,680
so i have the docker file configured so

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,720
which docker file i'm looking at

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,959
i have an app port that is open um and

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,079
i don't have to open any ports but if

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,120
i'm opening a port

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:55,200
so in this application i'm opening 3000.

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,560
then i'm configuring which remote user

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,639
i'm going to run with

00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,839
i'm and then i'm configuring what my

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,360
bash is

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:06,079
so another thing i can do is to choose a

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,600
post create command so for the postgrade

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,920
command and you can see that i can run

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,440
multiple ones or i can run a script

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,519
but i can basically do npm install

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,279
or in this case i'm installing nodemon

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,320
so i can monitor changes

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,160
right so my app when it starts up when

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,279
the code space comes fully baked with

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,320
things i need

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,639
and then of course you can install vs

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,720
code extensions so all your favorite vs

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,800
code extensions that you know and love

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,440
can come with you into this online

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,600
editor because it's powered by vs code

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,000
and then if you've been paying attention

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:44,160
you might have also noticed that my

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,120
terminal here is a little bit custom so

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,399
it's actually like very cool because i

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,279
can also do

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,120
interesting brains like this so let me

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:58,079
just do

00:13:53,120 --> 00:14:00,160
it crack out i'm new branch

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,320
so you see that i automatically see

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,240
which branch i'm actually currently on

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,000
which is super helpful for me to know

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,199
which i'm going to contribute into

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,680
um so that i don't end up on installing

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,800
um

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,440
contributing to a wrong branch and then

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,839
where this configuration comes from is a

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,760
public repository oh

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,120
all right maybe it will go away in a

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,560
second

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,720
um it's a public repository called dot

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,639
file so i have my dot files

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:33,680
in here um and i have a batch prompt

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,160
script in here which configures what my

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,199
prompt

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,120
actually looks like so i have all of my

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,120
things configured so which branch i'm

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,920
looking at and what color

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,240
um and what what comes up as a prompt so

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,320
if you have a dot files repo

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,320
that configuration can come fully with

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,600
you and it spins up automatically with

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,760
code spaces

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,279
and then another super cool thing that i

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,399
can do right from here

00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:01,440
is i can launch a debugger so um

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,959
let me just switch to a file that might

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,040
have something more interesting to look

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,279
at so and i'm gonna

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,079
actually put a breakpoint on here and

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,600
then i'm gonna

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:14,000
click on launch debugger

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,079
all right so it launched a debugger and

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,279
i can actually go to this url from right

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,880
here

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:24,160
so let's see all right so we got

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:28,560
into increasingly i'm basic homepage

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,880
and i happen to know that there is a url

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,440
for an api call so i'm just going to

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,440
type it in

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,160
okay so it stopped at a breakpoint let's

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,880
see all right so it

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,000
did stop at a breakpoint and i have js

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,920
data in here

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,360
so that doesn't help me very much what i

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,240
really would like to see is the

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,079
characters

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,000
and i'm watching that variable so let's

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,160
just make one step

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,639
all right so now i got the characters

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,480
and i can browse what is happening

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,959
in the character so i can see that the

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,320
data is correct when it's coming through

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,320
and then i just let it run

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,839
ah no damn

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:16,880
okay so we let it run

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,240
so it responded correctly so this way we

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,680
can start a debugger

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,880
fully from um fully from our code space

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,800
and actually have a fully powered editor

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,560
in our browser again i didn't have to

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,240
get anything installed i didn't have to

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,800
do anything specific

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,480
um and i just had the whole thing

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,920
working from my browser

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:41,440
so with that let me just switch back to

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,440
my presentation real quick

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,120
okay so um just to reiterate

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,880
everything that we've talked about you

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,800
can configure all your project

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,920
dependencies directly in your github

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,639
repository

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,079
so that it spins up directly with

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,240
everything that you need

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,920
and so as an open source maintainer for

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,199
instance you get to configure your

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,959
project dependencies

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,199
so that people who come to contribute

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,640
can spin up easily instead of spending

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,520
days on setup

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,240
right and then you can contribute from

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,199
anywhere

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,640
anytime so if you have a browser um and

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,039
if you have an internet connection

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,760
you'll be able to spin up code spaces

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,679
and contribute to your favorite project

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,400
so what can you do today

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,760
well first of all you can check out the

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,520
sign up for beta

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,520
link and so you can read a little bit

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,480
more about code spaces and sign up for

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,440
beta

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,039
and then on you can also read our docs

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,240
about code spaces

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,640
and then last but not least you can read

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,200
about

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,440
vs code dev container docs so that

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,919
feature is available today in preview so

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,679
you can

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,039
start playing with this code dev

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,320
containers right away

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,600
so you kind of ramp up on on code spaces

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,760
that way

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,360
all right so with that thank you very

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,840
much and i believe we're going to

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,840
questions

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,160
thank you sasha i really really love

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,160
that

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,000
super pumped it's almost like cut spaces

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,679
is like a dream come true

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,640
world-class development environment in

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,320
the browser with powered by vs code

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,240
it comes pre-configured for your

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,960
environment all your dot files all your

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,960
git config

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,720
everything is there if you're in a

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,919
country where you might not have access

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,480
to a strong machine

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,919
with scope spaces you can't do that as

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,760
long as you have access

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,600
to an internet and with this dev

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,039
container thing

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,760
this is going to usher in a new

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,760
revolution the same kind of revolution

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,360
we've seen in productions with docker

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,480
we're going to see the same revolution

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,799
in development

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,559
and remember everybody we've gotten some

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,360
of your questions teed up and all ready

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,679
to go

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,679
and our first question is gonna come

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,600
from i'm looking at it now

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,039
all right we've got first questions

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,760
matthew we're

00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:00,559
nine get abuser matthew redney says

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,960
coke's racist seems too good to be true

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:05,600
sasha he wants to know what's the catch

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,880
is there a couchsurfer

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,080
so there is no catch i believe um but it

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,919
is currently in beta

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,919
so once you are able to get access

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,840
you'll be able to play with it yourself

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,840
and you're going to see that it is ultra

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,760
all right all right trader you have

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,480
anything you want to add to that do you

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,080
think it's

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,080
is it catch is it a magic

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,840
i don't think there's a catch uh i think

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,480
it might be magic but if it works i'll

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,559
take it

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,760
uh one thing i wanted to bring up is um

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,400
funky penguin

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,520
asked um or stated i hope this will work

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,000
on an ipad

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,200
um with vs code slash code server not

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,160
doing copy and paste

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,120
nicely on ipad or oh what ipad os on

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,559
safari so

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,160
i have the same questions i want to use

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,799
this on my ipad so what's your

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,880
what's your thought process there sasha

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,799
yes so if you're able to spin up a

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,480
browser you should be able to use

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,200
codespaces from anywhere

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,720
anywhere including your ipad and again

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,039
if you try it during the beta

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,840
give us your feedback um if you see any

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,480
issues

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,080
um the other thing that i haven't really

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,760
had a chance to mention

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,600
is that you could if you have a

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,320
developer machine and you have vs code

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,880
installed

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,600
you can actually connect from to a

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,320
codespace

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,360
from your desktop and actually also run

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,080
in a development

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,760
environment that way so it's an

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,840
additional bonus but again you don't

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,200
have to have vs code installed at all

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,679
uh for this to work cool and i want to

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,679
try it get out

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:39,600
all right github user hansel hence

00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,919
hence00 says how does codespaces handle

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,520
secrets for example you're using a

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,679
codespace to write your code

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,440
and to debug the code running you want

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,280
to provide a secret via environment

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,960
variable or something similar

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,440
but you don't want that secret to be

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,159
persisted anywhere online

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,280
as per one of the previous talks how do

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,840
you provide these

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,000
values to the code space how do we do

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,039
that

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,600
yeah so i i think in terms of checking

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,159
it in

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,960
um the regular github process in terms

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,200
of checking

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,960
that secrets haven't been changed uh

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,360
they haven't been checked in is gonna

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,880
kick

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:20,240
in so it isn't specific to code space

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:23,600
um and in terms of giving its secrets um

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,080
i think you should be you know mindful

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,640
about

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,440
what you save in public variables and

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,440
configurations

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,240
yeah yeah i want to dive deeper on that

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,039
um uh

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,919
hopping on the persistencies so how does

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,679
um how does uh

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,200
code spaces handle persistence with your

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,159
databases and things you're setting up

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,760
are those living

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,679
forever until you press a button or do

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,600
they kind of disappear after x amount of

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,919
time

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,200
yeah so they go into suspension so

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,240
obviously it's not going to keep

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,480
spinning so

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,080
if you are not using it for about half

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,799
an hour it's going to suspend

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,320
but it's going to save the state and so

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,360
for instance even if you have not

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,200
committed code

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,120
it's still going to be safe there unless

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,679
you delete it if you delete it it goes

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,080
away

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,159
so again if you have code and you want

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,440
to commit it to a repository obviously

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,200
you want to go to

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,600
through commit and pull requests and all

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,600
the normal process

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,200
awesome cool we have more questions

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,280
coming okay

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,240
so there's a user i cannot pronounce the

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,360
name anger in this scissors is the

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,480
codespace config persistent across repos

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,559
or is this specific to each repo

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,039
for instance let's say i use a specific

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,440
set of problems most of the time

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,240
do i need to configure it in each of the

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,080
code space

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,400
instances or is this just persisted

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,480
across all of them

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,320
so i didn't hear the last part of the

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,840
question but okay let me

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,760
i'll read it again let's just read it

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,559
again so that we're all on the same page

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,760
right is the code spaces config

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,039
persistent

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:02,080
across repos or is this specific

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,919
to each repo for instance

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,080
let's say i use a specific set of

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,080
programs most of the time

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,799
do i need to configure it in each

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:14,000
codespace instance

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:16,480
yeah so it's specific to each repo i

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,280
am not able to answer if we're looking

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,760
into

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,039
doing it across different repos so that

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,280
like to save you time

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,120
in terms of like across organization

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,840
right now what it is it's specific to

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,880
repo

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,919
so if you had the same configuration um

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,159
then you you need to be uh basically

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,559
copying it over to a different one

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,840
uh just because a lot of times you do

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,400
want something different

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,520
in a different repository right and it's

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,360
easy enough to

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,600
basically bring in the same

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,159
configuration the dot files

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,200
are across the entire thing so my dot

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,240
files from

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,919
github basically are on persistent

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,919
across all of my code spaces

00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,760
i see do you have any other questions

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,200
you want to chime in trader

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,000
do you want to talk over it yeah for

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,279
sure yeah i waited this time i was

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,240
waiting for the gap waiting for you to

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,919
kind of punt it over

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,279
um so with the dot file so i've heard

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,279
about them for quite some time i've

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,279
continued to kick the can down the road

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,880
can you explain the transition from not

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:19,520
using dot files to using dot files

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,120
yeah so i don't think i even take full

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,360
advantage of them myself

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,799
right but you can configure certain

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,440
things that you like

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,080
um and then they will basically just

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,880
happen

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,240
across all of your repositories right so

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,600
you don't have to keep

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,240
um reconfiguring the same environment um

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,440
over and over so as a for instance that

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,080
terminal prompt

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,200
like i i used to actually every single

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,080
computer that i get

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,960
i used to um you know set up the

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,720
terminal prompt

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,360
exactly the way i like it now i don't

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,360
have to do that

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,559
cool so is that like a 20 minute kind of

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,919
transition or does it take a little bit

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,960
more time and effort to make the switch

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,440
so i think

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,600
you know it especially if it's all open

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,480
source so if you copy over and fork it

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,240
from somebody

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,679
um you can get started really really

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,520
quickly

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,000
cool i think that is what i am going to

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,440
do to get

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,120
started i'm not going to i'm just going

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,120
to take another person's help

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,480
we have one we have some other questions

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,320
coming in sasha

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,559
um this mr marker mark rocco says sasha

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,600
thank you so much for the presentation

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:31,360
question can i run two instances of the

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,640
editor connected

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,200
using the same container for example

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,880
can i speak up can i spin up a restful

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,000
api back end in one

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,880
instance and front end in another

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,159
but kind of connected so i can debug

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,919
both the front end

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,919
and the back end at the same time it's

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,840
excellent question

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,960
so it is an excellent question i don't

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,000
have an answer to that

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,880
uh but alison um who was in

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,440
the uh keynote today is also answering

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,240
the question

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,679
in the discussion so um she might be

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,679
able to answer that question for you

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,520
that would be awesome if we could get

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,400
that to happen

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,559
yes before i step over you again do you

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,559
have any other questions

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,919
yeah yeah so it seems that code spaces

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,000
is going to be absolutely

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,679
simple to use on the kind of consumer

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,279
side of things um but what's it like

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,279
setting up the configuration is that

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,600
that pretty simple require a little bit

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,120
more

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:31,919
of expertise yeah so did you see me like

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,039
i i could get started right away from

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,360
nothing at all so

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,039
it as long as you get access to it you

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,840
can get started by simply clicking a

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,480
button

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,320
now if you want to figure out something

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,279
quote unquote smarter to do with the

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,000
code space and

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,559
and have your specific configuration set

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,430
up then

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,000
probably you need to read the docs

00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:53,360
[Music]

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,120
cool back to you emoji okay and where

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,000
can we sign up for beta again

00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,840
where can we sign up for the beta yes so

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,760
maybe that's a good idea

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:06,799
to um have these links so the first link

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,200
um is where you can say request early

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,200
access

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,840
thank you so much yes so everybody you

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,720
can see where you can sign up for the

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,279
beta

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,640
um i'm gonna go use code spaces it's

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,640
like you know it's fun it's like a dream

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,640
come true so thank you to everybody at

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,640
the team who made this happen

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,159
and that is the end of our q a and

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,159
remember she's gonna continue in

00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,840
