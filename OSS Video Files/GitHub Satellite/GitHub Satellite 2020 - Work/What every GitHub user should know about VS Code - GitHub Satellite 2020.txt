Over the past year, VS Code has been hard at work delivering tighter and more seamless integration with GitHub. From viewing diffs and commit history, to managing PRs and conducting code reviews to creating issues - VS Code has re-imagined what it means to "code" when GitHub is a fundamental part of the experience. In this session, we'll take a look at the features and extensions for VS Code that might change the way you think.

GitHub Satellite: A community connected by code

On May 6th, we threw a free virtual event featuring developers working together on the world’s software, announcements from the GitHub team, and inspiring performances by artists who code.

I'd like to give you the pleasure of

00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:07,350
introducing how to's Degas well thank

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,059
you now straight off the bat we've got a

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,309
two-for-one special here not one speaker

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:13,049
but two our first speaker is coming all

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,330
the way from beautiful New Jersey and

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:17,369
she went to Georgia Tech which I did too

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,890
so I mean we know she's amazing our

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:22,529
second speaker comes from supposedly the

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,529
best city in the world Nashville

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:28,080
Tennessee the name of this next session

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:30,599
is what every github user should know

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,840
about D s code so without further ado

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,710
please help me welcome Sanaa Ajani and

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,710
Bourke Holland

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,020
[Music]

00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:53,360
Hey wow that was quite the introduction

00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:55,670
welcome everybody on this fine lovely

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,899
Wednesday evening or morning actually

00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,320
wherever you are we're all over the

00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:59,149
world

00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,269
my name is Burke Holland and I'm here

00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:04,129
with my colleague yes Anna hey Johnny

00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:05,930
hey everyone I'm Sena and together with

00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:08,119
Burke we both work at Microsoft where

00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,740
the s code gets built we're gonna spend

00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:11,659
the next 30 minutes talking to you about

00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,550
how you can improve your github life

00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:15,350
with the S code we're gonna show you

00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,479
some of the latest cutting-edge features

00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,820
in the editor and if you don't use vs

00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:21,440
code stick around some of the pain

00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,850
points that we talked about might still

00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,649
resonate with you and at least you'll

00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,410
know what BS code can do about them

00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:29,600
besides all developers and editors are

00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:34,460
welcome here so this is what every

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,320
github user should know about vs code so

00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,880
when we work on vs code we are always

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,369
thinking about developers developers

00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,050
developers developers more and more we

00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:43,429
know that github has become the

00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,140
bread-and-butter of workflows of

00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:46,460
developers all across the world

00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,560
you can't talk about improving

00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,450
development processes without thinking

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,579
about github it's not just how people

00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,780
build and test their code but it's also

00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:56,509
how they collaborate and communicate

00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,579
with each other so as we build vs code

00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:01,340
we're always taking in community input

00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:03,829
because we want vs code to work the way

00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,360
that developers work so over the last

00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:06,950
couple months Burke and I had reached

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,239
out to a bunch of developers and we

00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:12,890
asked them how do you use github so when

00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:14,390
we talk to these developers we wanted to

00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,489
know how they work in their repos and

00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,829
how they communicate with each other we

00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:20,660
heard a lot of common pain points so we

00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:22,400
heard people say things like it's really

00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,650
easy for me to forget about issues that

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,290
have been assigned to me or things like

00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,549
I forget about pull requests because of

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,410
the conversation that goes on in the

00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:33,109
comments and so pull requests are never

00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,850
merged or just forgotten about this

00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:36,440
would lead to you know code reviews not

00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:39,019
having as much participation or

00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,209
involvement as as you want we also heard

00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:43,609
from users that during code review they

00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:45,980
normally just check the the glance at

00:02:43,609 --> 00:02:48,470
the code and then merge it if the test

00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,060
pasts but sometimes they really want to

00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,010
test the code for themselves but the

00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,959
whole process of checking out adding a

00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,359
remote doing a git fetch can get really

00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,190
cumbersome and finally we heard from

00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:58,460
people that sometimes there's just too

00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,870
much

00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,430
context switching you have a bunch of

00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,590
windows open with all your different

00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,270
tabs and notifications you have a bunch

00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,420
of terminals open and a bunch of editors

00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:10,040
so that can become really overwhelming

00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,560
so we learned that there isn't really a

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,600
correct git or github workflow every

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,550
developer every development team uses a

00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,290
different workflow and there is a bunch

00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,930
of different reasons that that's that's

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:23,510
totally okay so what we want to do is

00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:25,250
see if we can still tackle some of these

00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,920
common pain points that we heard inside

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,930
the editor so when we think about where

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,060
developers spend a lot of their time you

00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,040
can kind of divide it into two loops one

00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,350
is the inner development loop this is

00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,450
where the code lives so things like

00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,770
where you edit your code where you debug

00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:42,020
your code where you navigate through

00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,790
your code the other is the outer loop

00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,440
this is all the things that have been

00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,360
outside the editor so things like

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,880
project management and documentation

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,920
setting up your CI CD all the stuff

00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,410
that's happening on github so both of

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,030
these loops have to exist but the more

00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,140
disconnected they are the more context

00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,900
switching that you're doing as a

00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:02,030
developer so we asked ourselves can we

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,010
bring these two loops closer together if

00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,260
we bring some of the experiences from

00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,420
the outer dev loop can we bring them and

00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,830
connect them into the inner loop if we

00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,330
can do that we'll reduce the amount of

00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,970
jumping around that developers are doing

00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:16,460
and this way you save more time to be

00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,140
focused and be more productive but with

00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:20,090
that said if we're bringing in things

00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,860
into vs code like code reviews and

00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,920
collaboration we have to make sure that

00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:26,750
it's usable usable by all developers so

00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,460
we have to make sure it's flexible and

00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:31,490
customizable depending on what your

00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,720
team's workflow is so what's what Burke

00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,700
is going to show you now for the first

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,410
time is what we've been working on in vs

00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:41,930
code for the past couple months to bring

00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:44,000
github closer to you and vs code all

00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,430
right Thank You Sona well we've actually

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,920
been working on two things for the past

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:52,640
few months that are designed to improve

00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,140
the experience for github users the NBS

00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,000
code one of the things we've been

00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,760
working on it's of course the editor

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,920
itself but Visual Studio code isn't

00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,320
super opinionated about which source

00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,630
control provider you use it tries to be

00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,860
as agnostic about that as possible so

00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,770
that you can use the source control

00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,690
provider that works best for you but

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,320
we've have made some improvements to vs

00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,780
code

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,890
specifically around authentication that

00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,290
allow us to do some pretty cool things

00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:19,400
with it with extensions and so the other

00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,010
thing we're gonna show you is an

00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,470
extension called github pull requests

00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:27,020
and issues formerly known as github pull

00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:29,660
requests and there's been quite a bit of

00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,340
functionality added in there but of

00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,170
course it's one thing to talk about it

00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,090
it's quite another to see it in action

00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,740
so let's do that now

00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:39,430
so I'm going to go ahead and show you my

00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,430
screen here

00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,570
uh son uh could you go ahead and stop

00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,840
sharing so I could

00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,560
I don't sorry about that oh that's okay

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:58,140
no problem

00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:00,600
all right Oh perfect that's perfect okay

00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:03,030
so I'm use I've got Visual Studio code

00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,820
open here and I'm using the insiders

00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:07,500
Edition which is the nightly build this

00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,330
is the latest bits we're gonna be

00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,620
showing you some cutting-edge features

00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,290
here so we're gonna need the latest

00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,000
build of this now before we do anything

00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,190
else let's just get this out of the way

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,570
the theme that I'm using here which is

00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:21,660
probably the most important question to

00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:23,310
be asked is the github theme there's an

00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,170
official github theme that you can

00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,120
install you'll know it's the right one

00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:28,800
cuz it says it's made by github it's

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,430
right here I like it a lot I think it's

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,400
really nice

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:34,470
alright now by default in Visual Studio

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,590
code we have this source control of you

00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:40,770
and if you use visuals - Visual Studio

00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:43,710
code before you recognize this view here

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:46,170
and this initialize repository button if

00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:48,000
I click this in this project it will

00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:50,850
essentially run in a get in it and then

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,770
I'll have a local repository alized but

00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,840
we've added this authentication provider

00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:58,530
inside a visual studio code that allows

00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,420
us to authenticate to services and then

00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,430
extensions can use that authentication

00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,800
to provide a much more expanded

00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,410
experience so let's do this let's

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,160
install the github pull requests and

00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:13,350
issues extension which is here I'm going

00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,290
to go ahead and install this and it's

00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:18,030
installed and now when we go back to the

00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:20,280
source control view there's a new button

00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,770
and it says publish to github but what

00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,870
are what happens if we click on that it

00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,610
asks us to sign in this is the new

00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,040
authentication provider kicking in so

00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,690
we're gonna say allow and then say

00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,220
continue and just like that we've

00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,900
authenticated to github

00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,120
now if you've used villa's code before

00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,890
you know that before you had to create a

00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,210
get a private access token and give that

00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,830
to the extension you have to do any of

00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,810
that anymore all of that can now be

00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,040
handled by the provider and you can see

00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,590
here that I can actually for the first

00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,930
time create a repository from Visual

00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:51,270
Studio code so if I click create private

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:53,250
repository will do just that and put my

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,780
code there but I don't want to do that

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,120
what I want to do actually is clone a

00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,919
project instead so

00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,570
you might be using to use to cloning

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,490
from the terminal you can also clone

00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:04,400
from inside a visual studio code which

00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:07,639
is not new but what is new is this clone

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,280
from github action if I click on this I

00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:13,070
can clone repositories from github which

00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,169
repositories any repository that I can

00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:17,240
have access to so for instance let's say

00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:19,100
I wanted to clone the react project from

00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,110
Facebook I just need to know enough

00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,790
about the name of the repository to

00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:25,040
search for it and boom there it is

00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:27,590
I can clone it right from here but the

00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,030
one we're gonna clone is called with the

00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,160
URL s this is a project we've been

00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:32,779
working on and we're gonna clone B

00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:37,099
front-end project here so we'll select

00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:41,770
ok and find a spot for it here let's put

00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:44,870
it let's put it here in this folder

00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:49,310
sounds good and then it's gonna clone it

00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:50,720
and I'm gonna say open in new window now

00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,400
you'll notice if we click on this

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,560
provider over here that I'm now signed

00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,630
into github and if I click on this I can

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,820
actually say manage trusted extensions

00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:01,580
and I can say which extensions have

00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,440
access to this authentication for github

00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:06,650
to make sure that the wrong extensions

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,850
don't get access so when I did this let

00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,500
me go ahead and open the terminal it's

00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,750
20/20 so the first thing we have to do

00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,040
in any project is run an NPM install so

00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,230
let's go ahead and get that out of the

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:19,100
way but I want to show you some of

00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:20,810
what's happened here if I look at bigot

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,060
remotes here so let's look at our get

00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:25,580
remotes you'll see that we cloned over

00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,990
HTTP visual studio code did that and it

00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,520
never asked us for a username or

00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,300
password because it's handling all of

00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:34,040
that with the authentication provider

00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,140
additionally if we push or pull from

00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,330
visual studio code or from the internal

00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,800
terminal here we won't get prompted for

00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:42,440
username or password everything will

00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,480
just work so if you don't have SSH keys

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,390
set up visual studio code will handle

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,860
all of that for you over HTTPS so let's

00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,750
go ahead and look at this application

00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,610
that we're actually working on here the

00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,770
application is called the URL lists and

00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,180
what it allows us to do is to collect a

00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,970
list of links that we want to send to

00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:01,370
people maybe one of them is this one of

00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,930
course there's this one right here and

00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,370
the last one I don't know why we would

00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:06,860
ever send someone a list to just

00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:09,920
Facebook but there it is and then we can

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,600
publish this and we get a vanity URL

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,459
we can send to people and then they can

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,310
see all of the links so it's just a list

00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:18,380
of links and of course a giant QR code

00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:20,149
because again it's 2020 you're gonna

00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,190
want that giant QR code we want you to

00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:25,190
have it all right so back on this home

00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:27,230
page here I like this page I've got this

00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:30,470
very minimalistic design which is great

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:32,180
but it's a little too minimal I feel

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,279
like we need a description here and so I

00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:36,290
want to get Sunna to add a description

00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:37,760
because I know that she works on this

00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,430
part of the site because this is how our

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,170
team works so I want to show you how we

00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:44,690
sort of brought that outer loop of

00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:47,360
github closer to the inner loop of where

00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:49,970
your code is so I'm gonna open up the

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,860
home dot view file here and what I want

00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:53,990
to do is I know that underneath this

00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,120
banner text is where I want this

00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:58,130
description to go so actually I can

00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,610
actually highlight this and I could say

00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:03,050
create issue from selection and then

00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:07,670
I'll give it a description so I'll say

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:10,040
add a site description and then if I

00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:13,220
click on this little pencil icon I get

00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,720
an editor where I can edit the issue and

00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,970
then you can see it's a markdown file

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,880
and it's given me a permalink to the

00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:22,550
lines that I just highlighted so that's

00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,290
one way that we could do this but one of

00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,149
the things that we do a lot on our team

00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,589
is we work in the master branch because

00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:29,510
we don't build from there and so we

00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:31,339
leave a lot of - dues for each other so

00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:33,290
a lot of times we'll just leave comments

00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:36,680
and you're like add a site description

00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:38,720
this is just how our workflow works but

00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,029
what's new here because of the github

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,410
pull request in inches extension I can

00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:44,600
actually mention sunna

00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,850
directly from here and you can see it's

00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,890
pulling her presence in from github as

00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,890
well as the other contributors on this

00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:53,750
repository so I'm gonna select that but

00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:56,029
now watch this if I come over here and

00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,920
say - do I get this little light bulb

00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:00,709
over here and it says if I click on it

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,079
it says create github issue and it

00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:04,940
automatically populates the title and if

00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:06,800
I hit the pencil it gives me the

00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:10,850
permalink but I'm going to take this out

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:14,959
and I'm just gonna say add you add a

00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:16,130
description - home dot view this is

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,420
gonna give her a little bit of

00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,340
information so she doesn't have to go

00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,830
searching for the file

00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:25,040
and then I'm gonna go ahead and click

00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:27,410
this which will create this issue in

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,630
github and pop us back over and you can

00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:32,480
see it added the issue number in line

00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:34,370
and if I mouse over that it shows me the

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,720
details of the issue right here inside

00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:38,750
of the editor this is the outer loop

00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,040
literally inside of the editor and of

00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:43,040
course if I mouse over sauna

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,510
here I can see all of her information so

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,730
I want to go ahead and commit this file

00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:49,700
here so I'm gonna go ahead and save and

00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:52,870
I'm going to stage this file and then

00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:56,240
I'm just gonna say add site description

00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:58,730
comment and then and watch this because

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,560
it's Visual Studio code and because of

00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:02,360
the extension I can mention sauna here

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,090
as well so we just have presents

00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,470
throughout the editor which is great I'm

00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:08,270
going to go ahead and stage this and

00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,970
then I'm going to go ahead and

00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:12,260
synchronize down here in the status bar

00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:15,110
I just click down here in the left hand

00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:17,420
corner and all of this is done over HTTP

00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,070
and just like that I've created an issue

00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,320
and so now I'm going to turn it back

00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:24,050
over to sauna to show you what this

00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:27,470
looks like on the other side of this

00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:29,150
equation sauna all right all right cool

00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:31,210
so let me show you when my screen looks

00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,210
like

00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:43,150
all right so you can see envious code I

00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:44,230
have a first thing I'm going to do is

00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:47,440
I'm going to go over to the source

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:49,150
control view and I will do a git pull so

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,590
I can do that multiple ways in vs code

00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:54,160
I'm gonna do it from the context menu

00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:57,400
over here and now you can see I'm

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,290
totally on the master branch so I'm

00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,450
going to go over to the sort of the

00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:04,060
github pull request extension view and I

00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:08,110
can see this issues section as a part of

00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:10,150
this view by default vs code will create

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,760
two sections here called my issues and

00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:15,040
created issues my issues are issues that

00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,360
have been assigned to me and then it

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,640
created issues are the ones that I've

00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,430
created so the cool part about this is

00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,320
that you can edit this to be specific to

00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:25,510
whatever you want to do so if you have

00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,910
labels and milestones and that's how you

00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:29,350
organize issues and manage your project

00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,330
you can you can work with that

00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:33,400
so if I click on this it opens up my

00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,720
settings a JSON and you can see that

00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,750
there's a setting to create additional

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:42,100
queries so I can go ahead and create a

00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:44,890
new one and say like label and I'm going

00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:48,010
to call it all issues and then go ahead

00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:50,380
and add a query and this will show up so

00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:53,080
you can query this the same way you

00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:55,750
would on github.com so I'm gonna do is

00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,180
go ahead and change the the query here

00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:01,180
I'm gonna copy this and say I want it to

00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:04,760
be in this repo all open issues and all

00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:06,820
the ones that are assigned to me

00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,820
you

00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,350
cool and that gets rid of the milestone

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,300
because our team doesn't really use

00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,700
milestones so now I can customize this

00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,680
the way I want so now I'm on the master

00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,839
branch but as soon as I click over this

00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,880
issue and hover over it I get the hover

00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,310
information and I can start working on

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,260
the issue so when I start started

00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:27,060
working on that you saw that down here I

00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:29,790
switched from the master branch and we

00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:32,310
checked out a new issue branch so now I

00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:34,230
can go over to home W because I see that

00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:36,269
that's where Burke wants me to add it

00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:38,579
and I can see the same issue that he

00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:41,459
just added so same thing hover over see

00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:42,899
the issue description and I think this

00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:44,399
is a pretty simple thing so let's go

00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:47,820
ahead and remove the to do comment and

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,680
I'm going to add and I already have the

00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,500
you know the instructions that I want to

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,440
add here I'll copy this over and then

00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,850
paste it right in here alright looks

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,160
good that was a pretty simple change

00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,480
added some instructions so let's go

00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,029
ahead go ahead and go source control

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,279
view and commit this so you see that now

00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:07,140
vs code picked up on the fact that I

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,329
started working on the issue and added a

00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:11,430
commit message for me it's the name of

00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:13,050
the issue and it's the issue number so

00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,720
this is great exactly what I want

00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:19,700
commit this and I can go down to the

00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,700
status bar and also push this

00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:28,179
all right cool so one thing I want to

00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:30,279
show real quick is also some other

00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:32,559
settings that you have so with the

00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:34,360
issues you can customize it even more so

00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,490
you saw that Burke when he created the

00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,920
to do common it created an issue trigger

00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:41,350
if you want to use other keywords to do

00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,939
so you can add that right here you also

00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,829
saw that when we started working on the

00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:46,420
issue it created a new branch but if

00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:47,559
that's not something your team does or

00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,019
you don't want to create that many

00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:53,379
branches you can just turn this off you

00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:55,149
also saw that the commit message when I

00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:57,100
started working on it was in this format

00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:59,199
the name of the issue and what it fit

00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,119
what it fixes so you can customize this

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,249
issue commit message to be whatever you

00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:06,520
want so now that I've committed it I'm

00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:07,959
gonna go in and change the issue into a

00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,909
claw request so I can click in the

00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:11,949
status bar and I get a couple options I

00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:14,439
get an option to create a pull request

00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:16,569
or a draft pull request we've heard from

00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:18,490
developers that they use both a draft

00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:20,589
full request is a polar quest that's not

00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,760
yet ready to be reviewed but I think

00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,049
this is a pretty simple change it's

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,179
pretty ready so I'll just create a pull

00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:27,490
request from this target the master

00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:31,570
branch and let's use the commit message

00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:32,980
as the name of the PR and you can see

00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:36,730
I'm brought over to the pull request

00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:38,710
view and I can go in and see the files

00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,740
I've changed the commitment the commits

00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:43,360
I've I've done and I see the same sort

00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:46,090
of view for the PR that I would on

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,429
github.com so this is a pretty simple

00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:52,409
fix all just add Burke as a reviewer so

00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:52,409
he can go in and approve my PR

00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,589
you

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,589
[Music]

00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,610
you

00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,370
you

00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:20,440
all right so we're back in my screen now

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,990
and over here I've got my sidebar on the

00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,370
right hand side so let me just go ahead

00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:26,650
and get that out of the way as well and

00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:30,580
say that I toggle the sidebar from the

00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:32,050
left to the right because it's better on

00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:35,320
the right and the reason for that is

00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:37,690
because if it's on the left when you

00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,190
collapse it watch the code it jumps or

00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,380
if you put it on the right

00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:43,330
watch the code it doesn't jump around

00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,980
anymore I don't see the session was

00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,240
worth it just for that all right but let

00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,970
me show you here on the side here we've

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,380
got the pull requests and issues it's

00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,540
everything is now right here within

00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,850
visual studio code so it's easier for me

00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,890
to take accountability for things that I

00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,540
need to do one of the things that I know

00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:00,130
as a developer is when it's on github is

00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,750
sort of out of sight out of mind and

00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:03,610
it's easy for me to ignore it and

00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,020
pretend like it's not happening and

00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,850
there's not a bunch of stuff for me to

00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,860
do there which is something I'm just

00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:11,470
very guilty of so I'm going to look at

00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:13,600
the pull request here that Senna has

00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,670
submitted and marked me for review on

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,000
and I can see it just like it would be

00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:20,710
on github and I want to go ahead and

00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,350
view the diff so I'm just gonna click on

00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,600
the file I can see that side by side by

00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:28,030
the way little tip if you'd like to see

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,070
the unified diff just do the toggle the

00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:32,080
in-line view and that will give you the

00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,160
inline diff view that's pretty simple

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,930
change it looks fine

00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,490
but of course we don't want to run this

00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:38,170
without checking it out and see if it

00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,910
works locally so I'm gonna come over

00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:41,800
here and I'm just going to click

00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:44,080
checkout and what that's going to do is

00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,420
move me from the master branch over to

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,790
the PR branch that son are created and

00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,740
I'm already running this site down here

00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,970
so I'm just gonna click here and let's

00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,770
load it up and see what it looks like

00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:55,510
it's beautiful I love it

00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:57,670
this is poetic I could not have done it

00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:00,070
any better myself this is the best

00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:03,430
change ever all right so I definitely

00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:05,500
want to merge this it looks great so

00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:09,250
what I'm gonna do here is I'm going to

00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:12,780
go ahead and just leave a comment once I

00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:14,940
collapse my terminal here let's

00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,530
go down and leave a comment so I'm just

00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:22,820
gonna say this looks good to me

00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:22,820
and approve this and

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:30,290
gonna say up here I'm gonna exit review

00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:31,760
mode that puts me back on master in the

00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:35,690
bottom left-hand corner and then I'm

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,280
gonna say merge pull request and create

00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,950
a merge commit it's just like you would

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,510
on github.com now once I've done this it

00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,310
can say delete branch but watch this

00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,990
because we're inside a visual studio

00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:46,820
code it knows a little bit more about

00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:48,620
our code like the fact that we have a

00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,350
local branch so we can go ahead and

00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:53,960
delete that as well and that's the

00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:56,000
completed workflow so we've now done the

00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:59,150
entire workflow of identifying an issue

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,130
creating it seeing it parsing it fixing

00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:03,830
it the pull request closing the pull

00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:06,590
request all from inside of the editor

00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:08,870
here now one of the other things we

00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:11,630
heard from people is that that add their

00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:14,840
workflow is very unique we heard that a

00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:16,490
lot and we concur there's not one right

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,680
way to use github there's only the way

00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:20,930
that your team uses it so we wanted to

00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,510
do is make things very customizable up

00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:25,400
to and including the editor itself so we

00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:27,170
have this nice Timeline view here that's

00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,670
in the Explorer that's been added but

00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:31,220
you might want this over where your

00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:34,610
github stuff is so if you just drag this

00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:37,460
over and hover over that extension you

00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:39,110
can just drop it right here and all of

00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,460
the editors like that so if we open the

00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,290
terminal for instance on let's say I

00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:44,810
just wanted to put all of the output

00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:47,510
there as well we can do that too I mean

00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:52,460
the editor is yours customize it to the

00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:55,060
way that works the best for you with

00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:58,850
that we want to bring it full circle and

00:21:55,060 --> 00:22:02,780
give you your very own URL s that has

00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:05,180
all of the resources that you need to

00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:08,510
get up and running with github from this

00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:11,480
talk envyus code so thank you so much

00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:14,090
for joining us for this session and

00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:26,690
we'll be hanging around to answer all of

00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:28,610
your questions yes thank you all the

00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:30,380
amazing integrations happening is the s

00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:33,080
coding get up I've just started using

00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:36,470
this code so I love the way you included

00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:38,450
all the github stuff so it's very

00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:39,740
very exciting to say now never gonna be

00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:42,650
questions coming and we have time for

00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:43,850
just one question Jared would you like

00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:46,460
to hit us with one of the questions

00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:48,049
coming from discussions yes we have a

00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:50,150
ton coming in we only have time for one

00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:52,789
but the one question we can ask is what

00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:54,640
else is on the vs code roadmap that'll

00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:57,260
be coming soon

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,059
yeah we've got some super exciting stuff

00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,950
coming so one of the things that Burke

00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:02,059
was showing the detachable parts that's

00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,650
something that our team's been working

00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:05,000
on for a while and that's a really

00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,510
exciting feature to customize your

00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,450
editor

00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:10,010
speaking of customization another thing

00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:13,130
that we're working on is custom editors

00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:15,080
so this is in place of vs code standard

00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:17,080
text editor so if you're working with

00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,970
things like binary files or data files

00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:22,130
you can now use like an image editor for

00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:23,990
instance or a way to visually render

00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:26,840
those so that's an exciting thing coming

00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:28,850
up and one more I'll do one more is a

00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,130
notebook native notebook experience in

00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:32,900
BS code so we've noticed that notebooks

00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,909
like Jupiter have become super popular

00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:37,970
in data science and even the education

00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:40,460
space so now we're working on a native

00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:49,400
rich notebook experience inside vs code

00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:51,950
from from just out of the box start to

00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,750
be working for day now I know we don't
