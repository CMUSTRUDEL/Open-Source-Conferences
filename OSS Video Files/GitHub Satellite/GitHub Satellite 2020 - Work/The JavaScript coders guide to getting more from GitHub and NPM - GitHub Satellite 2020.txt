Title: The JavaScript coders guide to getting more from GitHub and NPM - GitHub Satellite 2020
Publication date: 2020-05-07
Playlist: GitHub Satellite 2020 - Work
Description: 
	Presented by Ed Thomson, GitHub

In this session, we'll talk through the implications of NPM joining the GitHub family for JavaScript developers, and how to get the best out of GitHub for both your open source work as well as your work inside your organization. 

GitHub Satellite: A community connected by code

On May 6th, we threw a free virtual event featuring developers working together on the worldâ€™s software, announcements from the GitHub team, and inspiring performances by artists who code.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
next well so the gentleman that's

00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,919
joining us next is actually we've been

00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,019
buddies for gosh 15 years now we did a

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,630
we were in a start-up together and then

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,969
got bought by Microsoft and then he went

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,770
over to github and then you know we will

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:18,720
get home and now he's back in and then

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,670
you know that was all good so then I I

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,500
been left Microsoft and joined there

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,990
that get home so anyway I've kind of

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,810
spoiled the surprise so ya know we've

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,310
got thousands coming up next for Edwin

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,500
Thompson he's going to be talking to us

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,960
about another acquisition that's been

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,760
happening actually it's the JavaScript

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,110
code is going to get a little bit NPM is

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,180
what we're going to talk about so he's

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,879
going to take us through you know the

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,110
NPM team them joining github and what

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,700
that means and kind of what the the

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,110
future is firm yeah

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,180
now that it's part of the guild family

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,460
so really excited to this session really

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,770
excited to talk to Ed afterwards so

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,000
we'll let's go get started with this

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,000
session so over to you Ed

00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,350
[Applause]

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,350
[Music]

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,960
hi everybody thanks so much for joining

00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:14,560
me here at github satellite the virtual

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:17,710
Edition this year I'd be lying if I said

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,540
I don't want to you know be meeting you

00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:22,270
face-to-face and talking to you directly

00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,560
about the projects that you're building

00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,930
and about the packages that you're

00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,200
publishing NPM obviously we can't do

00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:31,600
that this year so I'm really happy that

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,300
github has been able to keep us healthy

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,410
and safe together and that you've

00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:39,910
decided to join us virtually this year

00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:42,700
my name is Everett Thompson I'm a

00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:46,870
product manager at github and I work on

00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:50,260
NPM and if that doesn't entirely make

00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:52,990
sense why is there a product manager at

00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:56,800
github working on NPM well it turns out

00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:59,320
that NPM has been acquired by github so

00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,110
we announced earlier this year in March

00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,540
that the github was going to acquire NPM

00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:07,210
Inc and then a few weeks ago we actually

00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:12,250
completed the acquisition in mid-april

00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:14,890
so now NPM is a part of github and here

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:18,370
at github we're extremely excited about

00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:22,150
this in particular because NPM is such a

00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:24,220
great fit as part of github just like

00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:27,340
github stores the world's open source

00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:31,239
software NPM packages it and delivers it

00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:33,640
and that's not going to change we're

00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,560
going to continue to invest in NPM and

00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,470
continue to improve it because the

00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:42,700
entire JavaScript ecosystem relies upon

00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:45,180
NPM and in the year 2020 that's a huge

00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:48,850
portion of the development ecosystem

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,010
because almost every single web app uses

00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,709
JavaScript on the front end many of them

00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,750
use javascript on the back end and you

00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:58,300
know many desktop apps are even built in

00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:00,130
JavaScript like vs code and and slack

00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,970
the things that we use on a day to day

00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:08,860
basis and all of those applications rely

00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:10,420
on NPM when I think of the NPM product I

00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,150
think of it in two parts

00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:15,700
first there's the NPM CLI and that's

00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,010
what most of us are used to interacting

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,060
with on a day to day basis after we've

00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,550
cloned our

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,290
worries down from github we run npm

00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,810
install to actually install our

00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,310
dependencies and like most of my

00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,700
projects were actually typescript so i

00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:33,040
run npm run build to transpile that

00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,380
typescript into javascript and then I

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,980
run NPM tests actually test my

00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:40,989
application so I think that when many of

00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:46,569
us think about NPM we think about the

00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:50,110
actual NPM CLI but in fact NPM is a lot

00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:52,569
more than just that there's also the NPM

00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:57,940
registry and that's where all those

00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:59,560
packages live that NPM fetches and it

00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,380
turns out that not every developer

00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,150
actually uses NPM on the command line

00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,849
you might use a different package

00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:10,120
manager like ER and that's another great

00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:13,000
tool but whatever you use whether it's

00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,510
NPM or yarn you're actually still

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,829
downloading those packages from the NPM

00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:23,320
registry so to suggest that the NPM

00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:24,220
registry is important is an

00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,060
understatement

00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:33,130
it's actually an absolutely critical

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:35,919
piece of structure it turns out that it

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:39,550
contains just about one and a quarter

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:42,669
million packages now this is everything

00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:44,770
from the critical packages that make up

00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:48,850
modern software development things like

00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:50,800
lodash Express and react and it also

00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:53,200
ends up being things like the silly

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,810
applications that I write that I build

00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,870
and publish like a little library for

00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:01,479
doing complex arithmetic all of these

00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:04,060
packages live in the NPM registry and

00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:08,260
they're available every time you run npm

00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:11,020
install last week there were over 20

00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:14,740
million i'm sorry there are over 20

00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:16,419
billion downloads of packages so this is

00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,000
every time somebody downloads a project

00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:20,919
and runs npm install or every time

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,210
somebody does a CI build on github

00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:26,680
actions and runs npm CI i think like one

00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:29,890
or two of these downloads might even be

00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,840
packages that i built and as an app

00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:35,660
mention it mentioned in his keynote

00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:40,850
last month there were over 84 billion

00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:43,940
downloads of packages now we often call

00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:47,060
these things vanity metrics and when you

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:49,190
do that I think that's okay but you

00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,620
might minimize these numbers because

00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:55,220
each of these almost 85 billion

00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,580
downloads has to succeed and if it

00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,960
doesn't you can't do your development

00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:03,110
each of these downloads has to succeed

00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,330
or you can't do a deployment and so it's

00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:10,040
absolutely crucial that the NPM registry

00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:13,100
is fast stable and available to you as a

00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:16,040
JavaScript developer and so we're going

00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:19,070
to continue to invest in NPM to make

00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:23,330
sure that your downloads keep working

00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:25,520
and so yes we're going to continue work

00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:27,050
on this critical invisible

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,900
infrastructure of software development

00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:32,210
but we're not only going to work on the

00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,340
infrastructure we're also going to work

00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:37,160
on new features and new functionality

00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:41,830
and we're gonna do that in both parts of

00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:44,240
NPM both the CLI and in the registry so

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:47,270
since it's the thing that we interact

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,240
with most or at least most obviously I

00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:54,080
want to talk about the NPM CLI first so

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,360
right now the team is working on NPM v7

00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,110
and that's the next version of the CLI

00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:02,900
and it's actually a really big shift the

00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:05,030
CLI team is doing some major refactoring

00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,880
they're improving correctness and

00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:09,800
performance they're helping secure your

00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,539
software better and they're trying to

00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,050
improve compatibility with the other

00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:17,360
tools in the ecosystem now I was

00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:21,470
actually able to get a sneak peek of

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:24,440
what's coming in in NPM v7 it turns out

00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:29,690
I just cloned the the repo because the

00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:31,039
NPM CLI is open-source so they've shared

00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:34,190
that with me and I'm actually able to

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:38,930
take a look so I'm able to show you as

00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:41,180
well so one of the things that the NPM

00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:43,760
CLI team is improving is the experience

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,420
around NPM audit and I think this is

00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,660
incredibly important you

00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:52,230
because NPM Aude it helps us secure our

00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:54,840
software better and so here I have a

00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:58,370
really simple package a really simple

00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,960
JavaScript project it has one dependency

00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,250
it turns out oh that this dependency is

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,740
a little bit old and now has some

00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:07,740
vulnerabilities so if I run NPM audit

00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:10,760
using the current version of NPM NPM v6

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:14,430
I can see exactly what it's doing and

00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:17,160
it'll take just a second and it finds

00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:20,610
well it tells me if it's found eighteen

00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,820
low severity vulnerabilities there it is

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,820
right there

00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:30,750
and I think that's helpful but there are

00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:33,850
actually some problems here for example

00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:37,860
there's a lot of noise like this tabular

00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:41,830
layout is really pretty but it's also

00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:43,000
really space inefficient it's taking up

00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:46,750
a lot of space just to tell me that

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,120
there's a simple problem in one package

00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:53,620
and that package is minimus minimus tis

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,630
a really popular package and so you

00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,630
actually see it a couple times in here

00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:01,000
because it turns out that the minimus

00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:04,210
package is used by other packages you

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,120
can see it's used by make turkey it's

00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:11,800
used up here again by make therapy it's

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,270
used down here by optimist and so the

00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,000
minimus package having a vulnerability

00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:20,680
means that I get this repeated over and

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,510
over again and that's fine it's really

00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:26,380
helpful that all this information is

00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:29,800
there but it would be more ideal if this

00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:32,110
were a little bit more concise if I

00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,330
could get the information about the

00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,880
security vulnerabilities and how to fix

00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:41,200
them as directly and quickly as

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:44,200
succinctly as possible so that's one of

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:49,100
the nice new changes in @pm v7

00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:51,529
so if I run NPM audit using NPM seven

00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:53,149
well the outputs a lot different I don't

00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:55,519
have that tabular layout anymore so it's

00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:59,709
not taking up as much space and you see

00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:03,110
that actually this is all it outputs

00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:05,060
this time it knows that minimis is the

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,100
vulnerable package and even though I

00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,410
have multiple things that I'm using the

00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:13,250
depend on it like make derpy and like

00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:15,110
optimist it doesn't have to repeat the

00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:17,839
information over and over again because

00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:21,620
it knows that if I just update minimis

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:23,480
all of these problems go away so I'm

00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,889
really excited about that change I think

00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,310
that it's going to be a really big help

00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:30,800
in understanding the vulnerabilities in

00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:36,350
our software packages and that lets us

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:38,410
fix them easier and quicker but while

00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,990
we're doing the

00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:43,480
with NPM on it we're also making some

00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:45,040
really interesting changes around the

00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,350
way it actually understands

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,589
vulnerabilities and how it can fix them

00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:53,350
so here's a package and if I look at my

00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:55,389
package JSON you can see that this is

00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:58,209
just a super simple project it depends

00:10:55,389 --> 00:11:02,110
on a single package make therapy and it

00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:04,540
depends on carat Oh dot 4.0 that's

00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:07,029
semantic versioning or semver meaning

00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:10,060
that we want make derpy o dot 4 dot o or

00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:11,470
any newer minor version we won't it

00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,699
automatically update to the major

00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,279
versions because those could have

00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:16,720
breaking changes and in fact make

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,879
therapy does have a breaking change in

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,910
version 1 it moved from a call back

00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:24,550
based approach in version 0 to using a

00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:27,040
promise to returning promises in version

00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:29,529
1 and although the promise API is

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,569
definitely better it's going to require

00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:33,699
refactoring your code where you call

00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:35,589
make syrupy so it's not something that

00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:39,970
just running npm install is going to get

00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:42,189
you now the problem is if there's a

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:45,480
security vulnerability in this version

00:11:42,189 --> 00:11:47,350
of make turkey and there isn't a

00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,439
vulnerability and make it repeat itself

00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:53,680
but in minimus if we look at our package

00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:56,589
lock JSON we can see that we're locked

00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:01,470
it makes our p o dot 4 dot 2 and we have

00:11:56,589 --> 00:12:07,990
minimus that make therapy depends on and

00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:10,209
if we run npm 6 audit what we see is

00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,800
that there is actually a vulnerability

00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:13,839
there's a vulnerability in this version

00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,019
of minimus and the version of make derpy

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:21,449
that we're using is ultimately

00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:24,339
vulnerable now npm 6 audit tells us that

00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:27,730
this vulnerability requires some ver

00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:30,610
major dependency updates it can't do

00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:34,360
this resolution automatically it asks us

00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,769
to update to make their p1 so we'd

00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,559
actually have to go and refactor our

00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:42,519
code and that makes sense

00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:45,490
but it's awfully frustrating the new

00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:50,199
audit functionality in NP mv7 if I run

00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:51,820
that it well it actually tells me that

00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:54,610
it can address all issues just by

00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:56,770
and p.m. audit fix and that's pretty

00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:59,470
surprising because NPM six definitely

00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:04,420
can't do that so what happens if I run

00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:07,090
NPM seven audit fix well it tells me

00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:10,240
that it changed one package and now as a

00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:12,070
result I have zero vulnerabilities so

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,620
what did it do did it just ignore that

00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:17,620
major version update let's take a look

00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,330
at the package lock JSON no it didn't it

00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:23,190
didn't update us to the major version it

00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:26,710
didn't break our cember it downgraded us

00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:31,420
so what it's actually done here is

00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:34,510
realized that in our package JSON we

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,670
have asked for 0.40 or anything newer

00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:40,060
that is semantically versioned

00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:42,280
acceptable and we were at ODOT 4.2 and

00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,410
instead of being able to upgrade us to

00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,770
fix that security vulnerability it can

00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:50,770
downgrade us so NPM audit has gotten a

00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:52,980
lot smarter and a lot more able to deal

00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:55,240
with fixing your vulnerabilities

00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:58,300
automatically I'm really excited about

00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:01,930
that one of the other things I'm really

00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:04,330
excited about is compatibility with

00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:06,730
other tools in the ecosystem like yarn

00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:08,770
here again I've got a super simple

00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:13,540
project this time I've got a package

00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:15,910
JSON and now I've got a yarn lock that

00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:19,660
indicates that people are using yarn in

00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:22,390
this project and usually if I were to

00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:24,550
come in as you know somebody new to the

00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:27,550
project and familiar with NPM and not

00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:31,450
yarn what I would do is run NPM install

00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:34,630
in this project and what happens is that

00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:39,130
actually NPM and yarn don't coexist very

00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:41,230
well so what's happened now is NPM has

00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:43,720
created a package lock JSON like you'd

00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:48,220
expect and it's installed make sure PE

00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:54,300
version 1.4 okay the problem with that

00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:56,400
though is that yarn is locked at 10.2 so

00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,510
at this point

00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,640
NPM has told me that I should commit

00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:03,070
this package lock JSON push it up and I

00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,649
will just break everybody because we've

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,499
got two different teams that

00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:09,509
team using NPM and a team using yarn

00:15:06,499 --> 00:15:12,449
using two different dependencies that's

00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:14,100
very very frustrating I can run this

00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:18,089
little reset script to start over and

00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:21,059
now I've gotten rid of the NPM package

00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:23,790
locked out JSON and I want to show you

00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:26,939
what NPM 7 does in this environment if I

00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:29,399
run NPM 7 install well I still get my

00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:34,050
package lock JSON except this time I'm

00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:36,329
pinned it make sure p1 dot o dot 2 now

00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,459
that's exactly what it should be that's

00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:40,470
what our yarn lock is using and so

00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:43,170
that's great

00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:46,350
we can see that our yarn lock is also in

00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:47,879
good shape now the other thing that can

00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:50,309
be problematic is when somebody tries to

00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:53,399
install a package a new package using

00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:55,470
NPM and so if I do that with NPM 7 let's

00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:58,350
say I install the brief package

00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:00,689
well again I end up with that in my

00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:04,889
package lock JSON you can see a brief

00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:07,470
version 1 1 1 and you know NPM and yarn

00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:08,999
kind of compete with each other so we

00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:11,850
sure wouldn't want to update the yarn

00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:13,410
lock would we well in fact we do want to

00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:16,079
update the yarn lock we want to make

00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:19,470
sure that these two tools interact as

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:23,040
nicely as possible so there once was a

00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:25,050
time when yarn and NPM the two command

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,660
line interfaces really walled off from

00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:29,100
each other but with NPM 7 we're going to

00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,139
see big improvements in their

00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:35,519
compatibility I'm really excited about

00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:38,790
that another place I'm excited is a

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:42,569
workspace support that's coming in NPM

00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:45,089
b7 workspaces are incredibly popular in

00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:48,990
large projects here you can see create

00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:50,759
react app and this is in fact the create

00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:53,449
react app project and if I look at their

00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:56,579
package.json they have to find

00:16:53,449 --> 00:17:00,689
workspaces and you can look in the

00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:04,860
packages directory to see that and now

00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:07,589
when I run NPM 7 install it will

00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:09,689
actually take just a moment because

00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:12,860
there are in fact a lot of packages that

00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:15,209
I need to need to download and install

00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:17,569
to uncompress into the node modules

00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:20,720
directory as part of create react

00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:23,659
it's it's a pretty big project but once

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,899
those packages do get downloaded and to

00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:28,909
get installed I will actually be able to

00:17:26,899 --> 00:17:32,120
look inside my node modules folder and

00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:36,049
you'll see exactly how workspaces really

00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:38,720
work so once that's done there we are

00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:41,809
I can look inside node modules and there

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,360
are a bunch but again we want to look at

00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:49,840
the ones that align with our packages

00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:55,509
directory and so let's look for react

00:17:49,840 --> 00:18:00,230
utils sorry I want to prep for that and

00:17:55,509 --> 00:18:01,850
now you can see that instead of just

00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,100
installing it as if it were a normal

00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:07,730
package it's actually created a symlink

00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:10,009
and so it's actually understood the

00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:12,620
workspace support and able to hydrate

00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:13,879
those the proper way and so that's

00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,700
something I'm really excited about an

00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:18,830
NPM seven running scripts and and other

00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:22,519
commands in a specific workspace it's

00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:24,799
going to be coming soon but this is just

00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:33,049
amazing progress and I'm really excited

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:35,269
about what the team's been doing cool so

00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:37,159
that's what's coming up in the NPM CLI

00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:39,379
and I'm super excited about that but

00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:41,840
again that's not the only piece of NPM

00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:43,850
there's there's also the registry and we

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,590
got a lot of questions when we announced

00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:47,840
that github was going to acquire NPM

00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:50,149
about what that meant for the public NPM

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,940
registry and I understand why people

00:18:50,149 --> 00:18:54,440
were curious because github actually

00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,529
already has a product that manages

00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:00,769
packages and it does manage NPM packages

00:18:57,529 --> 00:19:03,350
as well as docker maven nougat and ruby

00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:05,899
gems and so I think some people were

00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,970
concerned that we might get rid of NPM

00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:09,889
and replace it with github packages or

00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:12,970
that we might stop working on NPM

00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:16,460
support in github packages but in fact

00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:19,370
both products will continue to exist and

00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:22,100
we'll continue to invest in both of them

00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:25,100
and honestly they both have very

00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:28,789
different use cases first the NPM

00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,629
registry the NPM registry just must stay

00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:31,170
online forever

00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:33,780
those of you who remember

00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,970
left ad we'll remember that a single

00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,760
package being removed from NPM

00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:41,490
had devastating effects for the entire

00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:45,810
JavaScript ecosystem for JavaScript

00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:49,050
developers everywhere now imagine every

00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:51,000
JavaScript package disappears imagine

00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:53,160
that every time you run NPM installed it

00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,910
it can't bring in your dependencies that

00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,140
would just be an absolute unmitigated

00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:01,200
disaster

00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:03,360
so NPM will remain online forever and

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,690
the package URLs that you work with

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,830
today will continue to work we want this

00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:10,520
to be the place where you publish

00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:12,780
packages for the world to consume and

00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:15,510
we've been spending a lot of time lately

00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,220
talking to package authors maintainer

00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:22,010
Xand publishers about what it is that

00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:25,200
they want in NPM so NPM will continue to

00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:27,030
exist and github packages will also

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,820
continue to exist it's a different

00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:32,010
system entirely github packages supports

00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:34,320
private packages that you can share just

00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:36,360
within your organization and so this is

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,310
really helpful when you're building an

00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,320
application privately you can publish

00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:42,720
your dependencies to github packages and

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,390
then use them in the build tests and

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,250
deployment processes but it's also

00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:49,770
useful to have public packages and

00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,680
github packages as well if you're an

00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:54,480
open source author you can imagine

00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,760
publishing every build into github

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,720
packages as part of your CI process and

00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:02,130
that'll let you flight those changes

00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,140
before you actually release them to the

00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:07,080
public and then as part of your release

00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:09,600
process you publish the release package

00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:14,120
up to NPM itself and that's when you

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:17,790
give it to actual end users so for NPM

00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:20,700
we're immediately going to be engaging

00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:22,800
with the community the NPM CLI already

00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,820
has a great RFC process that guides its

00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,870
decision-making and its new features and

00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:30,210
meanwhile we started talking a lot more

00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:32,880
to package authors publishers and

00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:35,970
maintainer x' about how we can improve

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,100
NPM I've spent a lot of time listening

00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:40,920
and I hope to spend a lot more in the

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,660
coming weeks and months and while we do

00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,900
that we're spending an incredible effort

00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,540
on the registries

00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:49,240
for structure right now it hosts over a

00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:52,180
million JavaScript packages that can

00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,400
almost 85 billion downloads a month and

00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,050
we're updating the infrastructure to get

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,660
it ready for the next million packages

00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:01,810
and of course while we do that we're

00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:04,810
busy working on NPM v7 which I hope you

00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:06,090
can tell I'm super excited about and I

00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:09,190
hope that you are too

00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:11,260
looking longer-term we're excited about

00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:15,520
how we can integrate NP on the github

00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:18,220
for example ninety-five percent roughly

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,200
of NPM packages start their life on

00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:22,780
github.com

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:25,660
that means that we can provide now that

00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,610
github and npm are joined we can provide

00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:30,130
stronger assurances about the packages

00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:32,320
that you're using we can trace a bug to

00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:33,610
when it was opened as a github issue so

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,580
when it was fixed in a github pull

00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:39,130
request to a build that packaged it and

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,380
github actions to it being published as

00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:43,450
an NPM package and that allows us to

00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,520
really understand the security of a

00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:48,850
package and a change that goes into it

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:51,730
and to end later this year we're going

00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:54,310
to enable NPM Spade customers to move to

00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:56,650
github packages today NPM has several

00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:58,240
paid plans for private package hosting

00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:01,510
and we're going to set it up so that

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,700
paying NPM customers can move over to

00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:06,280
github packages this will let us focus

00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:08,350
each of the repositories on what it does

00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,910
best it will let github packages be a

00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:12,700
great solution for hosting private

00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:15,400
packages and let NPM continue to focus

00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:18,820
on being a great public registry for

00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,500
open source packages so we're really

00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,360
excited about the future for both of

00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,690
these products for github packages and

00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:27,550
for NPM and like I said earlier we're

00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:30,430
really interested in hearing about how

00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:32,380
you use these products like I said I

00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:33,880
love to learn about the projects that

00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,980
you're building and the packages that

00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,290
you're publishing so if you're

00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:41,140
interested in participating in the NPM

00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:45,670
CLI development process check out the

00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:48,160
NPM RFC's there at github calm / NPM /r

00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:49,630
f CS and if you want to follow along but

00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:53,140
you aren't quite ready to participate

00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:57,580
check out the NPM blog its blog NPM GS

00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:57,890
org the architect of the NPM CLI Isaac

00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,049
Slough

00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:03,230
we'll have some really great blog posts

00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:04,880
about what's coming in npm b7 and the

00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:07,460
status of that I'm really looking

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,230
forward to reading those and of course

00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:12,230
you should feel free to reach out to me

00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:15,140
i'm otamatone on github and on twitter

00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:17,299
but right now i'm gonna go back and join

00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,549
Martin and Dana and I'll be happy to

00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:21,309
answer your questions there so thanks so

00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:23,510
much

00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:25,309
well that's brilliant it

00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:28,250
thanks very much that was really enjoyed

00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:30,559
that one yeah so what live demos for

00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:32,179
start yeah that's fantastic great to see

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,130
you well done that was a took a lot of

00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,750
guts so thank you everything else going

00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:38,870
on today so that's brilliant what was

00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:40,549
really good to see was you know just NPM

00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:42,559
working so well with the rest of the

00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:44,690
JavaScript community you know the

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,240
integration with yarn was amazing to see

00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:49,280
and actually seen it working live so

00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,260
yeah really excited about what Isaac's

00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:54,020
and the team are doing with NPM v7

00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:56,450
that's fantastic the scale as well the

00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:58,880
you know it's just insane the scale in

00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:01,580
PM's I thought github is big an area not

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,850
soup as well it's insane so anyway and

00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:07,070
but before we go into Q&A and things and

00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:08,750
hear Danis be back and just wanna you

00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:12,020
know Dana you might notice from Dana

00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:14,360
she's just like tattoos you know it's

00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:16,429
that and I was telling Dana early on

00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,740
because day night she owns a vinyl a

00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:20,030
vinyl record store and I was I was

00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,040
telling a little bit something did you

00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:24,260
want to make any confession about about

00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:28,040
your your tattoo that you got a few

00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:32,679
years ago so this is what happens when

00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:35,630
when you know me too well isn't it yeah

00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:37,970
during a brief midlife crisis I may have

00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:41,630
ended up with a large tattoo on my leg

00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:43,900
that it is a script wrap wrapped around

00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:46,280
a dagger that says death before digital

00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:49,610
there's also a cassette tape in the mix

00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:53,120
there's no vinyl so you know why it's

00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:54,890
okay because you're my spirit brother

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,990
head you're my spirit brother

00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:59,720
we're digital nerds living in a digital

00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:01,760
word but we're analog first in all ways

00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,040
so you know what I'll take it you know I

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,600
actually listen to rush on cassette last

00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,230
night because that's what a nerd I am

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:14,650
yeah double cassette to wind down

00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:16,419
oh come on I don't want to start the

00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:25,960
rush war you know they got like 40

00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:27,549
freaking albums out I'll play the guitar

00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:32,080
later to entertain you okay now put my

00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:33,669
swing ask em pme3 7sl let the audit

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,900
functionality that you showed us I'm

00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:36,610
gonna tell you what I think it's a game

00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,799
changer you know for people with a

00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:41,559
attention span of a goldfish like myself

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,880
I love the crisp way that you can just

00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:46,270
go find the information that you need

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,530
it's gonna be a huge time-saver but we

00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:49,390
got some questions coming in remember

00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:52,120
right now you can go on to get up

00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,870
satellite comm slash discussions and ask

00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,360
Edie

00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:57,340
or Martin or myself you know what's more

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,780
Tom Sawyer I'll bring it but to have

00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,610
some questions about all the awesomeness

00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:02,650
that NPM is gonna be brain and github

00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:05,530
but we got one for you right now

00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:08,320
crew bot wants to know is there any look

00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:11,110
to better support webassembly ecosystem

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,320
maybe wasum or specific tools are you

00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:15,400
working on any of that stuff oh that's a

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,620
great question

00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,840
I'm actually a big fan of wasm or waz

00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm however you pronounce it you know

00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,950
that's that's not been top of mind for

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,020
me but I will definitely take that to

00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:27,910
the team I can imagine some ways that

00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:30,370
you know you could you could better

00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:33,070
package wisdom and especially you know

00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:34,780
go with that so yeah that's a that's a

00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:39,040
great question and I'm definitely follow

00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:41,110
up cool so yeah I mean there's been

00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,429
quite a few questions in the discussions

00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:44,470
and remember if you want to join in the

00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:47,049
questions answers just click on the

00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:49,360
discussions button or if you go on over

00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:51,669
to Gil observe like on lactis questions

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,440
you can answer Q&A but one of the

00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:55,210
biggest sort of threads I was seeing was

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,419
around you know why get her back wired

00:27:55,210 --> 00:28:01,480
MPM people asking about that and

00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:03,970
probably logan Volkers is got a good

00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:07,270
question here sort of their biggest

00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:09,460
question was when can we log in and

00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:11,320
deploy packages to NPM by just using

00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:14,530
like github credentials is there any any

00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:16,600
plans there I think that's a great idea

00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:19,480
yeah I'd love to be able to do that I

00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,020
think that having a single login that

00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,960
works for both

00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:25,390
github and npm is a great idea and I

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,620
especially think that it can help you

00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:28,470
know really nail down some of the

00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,760
multi-factor authentication scenarios

00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:33,090
you know like I said when I was talking

00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,310
about NPM on it I'm a huge fan of

00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:37,690
security when it comes to all of these

00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:40,150
packages and all of these repositories

00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:43,830
that we've been entrusted with it github

00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:47,380
and and an NPM and so I think that

00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:49,890
leveraging the github login to do that

00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,890
is a great idea

00:28:52,980 --> 00:29:01,000
we agree we agree we think that github

00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:03,760
is like github an NPM to me our beer and

00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,040
burritos or tacos and tequila we're all

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,540
the other amazing combinations like I

00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,970
can tell we're getting close to lunch

00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:11,800
because that is where my brain is that

00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:14,230
and I heard the edit hanging out there

00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,240
in London so go on to github at Twitter

00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:18,040
and tell ed where he can get some good

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,560
tacos and burritos and maybe some

00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,910
tequila buddy I know you want some we

00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:24,280
were just chatting about how you miss

00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:26,140
Austin it's not gonna be the same but

00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,940
it'll be close Martin any any clue there

00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:30,460
where I can get some some good tequila

00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:32,590
over in London even though you're no no

00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,300
during the log down knowing Cambridge

00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:35,680
definitely not good Funko's anyway

00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:38,680
unless you've made them yourself not in

00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:41,770
Cambridge where I live so yeah anyway

00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,970
that's well we should probably which

00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:44,080
probably mean I don't know if we've got

00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:45,520
time for one more question maybe

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:50,010
actually yeah well we're on the oddest

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:52,450
of Bois Bogdan her van was saying around

00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:55,150
there not super familiar with the NPM

00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,380
ecosystem but how does that audit so you

00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:59,290
were talking about how does that help

00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:00,820
him if the packages include included

00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:05,500
directly reference or the packages with

00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:07,420
vulnerabilities right so NPM audit

00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:10,300
actually works by looking at the entire

00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:13,690
dependency graph of your of your project

00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:14,890
so if you depend on a project a package

00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:16,810
like make therapy

00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:21,340
make therapy is just a really simple

00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:23,920
useful utility that makes ders but it

00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:27,400
depends on on other things and make the

00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:29,080
repeat itself doesn't necessarily have a

00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,180
vulnerability but the packages it

00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,770
depends on does so NPM audit can

00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,620
actually take a look at that entire

00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:37,039
graph

00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:39,380
and just spider everything and look at

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:42,080
all of the packages that you're using it

00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:45,260
can compare that to a list of CVEs

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,840
a CVE is a common vulnerability and

00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:50,690
exposure that's a you know really

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,549
technical name for a security hole and

00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:55,549
so it can actually understand exactly

00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:57,950
the packages that you're using that have

00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:59,900
those security holes even if you're not

00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:02,179
depending on them directly it can you

00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:05,360
know walk that entire graph and so it's

00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:07,279
very useful to understand precisely the

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,080
problems that you might inherit in your

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,700
codebase even though you didn't write

00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,470
them and you're not even depending on

00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:16,220
them directly you're just pulling them

00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:19,820
in you know through a second or third

00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:21,590
level got it that's fantastic thanks ed

00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:23,330
so again thank you very much Pete I'm

00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:24,860
thanks to that great session ed will be

00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:27,080
joining us in the Q&A and the

00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:29,330
discussions for the next 30 minutes so

00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,950
head on over there and the team the NPM

00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:32,899
team will also be in there in the Q&A as

00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:35,029
well so please go along and see what you

00:31:32,899 --> 00:31:36,529
see what you want to talk about but with

00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:39,770
that ed we'll wrap up you so thank you

00:31:36,529 --> 00:31:42,809
very much for your time and yes mediator

00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:42,809
