	Presented by Luca Cipriani, CIO, Arduino

The process of taking software from the development stage through testing and into production can be labor-intensive, expensive, and most of all, time consuming. Whether you're a hobbyist, an open source maintainer, or an organization, the single truth remains: We can’t buy time. Success is often determined by how efficiently we are using our time. In order to increase our efficiencies, we turned to GitHub Actions to automate our workflows for both the software and hardware we produce. We are now able to reprogram our Arduino board, test the input/output of the hardware, and then send the results back to GitHub Actions. We can completely automate not just a continuous integration of the software but also of the hardware using solely online tools. In this talk, we'll run through the workflows Arduino has implemented with GitHub Actions and show attendees ways that they can take the first steps into bringing GitHub Actions into their development cycle.

GitHub Satellite: A community connected by code

On May 6th, we threw a free virtual event featuring developers working together on the world’s software, announcements from the GitHub team, and inspiring performances by artists who code.
