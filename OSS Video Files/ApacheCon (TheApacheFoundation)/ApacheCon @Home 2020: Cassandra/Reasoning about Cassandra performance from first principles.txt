Description: 
	Reasoning about Cassandra performance from first principles

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

There are a plethora of articles and blog posts on Cassandra performance and performance tuning. Typically these resources contain specific pieces of advice on how to improve read or write throughput. The problem with these resources is that they focus on a specific solution to specific problem. In this talk we will start from first principles and develop a mental model that will allow us to reason about Cassandra's performance. The goal of the talk is for attendees to leave with a deeper understanding of how Cassandra works and how they can use that information to think through Cassandra's performance characteristics. We will start off by looking at how Cassandra stores data, the underlying data structures, and the implications of these design choices. The next two parts of the talk will discuss how Cassandra handles reads and writes and the associated trade-offs in the context of distributed systems. This talk is suitable both for those that regularly use Cassandra as well as those who are new to Cassandra because we focus on the ideas and principles behind Cassandra, rather than specific APIs or configurations.
