Garbage Collection can be painful, impact performance and stability, and can even take down entire clusters. In this talk, we will start by going over the 5 most common reasons for GC in Apache Cassandra. Then we will discuss ways to address these issues. And end with how to monitor your cluster going forward to avoid running into GC problems.

Spent over 6 years working with Apache Cassandra as an SE at Datastax, Caroline is now helping customers increase performance and provide stability with their JVM at Azul Systems. Originally from France, she has spent most of her life in NYC and holds a BA in Computer Science from NYU and MBA from NYU Stern School of Business.
