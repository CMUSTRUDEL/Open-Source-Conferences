Elegant and fully controllable Cassandra cluster for local testing and development. A modern and robust alternative to ccm (Cassandra Cluster Manager), taking advantage of containers, while keeping the full control of Cassandra configuration. This talk will demonstrate how to easily test locally against a cluster with production like features, for example: multi DC, SSL, Authentication etc.
