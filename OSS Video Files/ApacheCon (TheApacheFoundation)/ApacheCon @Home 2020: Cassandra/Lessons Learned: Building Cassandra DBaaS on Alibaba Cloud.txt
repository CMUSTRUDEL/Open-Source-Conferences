	Lessons Learned: Building Cassandra DBaaS on Alibaba Cloud
Maxwell Guo

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

During this session, we will share the lessons we learned when we built Apache Cassandra as a Service on Alibaba Cloud. Specific topics include: - how we boosted Cassandra performance through soft raid on cloud disk, - why we do a continuous full incremental backup - how to apply automatic data repairs Additionally, we will share the experience of doing non-stop data migration between different Cassandra clusters and between Cassandra and other databases as well as how we optimize a Cassandra service for different use case.

Maxwell is a cloud software architect at Alibaba, working on offering Apache Cassandra as a cloud based service.
