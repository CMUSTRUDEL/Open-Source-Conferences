Cassandra is widely adopted in real-world applications and used by large and sometimes mission-critical applications because of its high performance, high availability and high scalability. However, there is still some room for improvement to take Cassandra to the next level. We have been contributing to Cassandra to make it more capable, faster, and more reliable by, for example, proposing non-invasive ACID transaction library, adding GroupCommitLogService, and maintaining and conducting Jepsen testing for lightweight transactions. This talk will present the contributions we have done including the latest updates in more detail, and the reasons why we made such contributions. This talk will be one of the good starting points for discussing the next generation Cassandra.
