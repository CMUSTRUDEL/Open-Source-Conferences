Cassandra is widely used in key business scenarios in Huawei Consumer Cloud. You can find Cassandra databases serving as the real-time data store behind almost all Huawei consumer electronic products that are used by billions of people in China and the rest of the world. With a long history of Cassandra adoption ever since 2010, Huawei Consumer Cloudâ€™s Cassandra deployments have grown to 30,000+ nodes, supporting more than 10 million operations per second with average latency of 4ms, and the maximum number of table records reaches 300 billion. Along this journey, we have gained a lot of experience in data modeling, fine-tuning leveled compaction with high node density, day-to-day operations such as repair and handling tombstones, monitoring and problem identification and quick resolution under very tight SLA, which we are thrilled to share with the community. We also summarized our lessons learned and best practices in managing those low-latency, high-concurrency and mission-critical use cases.
