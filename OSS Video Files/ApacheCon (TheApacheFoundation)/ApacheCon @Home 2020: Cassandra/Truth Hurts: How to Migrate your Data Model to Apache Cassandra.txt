	Truth Hurts: How to Migrate your Data Model to Apache Cassandra
Amanda Moran

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

I just took a DNA test, and it turns out my data model is 100% wrong. This session will focus on how to correctly data model for Apache Cassandra and NoSQL databases. Topics will include: - A brief comparison of relational databases and NoSQL databases - The benefits of Apache Cassandra - Transitioning a relational data model to a Cassandra data model - Common issues that can be solved with a good data model This session is intended for folks new to Cassandra/NoSQL or folks transitioning from operations to a more data engineering and cloud-focused role.

Amanda has been an committer and PMC member for Apache Trafodion since 2015. She was previously a Developer Advocate with DataStax where she spent many, many hours helping users get better with Apache Cassandra.
