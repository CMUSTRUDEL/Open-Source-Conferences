Apache Cassandra manages access by using traditional usernames and passwords. However, organizations and developers are moving towards more secure access management techniques for programmatic access, such as using short-term credentials. In this talk, we will dive deep on how Amazon Web Services (AWS) designed and built an open-source authentication plugin for Cassandra drivers that enables developers to use short term credentials for access management instead of hard-coding credentials in their application code. You will learn how the plugin integrates with Cassandra drivers and how the security model works in comparison to traditional authentication.
