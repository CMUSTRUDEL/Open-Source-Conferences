Kubernetes is becoming a standard tool to deploy large scale infrastructure and lately, Apache Cassandra. We'll look at some of the methods used to deploy Cassandra using Kubernetes including storage options, networking configuration, and monitoring. In the past year, the Apache Cassandra project has also taken on the task of creating a common operator closer to the project. This will be a chance to get the latest status of the operator effort and where it will be headed post-Cassandra 4.0.

Patrick McFadin is the VP of Developer Relations at DataStax, where he leads a team devoted to making users of Apache Cassandra successful. He has also worked as Chief Evangelist for Apache Cassandra and consultant for DataStax, where he helped build some of the largest and exciting deployments in production. Previous to DataStax, he was Chief Architect at Hobsons and an Oracle DBA/Developer for over 15 years.
