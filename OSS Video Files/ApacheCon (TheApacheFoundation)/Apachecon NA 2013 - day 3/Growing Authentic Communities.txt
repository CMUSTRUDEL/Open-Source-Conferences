gentlemen welcome to the third and last

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:11,670
day of Apache con 2013 just before we

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,500
get started one quick announcement the

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,020
apache software foundation realizes that

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,660
sometimes there is a need to print

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,789
things boarding passes particularly if

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,550
you're shipping anything home labels and

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,320
so on so thanks to the asf and stephen

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,390
half the way there is a printer at the

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,929
SF stand if you need to do any printing

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,420
please feel free to go and use that it

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:37,260
sits there for us all to use so without

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,930
further ado here's Skip newbury of the

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:45,750
technology association of oregon great

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:47,789
thank you very much so you're definitely

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,739
not here to hear me talk so I'll keep

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,930
this brief I have the the job of

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:54,329
introducing Luca nice the founder and

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,280
CEO puppet labs and what's interesting

00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,199
about Luke and there's a little bit

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,600
reporting about this out on the web but

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:04,199
you know he grew up in Tennessee on a

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,489
hippie commune about 1600 people and you

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,250
know that was how he spent his formative

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:11,189
years and between then and now of course

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,890
a lot has happened found his way to

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,409
Oregon graduate of reed college and

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,600
afterwards ended up working as a system

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,549
administrator saw a lot that he wanted

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,920
to change and kind of took it upon

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:26,759
himself to develop what he came puppet

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,220
and the rest is history he now runs a

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:33,060
company that was recently recognized as

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:35,130
one of the top 25 enterprise startups to

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,280
bet your career on their growing

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,720
exponentially and that's just one of the

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,939
many awards that they've received

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,180
recently so without further ado I want

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:48,380
to see the floor here to Luca nice of

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,380
puppet labs take it away

00:01:51,100 --> 00:02:01,700
thank you skip so I'm gonna talk about

00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:04,520
community today but before that I want

00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,530
to point out that nearly everything in

00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,910
this talk I don't mean to say that this

00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,679
is all right I don't mean to say that

00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,630
you should believe everything I say

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,240
before i started the puppet community i

00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,230
had some open source experience but i

00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,150
wouldn't say that i had a lot and I

00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:20,270
certainly had no experience in a

00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,610
leadership position I'd worked in I had

00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:24,410
been involved in a lot more bad examples

00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,030
you know a lot more horrible warning

00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,520
type situations and I had good examples

00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:30,110
and most of what we've done in our

00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,760
community has been through trial and

00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,380
error that a lot of a lot of right ways

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,870
to do things of course there are far

00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:38,060
more wrong ways to do things and in

00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,490
general there are plenty of things we

00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,540
still do wrong and what I try to ask of

00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,220
everybody whether it's people in my

00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,410
company people my community or you know

00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,240
people in my personal life is to follow

00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,500
Hanlon's razor which is never attribute

00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,560
to malice that which can be adequately

00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,820
explained by incompetents and I like to

00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,630
think of that as a rather you think that

00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,650
I was stupid than evil and one of the

00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,820
things that I think has helped our

00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,489
community is I'm always willing to admit

00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:03,170
that I'm wrong so I'm not up here to say

00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:04,310
that this is all the right answer it's

00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:06,769
just this is one thing that's worked for

00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,680
me so I really wanted to call this talk

00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:11,390
building communities that's the natural

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,650
way of talking about it but the truth is

00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,600
it's not really about building it's

00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,310
about growing it's not like you can go

00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,630
down to the store you know if you want

00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,950
to go the house you can buy all the

00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,299
materials you need to do that you can

00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,500
just do it yourself you don't have to

00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:23,330
ask the permission of the house or the

00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,580
land or the wood what's not going to

00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:27,470
fight back at you generally this is a

00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,519
lot more like you have you can lay all

00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,690
the groundwork but just because you

00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:30,799
build it doesn't mean that everybody is

00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:35,120
going to show up you have to work very

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:37,130
hard to kind of kind of grow the thing

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,290
from the bottom up you can't just force

00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,790
it into place on and I think one of the

00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:44,600
reasons people are interested in me

00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:46,549
talking was that because this is a you

00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,170
know I'm running a company and a project

00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:49,730
at the same time and it's fantastically

00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,920
difficult to a lot of totally kind of

00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:54,650
think you can force the creation of a

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,880
community and that's especially where

00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,440
things start to go wrong if you're in a

00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,840
company and you try to kind of force it

00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,400
to happen so I wanted to give a little

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,970
bit of history about puppets you have an

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,770
idea

00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:06,680
what kinds of communities I'm talking

00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:09,140
about what size of communities and you

00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,730
know what we did in ours and then I want

00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,200
to talk through some examples and some

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:15,410
some things we've learned in the course

00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:19,220
of doing this so I started the project

00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:20,420
in 2005 and when I started it I didn't

00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,560
even create a user list because it was

00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,850
going to be it was another 10 months

00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,990
before we eat before I would have

00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,370
recommended that anybody used the

00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,050
project so I said well start with the

00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,510
dev list I was the only user on that

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,980
list of course and I went and built some

00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:37,310
of the infrastructure like an IRC

00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:39,410
channel but there was no one there one

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,820
of the things that's a little bit a

00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,650
little bit different about puppet it's

00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,330
not exactly unique but it's not that

00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,790
common is when I started the project i

00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,920
started a company and the software at

00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,840
the same time this isn't the thing that

00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,040
i did is a hobby for three or four years

00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,740
realized it could be an interesting

00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,030
company and then you know decided to

00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,620
start commercializing it from the very

00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,060
first day that i started the product the

00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,980
project i wanted to build a software

00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,330
company that allowed me to make that in

00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,770
which i could make enough money to

00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,660
afford to pay developers to work in the

00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,040
software and that was always the way I

00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,410
thought about it we have very big

00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,760
problems in the operation space I didn't

00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,600
think I could solve them all by myself I

00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:16,400
know strange and so my goal was to find

00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,840
a way to make enough money to pay much

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,310
of software developers but one of the

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,290
one of the reasons that I did that is

00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:24,470
I've been in other software communities

00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:26,360
where the the criteria for whether the

00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,979
software was good or not didn't really

00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,570
relate to whether the users liked it or

00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:32,479
whether it worked to solve the problems

00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:34,580
on and so what I wanted was a very clean

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,700
and simple way of saying how can i tell

00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,320
if my users like my software and turns

00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,300
out there's a globally agreed-upon

00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,950
metric for determining how much someone

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,020
likes something and it's they're willing

00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,970
to exchange money for it so I thought

00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:49,010
this is a pretty good test so if I can

00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,270
build a piece of software and i love it

00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,410
everyone i know loves it but no one's

00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,360
willing to pay anything for anything

00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:56,090
around it it's probably not very good

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,380
software so this decision both the

00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,060
decision to start the company and the

00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,590
fact that i was open about this this is

00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,840
a slide that I've been showing you know

00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:05,479
some form of this slide for years I

00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:08,150
think this was my lunch in Heathrow on

00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:09,650
the way back from India in 2006 and the

00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,390
reason I took the picture is with I was

00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,770
in an airport do you see how dangerous

00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,050
they are in England that's metal

00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,280
silverware

00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:20,710
could have taken over the whole place

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:22,599
it's crazy so that whole starting a

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,300
company at the same time changed a lot

00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:29,409
about how we built the community so four

00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:33,930
years later we had seen fifty thousand

00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:36,819
percent growth in our user community and

00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:38,280
at the time there weren't a lot of when

00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:40,240
i started puppet there were not a lot of

00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,440
system ministries so i probably should

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,819
have said this so pop it as a tool for

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,870
sysadmin so you probably all know that

00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,270
you're using it's running on your

00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,379
laptop's things like that right so it's

00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,539
a tool for sis admins to make their

00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:50,680
stupid computers do what they want so

00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:53,020
all the people that we're talking about

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,090
they're pretty much also sentence when I

00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,740
started puppet there were very few

00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:59,590
sysadmin communities out there sis

00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,030
admins there surly you know the kind of

00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:04,539
like developers but with less social

00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:09,370
skills I know it is possible i trust me

00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:10,960
um and so we were trying to build about

00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,710
this time this is one of the largest is

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,780
happening committees it's not the

00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:17,770
largest by any stretch right but go find

00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:19,150
the top five you know IRC channels that

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,680
have sis admins in them and actually

00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,639
there's only three that's you know some

00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,840
of those things like to just aren't a

00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:24,069
lot of them out there so i was really

00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,250
kind of starting from scratch in a lot

00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:29,919
of ways we had by this time we got into

00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,870
three employees and we had one event it

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,699
was about 80 people in san francisco

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:36,370
this was also the year that we took

00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:38,440
venture capital and it was the year

00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,690
before this that i gave my wife gave

00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,550
birth to twins which was a little

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,680
momentous to but didn't affect the

00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:47,889
growth would give me that much so four

00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,210
years after that we're now ten times

00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:51,759
that growth another growth is dropped

00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,949
dramatically from fifty thousand percent

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,599
in four years to only 10 x so we've got

00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:57,550
more than 5,000 people on our user list

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,930
and if you go through all of our

00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,539
different community properties you know

00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:04,690
our questions site and our Forge you

00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:08,020
know yeah it could be it's really above

00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:09,669
10,000 total on large dev list a very

00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,199
large IRC channel and what really

00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:13,360
surprises me is that not just the

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,580
numbers of people in our community but

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,050
that they're really it's a really

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,849
functional community to there's a lot of

00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,960
people actually getting a real work done

00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:24,759
and still operating successfully in it

00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,500
just in the last year we've we've now

00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:27,210
and then I wrote this on sunday the

00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,880
number is

00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:31,830
above 900 Forge modules we've more than

00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,200
tripled in the last year the the number

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:38,399
of pre-built solutions people publish on

00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:40,320
that last year we had 17 I think or 16

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,419
events around the world including puppet

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,219
conf in San Francisco which we're going

00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:46,140
to have again in August this year last

00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:48,060
year was about 850 people this year

00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,610
we're hoping for about 1600 we're now

00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,810
about to about 120 employees and as of a

00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,600
few months ago for the very first time

00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:55,980
we have a community manager somebody

00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,050
who's actually dedicated to trying to

00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:01,500
make sure that the mistakes we made here

00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:04,589
we don't repeat again so how do we go

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,270
about encouraging building this kind of

00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:08,850
community growing as kind of community

00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,589
and especially one of the things that I

00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,839
think we've done relatively well in the

00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:15,930
public community is make pretty major

00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,040
changes without having major outcry and

00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,320
I think this is one of the things that

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,570
is really hard to do in communities

00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,920
because the the thing that allows the

00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,630
community to exist is a sense of

00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,399
identity and when you go in and change

00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,720
anything that people associate with

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,640
their identity they start to get

00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,529
slightly upset so I think that's one of

00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:36,270
the the very difficult two things in

00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:37,709
committee to do in community one of the

00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,560
first reactions I hear from almost

00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:41,220
anybody especially anybody in a company

00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:45,570
what they're going to build a community

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:47,250
is how do I make sure I can control you

00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,570
know that that people don't do too much

00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,920
of something how do I make sure people

00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,050
don't ask you many questions or aren't

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,850
too rude or things like that I always

00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,740
tell people that your biggest problem

00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,510
you know empty lists don't need

00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,000
moderation your biggest problem is not

00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,290
how do I control all of the traffic on

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,880
my website how do I control all the

00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,709
community right your biggest problem is

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,000
seriously there's no one there you know

00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:07,290
the vast majority of communities the

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,089
vast majority of companies the vast

00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,010
majority of software projects don't have

00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:12,480
your users don't have customers don't

00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,010
you know your your biggest problem is

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,440
this getting to the point where you're

00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,790
lucky enough to have a community

00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,640
management problem getting what were you

00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:23,310
lucky enough to have you know the need

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,140
to do things like moderation to enforce

00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,630
you know community guidelines or things

00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,640
like that so a lot of peoples natural

00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,709
first reactions are cover the when

00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,089
traffic is too large and I just think

00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:34,290
that's a the wrong way to look about

00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:36,150
look at it it's like if you're building

00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,650
a website and you know it takes you

00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,620
three months to build the site and seven

00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,120
months to build the scalable back end

00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,710
you get to the end your you know your 10

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,779
months into the project you have 0 users

00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:46,220
and you know you could launch that site

00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:47,450
seven months earlier you didn't need the

00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:51,730
back end until you actually have any

00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:54,020
users um so beyond that focus on

00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,370
worrying more about getting people into

00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,970
the community that I was about what they

00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:00,740
were doing there my mic or tactic and

00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,510
building my community was to answer

00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,130
every single question and I really do

00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,230
mean that from the time that i started

00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,310
in 2005 again there was no one there at

00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,600
the time there weren't any questions at

00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,310
the time but by around two thousand six

00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,250
there were a lot of people showing up

00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:15,800
asking a lot of questions and I my goal

00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,779
was to essentially be present enough to

00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,250
be active enough that even though I

00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:20,480
might be the only other person in the

00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,430
room right maybe the only other person

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:27,440
who list I wanted to feel like a crowded

00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:30,260
room and I was very very responsive very

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,170
active and you know you just kind of you

00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,700
gotta hustle all day and but one of the

00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,470
most important things about that is you

00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,360
even have to answer even when you don't

00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:40,070
know in the early days of a community

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,940
there are a lot of problems a lot of

00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,230
things you don't know so when he shows

00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,990
up since hey how do I solve this problem

00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:46,820
you kind of go I don't know um you need

00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,170
to be comfortable saying that the only

00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,060
thing you have in the early days of a

00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,350
community is is a small amount of

00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,020
credibility you haven't done anything

00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:56,600
you haven't you know you don't have the

00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:58,790
the proof but what you can do is is

00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,930
build trust with your community and if

00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,830
you start telling people things that

00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,150
aren't true if you start telling people

00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:04,100
oh yeah you can definitely do that or

00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:06,140
yes it'll scale or yes it's definitely

00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,820
secure or you know all these things that

00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,380
you hope were true that you think are

00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,510
true because you know you're smart and

00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,070
attractive in things like that but that

00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:15,050
doesn't mean that the product will work

00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:17,420
for what your customers what your users

00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:19,310
are trying to do with it so in those

00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:23,089
early days truth is more important than

00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:24,470
anything at all and so my goal was to

00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:26,450
answer everything and engage with people

00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,980
on whether this would work whether it's

00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,959
a good idea whether you should try that

00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,220
and in many cases I would say this isn't

00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:32,750
a good idea I don't think you should try

00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,100
that I think if you tried it'll fail and

00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,110
in some of those cases people would go

00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,450
you know what I'm going to do it anyway

00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:39,709
screw you and you know bad things that

00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,150
happen or great things would happen who

00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:42,560
knew and a lot of cases what would

00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:44,300
happen is people would go okay thanks

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,190
and they leave they come back in a year

00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,570
later check the project out again see if

00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,950
it works within that time but in the

00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,060
meantime they would go tell all their

00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,980
friends you know hey you should check

00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,000
this thing out maybe you

00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,160
be more appropriate for you than it was

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,570
for me I had a lot of people that I've

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,220
talked over the years who said you know

00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,810
I heard about it it didn't work for me

00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,190
it wasn't a good idea I didn't actually

00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,500
have any computers you know whatever the

00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:05,050
answer was on but I told my friends

00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,120
about it and they loved it so it really

00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:09,240
there's a lot of value in just making

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,579
sure you're truthful about the situation

00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,470
one of the things is relatively quickly

00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:15,579
have to learn even though you you want

00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,290
to make sure that every question is

00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:19,540
answered you don't always want to answer

00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:21,730
them all right away you have to give

00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,860
room for somebody else to show up and be

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,920
right this is something that as I became

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:29,560
as I went from being a project lead to

00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,970
being a CEO you have the same thing you

00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,959
have to learn how to let other people

00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,389
answer you if they learn how to let

00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:36,430
other people take the floor and really

00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:37,600
gain expertise and a lot of cases be

00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,850
wrong you have to learn how to let

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,350
somebody else in a list show up answer

00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,389
question and be incorrect and what you

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,010
don't want to do is five seconds after

00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,720
that happens send an email to the list

00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:48,639
pointing out how wrong that person is

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,589
and then correcting him or her in front

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,139
of the entire community that's not the

00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:54,370
right way to do it um just like when I'm

00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:56,110
in a meeting and somebody makes a

00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:59,199
mistake I don't stand up and go that's

00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,850
wrong here's the right answer so you

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,160
have to work with the community to help

00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,360
them grow to become the people who are

00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,550
going to answer your questions and build

00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,550
things for you um you have to give

00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:11,730
others time to help so this transparency

00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,600
this this willingness to admit that

00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,069
everything's not perfect that there are

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,660
mistakes that there are problems that

00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:19,510
your project won't work for every single

00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,920
use case it can be hard and the truth is

00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,000
that if your project worked for every

00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,079
use case you probably wouldn't be

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,360
building it right what's the whole point

00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:27,220
in starting a project is it that there's

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,019
some new special thing that makes you

00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,100
different that makes you special that's

00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:33,130
why you built the thing in the first

00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,569
place so acting like that new special

00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,980
purpose thing should also work for

00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:38,230
everything else it doesn't make much

00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,779
sense but people's goal you know people

00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:42,850
are really hesitant to say yep it won't

00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:45,040
work for that and this is especially

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,899
hard because you kind of have two states

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,209
in the most projects one in the early

00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:50,470
days your project sucks right you just

00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:51,490
started it doesn't have any users

00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,170
there's nobody actually using it in

00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,579
production anywhere it's got lots of

00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,079
bugs it's unstable it doesn't probably

00:14:54,579 --> 00:14:58,600
work in the platform you care about it's

00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,730
got all these problems and if it's

00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,860
amateur well now it's really slow you

00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,450
can't get you can't things you can't get

00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,770
things to move very quickly

00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,420
and you know they're all these other

00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,430
kind of what feel like political issues

00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,780
and so what you have to do is flip that

00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,770
around and say well there are things

00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,970
that are great about each of those

00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:15,010
status right if you're in an early stage

00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:17,410
project you can move very very quickly

00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:18,730
you can be extremely responsive and if

00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,960
you're at a late stage project your

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,160
integrated with everything you run on

00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,690
everything you're extremely stable

00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,160
you're very secure you've got a lot of

00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,720
users or a lot of people who are trained

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,060
on the project so you're really need to

00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,460
have to have to look at what are the

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,440
great aspects of the stage that you're

00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,910
at and focus on that and focus on

00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,580
getting value from that in your

00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:39,780
community and not not be uncomfortable

00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,650
admitting what's not what's not great I

00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,870
talked earlier about some of the major

00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:47,500
transitions we've gone through at in the

00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:49,120
puppet community and how transparency is

00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,040
a big enabler for what's allowed us to

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,110
get through those things so when we go

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,970
to do a big thing we try to be very

00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,650
clear about everything not just what

00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,450
we're doing but really the why I feel

00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:00,790
like and there are a lot of great talks

00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:03,460
on this I think Daniel pink has a great

00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:05,920
TED talk on this on you have to really

00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:09,070
be able to talk about the whys and not

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,060
just the house and the what's so when

00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,800
you talk about what you're going to do

00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,880
hey here's this transition we need to

00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,710
make in the community hears this thing

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,680
we need to do that's a really big shift

00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:19,540
you have to talk about why that's an

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,040
important shift and sometimes the y is

00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,540
for you and sometimes the wise for them

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,760
but you need to go to go all the way

00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,740
through that on and one of the keys

00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,900
again every one of my community knew I

00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,910
was trying to make money they all knew I

00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,380
had a company they all knew that a lot

00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:34,330
of its when I talked about what I was

00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,770
doing when I talked about why this made

00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:38,650
sense for us why this made sense for

00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:39,880
them I could say you know this is this

00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,500
is the right trade off from my

00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,750
organization this is the right trade off

00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,010
for you and that meant that almost no

00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,840
one was cynical right no one looked at

00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:49,410
me and said I think he's doing that to

00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:53,320
make money because I would go well yeah

00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:55,000
so it really helped and you know for

00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,260
what it's worth I run the same kind of

00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,300
full transparency in my own organization

00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:00,330
everybody my company knows how much

00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,680
money is in our bank account every week

00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:04,030
so this kind of transparency is it's

00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,070
difficult for many people it's

00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,810
especially difficult for companies if

00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:09,760
you've got a you know a financial

00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:12,310
organization a for-profit company that's

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,770
trying to build a community they're

00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:16,510
often doing it somewhat cynically and

00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,459
to become authentic they have to kind of

00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,740
be willing to tell the truth be willing

00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:23,260
to be transparent about what's actually

00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,910
happening this is especially true if

00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,020
they aren't the founding developers of

00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,290
the project they're joining the

00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:31,180
community being willing to say this is

00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,920
why we're here this is what we get out

00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,750
of this relationship we know you're not

00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,980
doing this for altruistic reasons you're

00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,350
a for-profit company you're literally

00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,270
forbidden by the structures of your

00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:43,960
company to do things for altruistic

00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:46,480
reasons so companies have to work extra

00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,320
hard to demonstrate that authenticity to

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,940
demonstrate that they're being

00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:53,890
transparent it's very strange so I so I

00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,360
mentioned earlier have 120 employees my

00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:57,160
company it's just probably more people

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,690
than that in this room it now but my

00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,640
company I have a rule that when you're

00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:02,830
in a meeting you don't get to use your

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,360
laptop and I will I have a rule that

00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,890
every time somebody in the meeting is

00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,210
looking at an electronic device they're

00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,550
the first person to get a question as to

00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:12,730
them so not used to this all people to

00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:14,050
laptops anyway so companies are

00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:17,290
naturally secretive their natural

00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:19,930
reaction is to not tell is to tell the

00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:21,280
least amount possible to everybody and

00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,230
you just kind of have to suck it up this

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,930
is open source you got to be a lot more

00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,610
open about everything but transparency

00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:29,230
isn't quite the same thing as openness

00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:31,810
open this is telling everybody

00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:34,030
everything and transparency is being

00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,290
being willing to say here you know being

00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,670
open about everything you can and then

00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,810
main transparent about what you can't be

00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:40,510
open about you know there are a lot of

00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:43,060
questions I still do a lot of talks at

00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:45,940
pop comps and I do a Q&A at almost every

00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:48,520
one of them I've got one in London and

00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,930
Amsterdam coming up and all answer

00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,070
almost any question but a yellow there

00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,260
are some questions will ask me like you

00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,880
know whatever with the stock allocations

00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,320
of the company aren't I'm gonna go can't

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,300
tell you that right so it's not about

00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,940
dodging it's not like you have to answer

00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,870
everything but you do need to be

00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,750
transparent about what you can't be open

00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:05,530
about this kind of being pretty awesome

00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,890
though there are a lot of cases where

00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:10,480
this this process of being willing to

00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,770
admit where things don't work has worked

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,450
out really well there was this period of

00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:15,250
time where one of our core community

00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:17,140
members was in Australia I'm Australia

00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,990
is I have no idea why is chock-full of

00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,370
greatest admins and while I was sleeping

00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:23,080
he would file tickets and feature

00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,430
requests and things like that and when

00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,570
he was sleeping i would go fix them all

00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,640
or add those features and it was this

00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:29,690
kind of

00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,610
tik tok kind of relationship that

00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:34,039
wouldn't have worked if I was trying to

00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:37,940
be you know trying to act like we were

00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:40,000
more awesome than we were I think almost

00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,260
every community has this rule be nice

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,730
not very many communities succeed at

00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:47,630
being nice a lot of cases people are Oh

00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:48,799
people are comfortable with certain

00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:51,470
kinds of rudeness people are comfortable

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:56,740
with technical rudeness well it's okay

00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:58,970
if I mean to that person they're wrong I

00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:01,059
actually don't know how we succeeded at

00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:04,100
this I can't point to a technique or a

00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:07,190
practice that that we had that resulted

00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:08,900
in people generally actually being

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,909
polite and nice you Heather and

00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:14,600
primarily focused on getting the work

00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:17,539
done rather than you know scoring points

00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:20,210
one of the things that I am both most

00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:22,100
surprised by and most its most impressed

00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,900
by is almost the complete lack of

00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,700
religion in our community and again

00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,990
these are cysts admins their religious

00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,070
about almost everything and almost

00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,620
everything their religious about does

00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:32,210
not matter at all like most things that

00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,350
people are you know religious about in

00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,340
technical communities that's why it's

00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:37,190
religion right you like you've gone

00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,750
beyond the rational excuses for why you

00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:40,340
like this technology for the other

00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,400
versus the other one and you're into

00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:46,429
just like raw emotion at that point so

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,049
we really have a lot of people who are

00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:49,940
you know again focused on the problems

00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:52,250
and how to solve them and not focused on

00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:54,230
you know scoring points who's right you

00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,179
know I I have I came to this conclusion

00:20:54,230 --> 00:21:00,530
in 1999 and I'm not going to change my

00:20:56,179 --> 00:21:02,390
mind now we don't get a lot of that for

00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:05,690
my purposes and frankly if your if your

00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:08,020
goal is growth this is the almost the

00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:10,400
only thing you can't afford to get wrong

00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:12,409
that's that's not really true but if

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,000
your goal is growth you have to have a

00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:14,990
community that embraces newbies and this

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,490
is one of the things I think a lot of

00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,929
communities really struggle with because

00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:20,150
the goal is on the one hand to build

00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:22,070
credibility community become become kind

00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,990
of one of the inside circle to become to

00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,700
get a lot of experience to get up to

00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,650
kind of build your name in the community

00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,210
and in that case when you want to hold

00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:31,220
those people who participate so much you

00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:33,110
want to hold them up on a pedestal it's

00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,850
hard at the same time say people who

00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,140
show up and don't know anything about

00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:38,570
the project should be treated really

00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,950
well also but in our world we worked

00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,940
very hard to make sure that when you

00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,620
show up and you ask what

00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,940
seems like a stupid question we still

00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,200
treat you the respect every time we

00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,750
never wanted somebody to show up and

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,280
feel like they shouldn't ask a question

00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,050
it shouldn't be confused or they should

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,120
be more educated than they were we

00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:55,730
wanted a very newbie friendly community

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,800
and you know that's that's really worked

00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:59,330
out very well for us our entire

00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,610
community has grown by word of mouth

00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:03,620
again we had 17 events last year we're

00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,940
going to have I said 30 this year the

00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,480
truth isn't with the total numbers we're

00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,440
going to have about 15 just this quarter

00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,270
obviously all of us can do that math

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,070
that should be something like 60 events

00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:14,090
I don't know if it's going to actually

00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:16,070
turn out to be that number but is going

00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:17,330
to be a big number thirty to fifty

00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:19,520
percent of the attendees of those events

00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:21,350
are brand new to puppet and they showed

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,640
up because a friend of theirs or someone

00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:24,320
they know says hey you should go check

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,240
out this puppet thing so they show up

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,130
completely ignorant you know in many

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,990
cases they know roughly what puppet is

00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:34,970
40 it's in the systems world and it's

00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:36,560
spelled pupp ET that's about it right so

00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:39,470
we have to be very comfortable people

00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,120
showing up completely ignorant and we've

00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:42,500
done this we don't have you know much in

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,850
the way of average we have essentially

00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,070
no advertising we've done a little bit

00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:48,650
periodically but not much it's all about

00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:50,810
online engagement and then lots of

00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:54,020
hustling on the ground a lot of time

00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:56,330
that I've spent in the last 28 years has

00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:59,030
been a conference like this walking the

00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:00,860
floor and when I go to conferences you

00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:02,720
know in my opinion expose the the like

00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,010
presentation center in any of you who

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,000
are running the funding for this a

00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:07,220
conference you can close your ears

00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,890
they're kind of useless for community

00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,180
and especially in the early days you

00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,260
know and even when you're really big you

00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:14,990
know we're at this point where we're

00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:17,060
pretty big the show floors are useful as

00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:18,530
a meeting place but like we don't sell

00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,690
things very much there it's a lot more

00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:22,520
like a conversation and some

00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:24,020
storytelling the people who we needed

00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,670
those those expo floors are generally

00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,650
not going to turn into customers very

00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:30,710
quickly I'm going a bit more slowly

00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:32,840
night expected here so when I go to

00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,550
conferences I give talks like this one I

00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,480
run ball off so I do everything I can to

00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,190
get in front of as many people as

00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,660
possible and this is kind of

00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:41,420
controversial I don't ever go to talks I

00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:43,790
just spend all day on the floor hustling

00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:46,030
that's all I did in that process and it

00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:48,500
wasn't about selling I hustled I

00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:49,610
practiced I pitched the story when you

00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,370
go to a hundred people that you don't

00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:54,179
know and you as a geek find the gumption

00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,889
to tell 100 people you've never met

00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:57,600
who are probably as certainly as you are

00:23:55,889 --> 00:23:58,769
hey here's this new project and I'm

00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,820
trying and you should try it out is

00:23:58,769 --> 00:24:01,320
there something I can help you with no

00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:04,649
you hate it and wow that was really

00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,940
painful do that a bunch you'll get good

00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:09,809
at some point you know you just gotta

00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:11,549
gotta keep trying and and when it comes

00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:13,230
to working on the ground it is really

00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:14,700
used to use phul to visit people and

00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,289
that's true whether you're talking in

00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,179
the online community sense go find out

00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:19,559
the communities that you're somewhat

00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:21,690
like that have people that you would

00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,789
like to join your community go find them

00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:25,919
work with them talk to them meet them

00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:27,029
convince them that you have credibility

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,919
and that the stuff you're doing is

00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:31,769
awesome go attend their conferences

00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:34,080
submit talks that should not go I gave a

00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:36,330
talk on what amounted to application of

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,090
theoretical math to development at a

00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:40,499
ruby conference because I was just I was

00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:42,899
just throwing everything out I could out

00:24:40,499 --> 00:24:45,389
to get to get the ability to go you know

00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:47,610
join these communities and when you're

00:24:45,389 --> 00:24:49,919
out at a conference you know you got to

00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,059
work the whole day it's 28 hour days you

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,409
got eight hours at the conference and

00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:55,009
then eight hours of after conference

00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:57,539
events you can sleep when you're home I

00:24:55,009 --> 00:24:59,009
gave talks in five countries in six

00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:01,259
months like I said that that picture

00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:03,179
earlier was from a on the way back from

00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:04,259
India where had given three talks in

00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:07,860
three countries or something like that

00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:09,450
in the space of 11 days my practice my

00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,669
whole this whole time has been to be

00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:13,320
extremely available I have a default

00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:14,610
except on almost everything it's only

00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,740
recently that if random phone numbers

00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:18,960
start if I could get a random call I

00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,490
don't answer it the longest time it was

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,600
you know you could be a key member

00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:23,249
calling from Italy or you could be

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,779
someone who wants to pay me you know for

00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:26,580
a long time the only way to get me the

00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:27,869
only way to buy anything from you was to

00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:30,269
literally call me and say where do i

00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:32,249
send the money because I was I was that

00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:33,990
busy and so that was my sales model is I

00:25:32,249 --> 00:25:36,090
will I will wait until somebody asked me

00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,590
where to send the check so in that case

00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,090
you always want to answer every email

00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:41,490
I've sent for the last eight years it's

00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:43,950
got my my mobile phone number in it it's

00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:46,619
I'm very easy to find I'm still kind of

00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:49,139
haunted by the sound that the colloquy

00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:50,700
IRC application makes when somebody

00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:52,049
mentions my name in IRC because it would

00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,240
you know wake me up from sleep it would

00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:55,740
pull me away from dinner you know if you

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,240
asked any question anywhere if you

00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,379
mentioned my name on the internet I was

00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,230
there to answer your question pretty

00:25:58,379 --> 00:26:02,429
darn quickly so a number of things that

00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:05,009
we've learned in the course of doing

00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:08,000
this that you know we didn't get right

00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:10,910
the first time especially as a company

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,040
one is it is is just difficult to manage

00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:15,340
your organization or your company

00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:18,740
priorities and the community priorities

00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,880
and it's pretty easy to kind of look up

00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,140
in six months and realize that you've

00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,610
been really focused on your internal

00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,380
priorities and the community has been

00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:26,030
outside kind of you know banging on the

00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,200
windows and yelling at you and you

00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,490
haven't noticed because you're too busy

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,550
trying to make it up make enough money

00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:33,650
to feed yourself it's very difficult to

00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:35,180
get this right and the only way we ever

00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,160
got this right in the end was to have

00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:38,570
people who were focused on making sure

00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,280
of the community we're getting the

00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:41,720
support that they needed and this isn't

00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,220
about mollifying right it's not about

00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,900
going to community saying you're special

00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,460
you're attractive we like you it's about

00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,870
really addressing their needs it's about

00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:50,330
making sure the bugs they care most

00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:51,890
deeply about our being fixed in the next

00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:53,270
release it's about making sure that the

00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:54,830
things that are making it difficult for

00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,690
them to convince their bosses to use the

00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:58,580
project are really being worked on it's

00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:00,140
about making sure that the platform they

00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,970
care about the new release of that

00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,680
platform that your product is ready from

00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,940
that new release when it comes out so

00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,460
that when they deploy it into production

00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:09,380
on 10,000 nodes you know they're not

00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,720
going to have problems when you bring it

00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,830
employees into your company they often

00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,140
don't get community they don't know why

00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:18,110
it matters they don't care about it you

00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:20,270
have to find a way to convince them to

00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:21,530
teach them about community or you have

00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:23,090
to get them away from your community

00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:25,280
there are in especially in companies

00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:26,330
replaces your employees who don't need

00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,550
to care about community they don't need

00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:29,570
to be great at it and if you have a but

00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:31,130
if you have an employer who's supposed

00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:32,390
to care about community they better be

00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:34,220
good at it you have to actually you know

00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:36,140
one of our onboarding process part of

00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:39,920
our onboarding process is helping our

00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:45,430
employees understand the value and work

00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:47,840
done in the community it's very tempting

00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:49,040
and we've done this you know a lot of

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,050
open source communities do this

00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,850
differently but we work hard not to

00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:55,520
announce things to our community we made

00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:56,990
this mistake periodically and it's

00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,160
really important to say you know here's

00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:59,690
this thing that we're thinking about

00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,850
doing here's this thing that we expect

00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:03,830
to do in a month or you know if it's a

00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:05,660
small thing in a week or tomorrow and

00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:06,890
give a chance to say for the community

00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,630
to say we think this is the horrible

00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:10,970
idea or hey is there some way I can help

00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:12,470
or hey you've missed this edge case

00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:14,780
that's actually pretty important what

00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:17,420
you want to do about that big changes

00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:19,100
need lots of warning when we change the

00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,810
license of puppet I had been talking

00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,720
about it publicly at events and on the

00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:23,610
lists and in

00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,440
it's for literally more than a year and

00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:27,210
it took us six months of a lot of other

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,980
things to make that happen so you need a

00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:30,810
lot of notice and you need to listen

00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,160
it's not enough to say by the way next

00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,510
week we're going to do this and then you

00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,770
know you go on vacation for a week you

00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:37,230
come back next week and then you do that

00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:38,790
you have to engage right you have to put

00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:40,470
it out there have a conversation about

00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,820
it and and if you don't get any

00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,530
responses if you post this thing and

00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,790
nobody says anything you probably did

00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:47,250
something wrong you have to get somebody

00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:48,990
to say I heard you and I think this is a

00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,830
decent idea or at least I'm not going to

00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,530
come and throw a Molotov cocktail

00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:55,680
through your window hypothetically

00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:57,480
speaking so I wanted to talk through

00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,960
some of the large changes that we made

00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:04,260
in our community that it I think we're

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,700
pretty successful and that there were

00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,080
times where it was tempting to get it

00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,000
wrong there were times where I said you

00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:13,920
know what I want to do this and then I

00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:16,380
went that's probably stupid so one day

00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,850
this guy this Australian again I

00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,890
mentioned Australia is full of good

00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:20,970
society means I have no idea why the sky

00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,560
James Turnbull shows up and he goes hey

00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:24,600
I'm gonna write a public pool can I was

00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,950
like uh-uh you don't know anything about

00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:30,060
puppet plus i'm going to write the

00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:32,850
puppet book and and then i went wait i

00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:36,540
worked like 80 hours a week never try to

00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:37,590
pop a book also our Doc's gonna suck so

00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,440
I went to when I said oh how about this

00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:43,290
all answer any question you ask if in

00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,940
exchange you always update the docs and

00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:46,350
if you use all that in a book too that's

00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,430
fine I don't care if you profit on it

00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,660
because everyone knows that people write

00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:53,490
technical looks for profit right

00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:55,200
everyone knows that exactly I'll help

00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:56,370
you with your book but in exchange you

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,810
have to do something for our community

00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:59,280
you have to update all those dogs so by

00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:01,020
the time you've written that book he'd

00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,910
also completely rewritten our dogs and

00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,560
he's gotten so engaged in the community

00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:06,600
and he was all those people who before

00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,190
too long you know anybody any question

00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,560
answered on the on the the channel or on

00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:13,980
the list he can answer as as well and as

00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:15,450
quickly as I could so this was all those

00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,250
transitions were at first I had this

00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:18,690
desire to say no this is the thing that

00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,130
I'm going to I'm going to be the author

00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:22,410
of the puppet book because I want that

00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:24,810
and then I went that's never going to

00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:29,700
happen and it actually worked out really

00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:32,430
really well for us like I mentioned

00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,200
earlier in 2009 my company took venture

00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:35,700
capital

00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,020
and you know I'm sure many of you have

00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,880
been in open source communities where

00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:41,130
this happens there are a lot of ways for

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,420
this to go wrong one of the ways in

00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,440
which went right one of the reasons it

00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,900
worked out well for us I mean there are

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,300
two major reasons one is again my

00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:50,010
company Mike my community knew what I

00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:52,950
was doing they knew why I was doing it

00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:54,600
and so no one was surprised that I was

00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:56,520
trying to grow the company and to his

00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,650
everyone had seen me hustling for four

00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:00,510
years right they'd seen me out trying to

00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:02,250
do this and they'd seen frankly that I

00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,630
was I was really struggling I you know I

00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:05,730
I mean come there's a company here in

00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:07,890
town JAMA software and the founders been

00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:09,210
able to grow it to 70 people without

00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,650
taking any venture capital and I just

00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,240
feel like that's so impressive because I

00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:14,430
tried that for four years and I did not

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,110
succeed by the end of four years I was

00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:17,820
three people I needed to help i need the

00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:20,490
investment tool to grow the way that

00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,500
we've been able to grow since then and

00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:23,730
so they knew i wasn't selling out they

00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,140
knew i was doing this to hire more

00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:27,240
programmers and that's what I began

00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:30,030
doing right away I think the biggest

00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:33,210
change we made was in 2011 we switched

00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:36,210
from the GPL to the apache license and

00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:37,920
out of the you know three thousand or so

00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:41,160
people in our community at this time we

00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:42,690
had two people complain and you know to

00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,250
give you a sense of what that looks like

00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:45,900
one of those people's Nick's nickname on

00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:48,060
IRC is windows refund so you could tell

00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:50,820
he was going to be you know he was he

00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:52,410
already had a position in terms of what

00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,780
the light right license wasn't and how

00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:57,030
did how to do this and the reason why

00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:59,220
this works so well is we were again I

00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:01,290
began really really early i spent more

00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,430
than a year working with the community

00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,450
not even announcing it just saying hey

00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:05,760
here's the thing we think we're going to

00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:07,680
do and then we spent six months directly

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,520
engaging giving all the clas on getting

00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,040
to the point where we could make this

00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:13,710
license change and we were very clear

00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:15,150
about why some of it was you know yes we

00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:17,760
want to grow our company we think the

00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:20,310
right way to grow our company is to have

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,930
more of a focus on integrations we think

00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,760
you know with a GPL you have a little

00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:25,560
bit more likelihood of license revenue

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,970
but fewer people are going to integrate

00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,410
with your software with the Apache

00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:30,120
License you're more likely to have

00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:31,260
product integrations but you're not

00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,700
really going to be able to make the same

00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,890
kind of you can't rely since your

00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,900
product for revenue at least not as

00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:38,490
easily and we went to our committee said

00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,770
hey we think this is why we think this

00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:42,270
change makes sense and you know in

00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:43,170
either case you could say this is going

00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,280
to grow my company in a certain way

00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,590
that's going to grow my company in a

00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,970
certain way at the time we felt like the

00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,380
MySQL Tucson to Oracle

00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:52,410
transition had kind of poisoned the well

00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:53,880
for GPL as a route to license revenue

00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:55,200
and that's certainly what we had found

00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,490
in trying to work with partners we go

00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,600
talk to partners and they would say I'm

00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:59,160
sorry I can't integrate with your

00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,540
software it's GPL door you know not

00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,830
can't but you know my lawyer is when i

00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,720
call them they froth at the mouth and

00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:05,850
the LME and so I'm not going to do this

00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,680
it was absolutely not a religious

00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:09,510
conversation for us and that meant that

00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,880
when we talked to our community we were

00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:13,710
able to make that conversation entirely

00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,390
non-elite I can't except for two people

00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:17,940
I had one the other person I can

00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:19,470
remember when I changed license emailed

00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,660
me and said why are you forking the

00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:24,960
puppet project and I said thank you

00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:26,820
tactically you've got that all wrong so

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,320
it was it was a great transition and

00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,120
this is you know to me I look at this

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,270
and say the fact that we navigated this

00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:35,940
and not not only still have a great

00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:37,470
community but have seen continued very

00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,180
strong growth since then I feel like

00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:41,310
it's a great testament to the strength

00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:43,110
of the community even though it's a

00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:45,900
vendor driven community even though you

00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:47,700
know you know all those things so I've

00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:50,850
left I think about seven minutes for

00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:53,420
questions told you I have twins this is

00:33:50,850 --> 00:34:01,230
a how they get the school periodically

00:33:53,420 --> 00:34:02,370
so any questions oh good hate standing

00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:07,530
here awkwardly for seven minutes on

00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:09,000
nobody asked me anything yes thanks Luke

00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:11,280
I wondered one of the differences

00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,410
perhaps between the puppet community in

00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,040
the Apache community is that the Apache

00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:18,870
community is actually a Federation of

00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:21,840
different projects do you have any

00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:25,880
advice for having the projects he'll

00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:28,290
work together on community development

00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:31,560
yeah that's a great question I i mean i

00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:33,180
think when when I was approached about

00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,700
giving a talk about community Apache

00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:37,230
project I was like really I don't think

00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,460
I have anything to teach those people

00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:42,150
out community I think it's the other way

00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:43,560
around so a lot of ways I i think the

00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:46,590
apache community is a great example of

00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,700
how to do community and so there aren't

00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:49,020
a lot of things that i can say you know

00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:53,250
hey you should do this differently or

00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:55,170
something like that to me communities

00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:57,540
about identity and so the big question

00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:59,220
becomes what is what is the shared

00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:02,130
identity across each project what is it

00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:03,960
about the apache community that

00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:05,850
provides an identity for the people who

00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,800
are members of that community there's a

00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:08,970
reason why there's not really a Windows

00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,560
community there's a reason why there's

00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:12,000
not you know there's a lot of things

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:15,150
that that kind of everyone has that

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,380
right and at this point enough people

00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:18,270
using Mac's now that there's not really

00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,590
a Mac community as much right you have

00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,910
to find a small enough group of people

00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:23,430
that they have some sense of identity

00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:25,290
away from the the mass groups around

00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:27,030
them so you know the big thing that I

00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:29,040
would be looking at is if it's not the

00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:31,170
piece of software using what is the

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,430
shared sense of identity that people who

00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,430
are members of the Apache community have

00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:41,280
okay thanks yeah great talk quick

00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:43,740
question so if you talk about us the

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,680
change of a licensing from GPA or two

00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:48,720
Apache my understanding is in in most of

00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,610
us but apache license actually more

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,890
linear to compare with GPR it gives you

00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:55,140
more freedom so I'm just curious what

00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:58,220
are the concerns those people have when

00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:00,300
you made this transition yeah so um

00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:02,910
absolutely apache license is more

00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,260
lenient and the big concerns and one

00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:06,930
things that i found most frustrating

00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:09,090
about this is there are a lot of lawyers

00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:11,700
who will happily give you advice that is

00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:16,290
completely useless but at least it's

00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:18,510
expensive and almost everyone I talked

00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:20,820
to you who's a lawyer was essentially

00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:24,090
like their basic response was you should

00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:25,560
be very afraid and so when I go talk to

00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,970
a company about you know hey you should

00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,410
build this integration or you know you

00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:31,200
should even run my software on your on

00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:32,790
your hardware they would go I don't know

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,660
I've talked to my lawyers and they've

00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:37,860
said I should be very afraid and what

00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:41,910
the lawyers seem to have learned is that

00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:43,140
Apache essentially has no it can't force

00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:44,700
you to do anything else it gives you

00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,800
rights to use the project but it doesn't

00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:49,140
force you as the user or as the

00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,790
developer to do anything else and the

00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,830
GPL and there are lot of things that

00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:55,470
that are frankly on the answered about

00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:57,650
the GPL in law there are things that we

00:36:55,470 --> 00:37:02,520
actually we literally don't know about

00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:03,840
what triggers the G pls I don't there

00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,040
are ways and I'm not supposed to talk

00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,660
about it on stage whatever that

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,710
provision is called that causes you to

00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,810
have to open source your own software

00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:12,570
that that provision getting triggered

00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:14,340
literally the lawyers don't know what

00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:15,750
triggers it so if I've got a pro library

00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,100
and I ship another pro library

00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:19,470
that you know those are things that no

00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:21,450
one really knows and so that uncertainty

00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,770
causes a lot of lawyers especially a big

00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:24,300
companies Cisco and VMware both

00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:26,460
investors in mind at this point you know

00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,770
their lawyers were completely unwilling

00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:30,060
to sanction there are people integrating

00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:32,670
with a GPL project cuz they they

00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,840
literally couldn't tell you whether as a

00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,730
result they would have to open source

00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:38,730
something crazy and Cisco you know they

00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:41,310
made some mistakes on some of their GPL

00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:43,890
software as part of the linksys project

00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:45,240
linksys routers and so they got really

00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:47,430
burned by that in terms of they made

00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,170
this mistake and what they learned was

00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:51,450
the easiest way to solve this is just to

00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:52,710
not use GPL to use apache rather than

00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:54,030
expecting all their employees to

00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:57,330
understand the nuance of what they can

00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:58,170
and can't do and again since you know

00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:00,020
some of these things are literally

00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:02,760
undecided there were questions about

00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:05,070
what we had to open source that I

00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,090
couldn't find again the only place I

00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:08,850
could find it was you should be very

00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:11,070
afraid and so rather than having to be

00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:14,730
afraid all the time which I frankly

00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:19,860
still do but not for that reason we just

00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:22,190
decided switch licenses neither

00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,190
questions

00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:32,790
perhaps the Portland beer is taking its

00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:34,560
effect I know a number of people went

00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:36,360
out and had a good time last night yeah

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:40,620
the coveted 9am talked in the last day

00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:42,420
of the conference I think you know yes

00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:44,010
the only the only better slot is

00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:47,130
immediately after one of our rather good

00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:48,480
lunches when the blood the blood there's

00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:50,460
a fight between the stomach and the

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,520
brain for the bloodstream the coveted

00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:56,070
lunch spot the graveyard of the

00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,630
speaker's world ok well if nobody else

00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:00,450
has any questions then I just like to

00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:02,600
say thank you very much Luka nice thank

00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:02,600
