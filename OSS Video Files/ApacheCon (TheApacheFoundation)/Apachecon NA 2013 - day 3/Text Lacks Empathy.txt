okay good morning ladies and gentlemen

00:00:02,659 --> 00:00:07,319
my name is Noreen and I'm here to talk

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,849
about text likes empathy looks like

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:13,080
there's a lot of you doing text at the

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:16,740
moment no it takes a while to wake up

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,300
but that's alright we are all more or

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,060
less you know to varying degrees

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,160
hairless monkeys we've evolved to be

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,439
very social creatures and there are

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,650
actually special parts of our brain that

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,529
are dedicated to recognizing faces even

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,420
in people who have face blindness and so

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:36,090
they don't connect the faces with the

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,090
people that they know those areas of the

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,800
brain light up when they see pictures of

00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,809
human faces in a way that they don't

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,980
when they see a picture of a car or duck

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:48,989
or something else monkeys keep their

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,170
social groups together by grooming each

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,520
other by picking fleas off each other

00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:57,350
humans have much bigger social groups

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,489
and slightly different hygiene mores a

00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:02,309
conservative estimate puts the mean at

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:05,760
about a hundred and fifty people groups

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:08,850
for humans whereas the next biggest

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:13,820
social group within the primates have

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:16,320
about 60 individuals per social group

00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:19,259
language is what enables us to have

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,390
bigger social groups and it enables us

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:24,590
to communicate about what we need but

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:27,509
also about how we're feeling empathy

00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:31,970
comes when you translate it into German

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:34,740
is I'm foolin so it's 19 fulong feeling

00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:38,000
and it's this sense of connecting with

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,290
other people and sharing the one feeling

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,060
understanding what they are feeling and

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,119
transmitting to them what you are

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,070
feeling the OED describes it as the

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,399
power of projecting one's personality

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,890
into and so fully comprehending the

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,810
object of contemplation I've never

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:58,020
gotten quite that far myself but it's a

00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,270
nice ideal the only problem is that a

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:05,369
lot of our online communication lacks

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:07,229
empathy this is a commercial that will

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:09,629
show you what happens when the emotion

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,410
is removed from a conversation I can

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,410
just get it play

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,810
don't give me that where's your wife

00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,810
wolf it down for breakfast

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:31,519
that came out wrong so don't know if you

00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:34,760
got that but when you when you remove

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:38,180
the communication of yes that was funny

00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,980
I got the joke suddenly what was a joke

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,230
between two people who seem to know each

00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,000
other well have a good relationship

00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:47,690
becomes this oh my god what's just

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,420
happened unfortunately when there's an

00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:53,209
emotional void we have a tendency to

00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:55,280
fill it with negative emotions and the

00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:57,680
more important the conversation is the

00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,440
more stress were under the more likely

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,760
we are to do this so if you've ever

00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:07,640
gotten an email like this as your

00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,610
reaction oh boy I'm getting a raise it's

00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:17,000
going to be great or is it oh what

00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:19,760
did I do the problem with this is as I

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,310
said text likes empathy communication is

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,170
about words but it's also about the

00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:27,410
emotions that are backing those words

00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:30,620
and a lot of content is conveyed outside

00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:33,530
of the words that we use I was a

00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,180
linguistic student and so I've spent a

00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,880
lot of my career looking at sentences

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,889
like this and part of the reason that

00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,840
this sentence is hard to understand is

00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:44,299
because we've removed some of the

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,030
context there are a couple of ways of

00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:50,840
putting the context back in we can do

00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:54,560
pictures or we can make the words

00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,180
clearer this expansion is slightly bogus

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,609
for any linguists actually looking at it

00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,160
but it's hard to draw a parse tree in

00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:04,430
ascii art on a slide at a size that

00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,440
you'll actually be able to read it so

00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:09,889
the ship shipping ships phrase is

00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,810
missing linguistic content because ship

00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:15,500
can be a verb or a noun and we don't

00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:17,120
mark that in English it's ambiguous but

00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,340
there are other kinds of context that we

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,349
can be missing do we have any other

00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:25,400
writers in the room we have at least a

00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:26,840
couple I'm a technical writer by day and

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,700
I work on a team with two other writers

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,610
in a company with a few dozen engineers

00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:35,520
and when I write something it basically

00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:38,699
goes research draft read edit

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,280
read ask somebody else to read ask an

00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:47,550
expert to read let us ask a non-expert

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:50,580
to read edit read head of publish does

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:53,159
anybody write emails like that I don't

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,300
even even when I'm being good and I

00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:56,610
write the email and then I wait

00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,530
overnight and I send it then like I

00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,680
don't go through a full writing process

00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:03,840
when I'm when I'm communicating on a lot

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,030
of my open source projects and that's

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,490
fine if you're just sharing pictures of

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:12,840
ponies but when you're trying to solve

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:15,419
complex technical or social problems it

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,310
doesn't work there those edits actually

00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:20,819
have a purpose and it's not just to keep

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:23,220
the engineers busy some of those edits

00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:25,979
clarify content that's why we have an

00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,080
expert in a non-expert read things some

00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:30,120
of them change the register so whether

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,440
I'm talking very formally about

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,120
something which might be saying a white

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,440
paper or whether I'm talking more

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,270
informally in an email or a help article

00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:42,569
and when I'm sending email some of or

00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:44,370
when I'm sending you know emotive

00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:46,409
content some of those edits put that

00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,719
emotion back in they try to evoke

00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:51,810
empathy they try to get the reader on

00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:53,669
side make them feel happy make them feel

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:58,229
like this is something we can do

00:05:53,669 --> 00:06:00,120
positive all of that as I said the

00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:04,139
problem is that most of us don't

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:08,580
actually write our emails we talk with

00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:11,130
our fingers trained writers can inject

00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:14,069
emotion into text we work very hard at

00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:16,469
it it's not an easy thing to do we think

00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:18,120
about our audience and what mindset they

00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:22,349
might be in and what mindset we want

00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:25,139
them to be in but most people write on

00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:27,210
IM and an email in a very similar way to

00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:29,039
the way that they speak and you'll

00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,630
you'll recognize this when you get

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,099
emails from particular people and you're

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,680
reading the email and you can actually

00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:38,909
hear that person yelling you out or

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,830
encouraging you or whatever it is but

00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:43,080
when we speak we rely on having all of

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:46,110
these extra dimensions of communication

00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,599
all of these emotional side channels and

00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,900
without realizing it when we're sending

00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:51,840
email

00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,600
l or instant messages those are gone and

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,880
it can drastically alter the meaning and

00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,330
we don't necessarily know why or what's

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:03,360
gone wrong a sentence like this looks

00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:06,509
much less ambiguous than the ship

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,120
shipping chips but it's not there are

00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:12,000
seven different ways that I can read

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,270
that sentence I didn't say you stole my

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,990
money Jane said it I didn't say you

00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:21,479
stole my money I wasn't talking I didn't

00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:24,389
say you stole my money but it sure looks

00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:28,199
like it I didn't say you stole my money

00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:30,650
Mike did I didn't say you stole my money

00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,660
I just think you spent it poorly I

00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:36,180
didn't say you stole my money that was

00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:40,650
bills and I didn't say you stole my

00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:43,229
money it's my laptop that's gone so each

00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,940
of those different readings how do you

00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:49,020
tell the difference between them when

00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:52,800
it's a text putting the emphasis on the

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:54,030
Rights allowable works in voice but

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,240
there are other things that we need to

00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:58,680
have to we have tone of voice so if

00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,300
somebody says to me am i pronouncing

00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:05,909
your name right and I say sure it's fine

00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,740
versus if I say sure it's fine it's a

00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:10,139
very different communication it's a very

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:14,310
different message that they receive but

00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:16,740
if I right sure it's fine what have you

00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:19,080
got as I said when we have these

00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:24,240
emotional voids we tend to fill them

00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:27,360
with negatives when we're face to face

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,949
we've got expressions i can see whether

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,240
you're looking at your laptops are

00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:33,089
looking at me I can see whether you're

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,339
looking confused or interested sometimes

00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:37,560
I get this wrong I've had people sitting

00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:39,630
in talks I had one guy at one point he

00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,520
was looking really really angry and I

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,770
thought what have I done what have I

00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:48,930
said and it turned out that was just his

00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:51,120
interested face we have hand movements I

00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:53,220
don't I don't know whether any of you

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,339
have been watching my hands but I talk a

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,200
lot with my hands you know if I have to

00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,600
keep my hands by my side suddenly my

00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,820
brain in a certain sense doesn't doesn't

00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,920
quite work the same way

00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:07,820
and it's much harder to get the words

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:10,580
out we have physical position and body

00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:12,380
language and there are cultural variants

00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:15,500
in these but they are so important

00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:17,390
they're so strong they're so tuned to

00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,130
look for them that we actually see them

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:22,670
in things and in animals that don't have

00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:24,950
them okay you look at this and you

00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:28,370
recognize you know I'm the king of the

00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:32,570
world but I couldn't even tell you what

00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:35,180
kind of an animal that is what did we

00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:38,380
say it's an anteater okay I don't think

00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,380
we have anteaters in Ireland

00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,690
historically our online communities have

00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:46,640
tended to be a social skills free zone

00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:49,640
often deliberately so we excuse

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,190
awkwardness or even rudeness with labels

00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,920
like autism and Asperger's but actually

00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:57,440
this talk isn't about neurodiversity but

00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,620
we can learn a lot from the autistic and

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,720
asperous community and one of the things

00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,310
we learn is that having those things is

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,390
not the same as having poor social

00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:10,550
skills like anything else people all

00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,260
kinds of people learn these things and

00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,930
the same way that we learn to read and

00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:16,700
write we also learn social skills we

00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:18,400
learn them growing up we learn very

00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,130
different social skills in different

00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,450
cultures and communities and countries

00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:26,480
and it's easier for some people than

00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:28,970
others but even if you have a learning

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,500
disability whether it's dyslexia whether

00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,870
it's you know you're not very good at

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,330
pointers whatever it is you can still

00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:38,150
learn these things I know this can be

00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:40,100
done because I've done it myself if you

00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:43,100
are at the bar camp tonight last night

00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:47,840
you might not actually believe it but

00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:50,570
I'm serious introvert I know I know I

00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,670
have learned all this stuff in the same

00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:55,160
way that I've learnt to write it's

00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,930
something you practice you go on you

00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,390
practice you go on you practice you go

00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,830
on and you get to a point where you find

00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:03,470
standing up in front of a room of people

00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:06,350
and ad-libbing silly things about tort

00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,910
proposals when I was a teenager I used

00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,550
to come home from school and my mom

00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:11,810
would ask how was your day and I didn't

00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,550
always want to talk about it but you

00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,110
know she would ask and so I would tell

00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:17,079
her

00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,970
and I just assumed that if she wanted to

00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:22,149
tell me about her day she would tell me

00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:24,570
about her day but she would get quite

00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:26,680
hurt that I didn't ask how her day was

00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:29,440
because I was making this assumption

00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:32,200
that well if she wants to tell me she'll

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,170
tell me and for her it was part of a

00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,640
social interaction that I should say my

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,810
day was great and I did this and that

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,670
and how was your day mom and those are

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:45,880
just rules that we can learn we can do

00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:50,470
this as a like social code really there

00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:52,000
are steps you can take but learning all

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,519
of these rules is a process it's a

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,029
continual process sometimes it's really

00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,140
exhausting I kind of say that when I'm

00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:03,550
in a large group I'm running on

00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:06,519
emulations so I can be extroverted and

00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:08,529
have this bubbly personality but it's

00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:09,760
not that I'm hardwired to be that way

00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:13,060
it's that I've learnt to be that way and

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,579
i practice being that way this talk is

00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:19,720
not remedial geek socialization although

00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:22,360
I have done that one before but it's

00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,740
also for people who are naturally good

00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,019
at those things and naturally good

00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:29,560
communicators it's useful to see from

00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:31,290
the other side to see how people are

00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,620
thinking to see how those

00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:36,579
miscommunications are coming about and

00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,550
hopefully you'll learn a little bit

00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:41,079
about how to correct for those and the

00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,720
special cases that come with online

00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:45,100
communication so Before we jump into the

00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,180
second half of the top where we're going

00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:51,070
to talk about some of those strategies

00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:53,860
is overly with me so far excellent if

00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,620
you have questions at any point just put

00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:58,540
up your hand wave whatever it is and

00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:02,459
I'll take them as we go along if I'm

00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:05,740
going too fast also please let me know

00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:08,980
so are any of you familiar with oblique

00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,480
strategies it used to be a deck of cards

00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,899
and now it's an app you can have on your

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,910
phone and it's designed to help you with

00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:17,589
creative thinking so when you're stuck

00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,420
on a problem you pull a card off the

00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:22,000
deck and they have these oblique

00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:24,520
strategies like look at it from the

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,600
outside or do nothing for as long as

00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:31,430
possible listen to the quiet voice

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:34,079
and they're not really advice so much as

00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:36,779
reminding you of ways to think about the

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:40,800
problem and so here are some oblique

00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:42,899
strategies for online communication the

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:47,910
first one is tacked filters how many of

00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:51,000
you have heard of this really one or two

00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:53,759
okay Jeff Bigler came up with this in

00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,680
the early 90s when a friend of his who

00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,199
was at MIT was regularly finding herself

00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:02,399
upset by other people who are working in

00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:04,290
her lab and the idea is that you can put

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,240
these filters you can put tact filters

00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,759
on the output when you're speaking you

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,410
can be polite and nice and you know

00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:12,810
preface your comments with how are you

00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:15,810
and things like that or you can put it

00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:18,060
on your input when you're listening and

00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:21,000
just assume that when somebody says here

00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:24,389
give me that what they mean is do you

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,279
mind if I borrow your VGA dongle the

00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:28,350
problem is that geeks have this tendency

00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:31,230
to use tact filters differently from

00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:32,939
other people ordinary people put tacked

00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:35,040
on their output and they expect their

00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:38,730
input to come pre-filtered with

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:42,209
politeness whereas geeks tend to put

00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:43,949
tacked on their input and we expect that

00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:46,589
you know this person isn't actually

00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:48,449
meaning to be a jerk that's fine you

00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:50,880
know we're we're all just getting it

00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:54,660
done as efficiently as possible the

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:57,480
problem is when a geek and a ordinary

00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,990
person talk then there's no tact and the

00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:03,089
geek comes off as really rude and

00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:06,860
conversely when it goes the other way

00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:09,180
around there's all this tact and some

00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:11,639
normal person saying please and thank

00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:13,170
you and being very polite and the geeks

00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:19,620
thinking won't they just get to the damn

00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:21,180
point so what we can learn from this is

00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,600
just adjust your attacked to the

00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:27,870
audience on a mailing list that might be

00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,759
you know reading a few posts lurking for

00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:32,399
a while till you figure out what is the

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,829
baseline here at a party it's

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,269
conversation surfing just hang out in a

00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:38,639
few different conversations see where

00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:40,800
people are going and it takes a little

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,810
bit of work and it's not always

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,080
obvious you know even after you have

00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:47,940
listened for a while but a default a

00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,279
good default is always to have a little

00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:54,180
bit of tact on your output but also on

00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:57,420
your input and you can you can template

00:15:54,180 --> 00:16:02,910
this here's here's an email tact

00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:04,110
template hello name all the things I had

00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:07,649
written in this email that I was going

00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:10,649
to say anyway thanks Noreen like it's

00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:12,269
it's that simple it's it's put that line

00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:14,130
at the top but those two lines at the

00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:17,490
bottom and leave the rest of your email

00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:19,079
as it was and suddenly you've got a

00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,209
little bit of tact you have this sense

00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:23,339
that okay this person is not just

00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:25,860
bombarding me with questions or

00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:27,390
suggestions of bug reports but we're

00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:31,380
actually having a conversation and a

00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:34,140
communication even if you wanted to

00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:37,769
throw a few extra pleases in that

00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:39,870
usually works great too and even the

00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:41,490
most tactless geek can strip this

00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:44,670
template off they can just ignore the

00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:47,310
first line and ignore that so you end up

00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:50,570
hopefully balancing your tact a little

00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:54,270
bit better with your with your audience

00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:56,370
perception is reality it doesn't

00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:59,459
actually matter whether you intended to

00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:01,740
attack somebody or not if they read your

00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:03,329
email and they feel attacked that's

00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:07,559
their reality and they're no longer

00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:10,199
listening to what you're saying you have

00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:12,480
to help them understand that that was

00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,730
not your intention before you can

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,800
actually get to dealing with whatever

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:19,589
the technical content of of your

00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:22,470
communication was so listen to what's

00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:25,230
said and try not to second-guess those

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:28,010
emotional voids rather than filling them

00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:30,300
try to actually communicate and say hey

00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:36,090
this seemed like you were really cross

00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:38,490
with me about this what's going on a

00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:42,120
sort of a tan gentle to that is set

00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:44,070
expectations and don't just disappear if

00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,620
you just if you're having a conversation

00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:50,780
with somebody and suddenly it's five

00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,780
o'clock it's Friday great pub time

00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:57,960
and the conversation is gone and they're

00:17:55,499 --> 00:18:01,799
going did I liked it I really upset him

00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,929
or what went on there let people know

00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:05,999
what's going on say you know send them

00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:09,059
an email and say yeah it's it's half for

00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:10,559
here on Friday I'm looking forward to

00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:12,149
hearing what you have to say about this

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,970
but I might not go back to you until

00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:19,470
Monday yeah I'm going on holidays for a

00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:21,960
week if i don't reply that's why this is

00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:24,059
sort of a kindergarten level one the

00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,830
other person doesn't actually know how

00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:28,350
you feel they are not inside your brain

00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:30,090
they do not know all the things that you

00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:33,240
know they do not know all the things

00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:35,759
that are going on in your life they

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,889
can't hear you they don't know if if you

00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:42,509
are annoyed because the cat just won't

00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:44,700
decide whether it wants in or out when

00:18:42,509 --> 00:18:47,970
we speak we rely on all of those extra

00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,769
emotional side channels and without

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,509
realizing it they're gone and that can

00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:54,749
drastically alter the meaning of what

00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:57,299
we're saying so we have to try and bring

00:18:54,749 --> 00:19:00,119
those channels back and sometimes that

00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:03,330
can seem awkward at first how many of

00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:05,639
you played mass effect two there's a

00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:08,639
species called the elk or that

00:19:05,639 --> 00:19:11,899
communicate that all of their emotions

00:19:08,639 --> 00:19:14,940
using these very very subtle sense and

00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:16,889
infrasound vibrations and and so to

00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:20,220
humans they sound completely flat in

00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:23,749
monotone so here we have a little clip

00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,749
if i can get mouse over that place

00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:51,690
now the insincere endorsement sounds

00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:53,490
pretty insincere to us anyway but the

00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,650
point is that that the elk or have

00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:58,790
learned that they have to preface their

00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:03,690
statements with an emotive to say

00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:07,920
insincere endorsement or happily or with

00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:09,510
great affection because to to to their

00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:14,250
listeners all of these things sound the

00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:16,530
same and they don't sound positive so

00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:18,630
state your emotions if a conversation

00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:21,660
over text isn't going well and you can't

00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:23,430
figure out why state your emotions and

00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,710
state your assumptions tell the other

00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:28,140
person what you're hearing it can be as

00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:31,800
simple as saying I'm pissed off about

00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:33,680
this or this makes me happy but when I

00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:38,130
find myself using most often is

00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:41,010
sincerely or honestly because people can

00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:43,620
think particularly when you say yeah you

00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:45,720
should go ahead and do that it can often

00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,430
be taken as this that's a stupid idea

00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,670
and I have no intention of being

00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:52,920
involved with it where is what it more

00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:55,350
often means for me is that's a really

00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,940
good idea and I'm working on all of

00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:59,220
these other things and I don't have time

00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:03,510
to help you with it but you should go

00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:05,460
ahead and do it and so saying honestly I

00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:07,140
think that's a really good idea rather

00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:11,580
than just saying yeah I think that's a

00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:13,500
really good idea it puts that but

00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:16,710
emotion back in that you don't have in

00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,730
the text and it can be a revelation for

00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,800
the other side that drags the

00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:21,810
conversation back on track when they

00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,030
realize that actually you're happy about

00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:28,290
this or you're annoyed about it or

00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:30,270
whatever it is a taught a tool we have

00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:33,270
from the world of non-violent

00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:35,460
communication which is sort of i always

00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:37,170
find a funny i mean is the rest of our

00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:40,230
communication really violent no

00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:42,020
hopefully not but paraphrasing this is

00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:44,480
essentially error checking this is

00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:46,310
this is your your control bit for the

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,190
human language somebody says something

00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:51,890
to you and you say you tell them back

00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:53,240
the summary of what you heard so that

00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:58,190
they have an opportunity to say wait

00:21:53,240 --> 00:22:01,160
that's that's not what I meant at all so

00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:03,920
if you if somebody says to you somebody

00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,270
said to me the other night oh is that

00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,600
going to be your tagline for the next

00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:10,670
five years and I was kind of hurt by

00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,980
that and I sent them an email and I said

00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:14,900
look you know when you said that I

00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,550
thought you were being really dismissive

00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,660
and I actually care about the issue we

00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:23,450
were talking about and he said no no

00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:26,360
what I meant was are you going to be

00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:27,590
working on this like on an ongoing basis

00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:31,010
because I think it's something that

00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:33,800
needs to be worked on and so we went

00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:38,000
from me feeling really hurt and him

00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:40,160
going why did she just puff off to okay

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,890
we're friends again now we can figure

00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,180
this out you know he's not necessarily

00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,880
interested in working in the same things

00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:48,680
I am but at least i know he's supportive

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:53,600
of what i'm doing and and that kind of

00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:56,750
thing these are some of my favorite ways

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:59,570
of getting communication and exam

00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:02,180
empathy into text some people consider

00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:04,280
emoticons kind of childish i think

00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:07,040
they're actually really powerful compact

00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,870
indicators of emotion for those of you

00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:11,660
who aren't familiar with this one it's

00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:16,010
flipping flipping a table so when you're

00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:18,530
really really annoyed like just it it's

00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:21,890
maybe not the very clearest example but

00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:26,740
i think it's kind of funny you see it

00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:26,740
you see the little guy and the yeah okay

00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,630
do we have any more do I have any

00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:36,050
questions or we all still on track

00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:38,030
excellent another idea fill in the

00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:42,080
blanks as I said as we saw in the video

00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:45,860
with the butcher these emotional voids

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,540
are there the human tendency is to fill

00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:51,250
them with negative emotion don't do that

00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:54,530
and don't project your own emotions ask

00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:56,870
clarify assume good intent as

00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:58,850
said in his keynote I'd much rather you

00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:02,600
thought I was stupid than thought I was

00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:05,000
evil point out when you think you're

00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:07,580
missing something I can't tell whether

00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,650
you like this idea or not I don't know

00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,500
whether whether you're supportive or

00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:15,890
whether you think I'm being stupid here

00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:18,200
and when you detect sarcasm because it's

00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:22,520
not going to be an F respond with

00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:27,710
sincerity if somebody is being a jerk be

00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:29,420
nice to them being a jerk to them if you

00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:32,480
if you haven't tried it I'm sure you've

00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:35,060
at least seen it has it worked has it

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,070
ever worked has being a jerk to somebody

00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:39,380
as being a jerk ever made the

00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:40,880
conversation more productive because

00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:44,720
I've never seen it make conversation

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:47,960
more productive so be nice and I know

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,530
it's hard and and have friends you can

00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:53,600
go to and go that guy is being an idiot

00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:56,570
that's fine but do that off channel with

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,310
somebody else and in the converse in the

00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:03,040
technical conversations and in your

00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:05,810
emails try and be nicer than they are

00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:10,460
there there's a technical community here

00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:14,410
in Portland where we the women women get

00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:16,220
together and and often starts off with

00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:17,630
complaining about things we've had to

00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,180
put up with in the workplace and that

00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:21,920
kind of thing and the strategy that

00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:25,640
we've come up with is trying to out nice

00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:28,400
people I once you once you start trying

00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,170
to out nice somebody it turns out that

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,530
they often find that they're responding

00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:36,470
in kind and and it becomes this you know

00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:39,290
let's okay let's work together let's get

00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:44,420
this done let's lean in rather than

00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:47,800
leaning out sometimes no matter what you

00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:50,180
do is your text it's just not working

00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,520
and those are the times it's good to

00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:57,620
increase the empathic increase the

00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:59,750
emotional bandwidth I hesitate to say

00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:02,420
that some media have have more inherent

00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:05,390
empathy but they certainly make it an

00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:08,110
awful lot easier if email isn't working

00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:10,410
try switching to a more immediate

00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:13,090
communication mechanism like IM or IRC

00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:15,280
be careful with this when you're dealing

00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:17,740
with people from a different language

00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:20,250
background to you because it can make it

00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:23,230
more difficult for them to communicate

00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:25,270
even though it makes the emotional side

00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:27,520
of things easier it can make the

00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:29,170
technical side harder but it can pull

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,320
you back on track to say okay we're all

00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:36,280
on the same team here when you're not

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,080
writing essays to each other also also

00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,790
it varies if you have one person who's

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,700
typing very very fast and just flooding

00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:44,230
and flooding this doesn't always work

00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,540
switching to the phone picking up the

00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:48,520
phone and calling someone it's a really

00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:50,860
good way of increasing the emotional

00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,780
bandwidth and it doesn't need to be a

00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:55,179
big long conversation again these are

00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:57,429
ways of getting back on track so that

00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:58,630
you can have the technical conversations

00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:03,520
that you actually wanted to have in the

00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:05,830
first place video chat video chat

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:09,309
nowadays when I when I started doing

00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:12,520
video chat it was for work and most

00:27:09,309 --> 00:27:14,980
commonly I was the only person in in my

00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:18,490
room and everybody else was in a room

00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:21,490
like a minimum lightspeed 50

00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:23,950
milliseconds away 10 milliseconds is

00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:26,830
typically the threshold at which humans

00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:29,080
can recognize delay so these guys were

00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:31,270
fairly far away even if we had been

00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,130
using absolutely light speed

00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:36,520
communications they were 18 people in a

00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:38,590
room it was bloody awful but nowadays we

00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,910
have technology the technology has

00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:42,400
improved in our internet connections

00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:44,200
have improved the only thing I would say

00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:47,919
is don't put 18 people in one room in

00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:51,419
one person in the other rush but now put

00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,419
everybody on a level playing field

00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:06,680
morels those two people should all be on

00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:09,230
their own phones instead of gather

00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:12,070
around speakerphone so that one guy is

00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:12,070
here you go

00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:17,860
yeah so the it was the nap Friedman you

00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:20,350
said had a had a blog post about this

00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:22,990
when he was working at Novell and their

00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:25,230
policy was that everybody should be

00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:27,850
dialed in individually to the meeting

00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:31,270
you know even if you're ten guys in the

00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:33,429
same space that's okay you all dial in

00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:35,740
on your own phone so that everybody is

00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:40,450
at the same disadvantage or the same

00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:42,520
it's a level playing field he I find you

00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:45,690
don't necessarily have to be that strict

00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:48,400
sometimes you need to enforce that rule

00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:51,130
to get away from the 18 person

00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:54,039
conference room the company i'm working

00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:56,289
at now we're mostly remote and we find

00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:58,570
it works if you have up to sort of two

00:28:56,289 --> 00:29:01,049
or three or four people in one place and

00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:03,850
and then individuals scattered around

00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:07,390
but beyond that it does get quite

00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:09,760
overwhelming also i haven't yet found

00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:12,450
any audio system that's good enough to

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,159
pick up all of those 18 people in a room

00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:16,929
so you're going to have little back

00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:18,429
chatter conversations going on that you

00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:19,809
can kind of hear something's happening

00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:22,059
but you can't tell what they're saying

00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:24,070
and all of that kind of stuff and it so

00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:26,520
it ends up with the people who are not

00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:29,289
in that room feeling left out and again

00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:31,510
perception is reality even if they're

00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:33,490
not being left out even if the back

00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:36,280
channel is can you see the screen I

00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:39,820
can't see the screen they people who are

00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:42,400
on the remote end feel left out and then

00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:47,470
you get these bad feelings and the

00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:49,960
cooperation just plummets yeah voice

00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:52,659
adds inflection video ads facial

00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,789
expressions adds body language is

00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:57,490
somebody you know excited about the idea

00:29:54,789 --> 00:30:01,750
are they really not looking like they

00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:04,559
want to be there at all and finally get

00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:08,700
off your ass and go and talk to people I

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:12,100
real life is absolutely hands-down the

00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:16,299
best way of increasing the emotional

00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:19,390
bandwidth it's hard it's it's expensive

00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:21,429
it takes time how do you get all of

00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:23,720
these people together in a one room at

00:30:21,429 --> 00:30:25,460
one time I'm on

00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:29,299
weiser eboard for a non-profit and there

00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:31,940
are nine advisors and trying to get all

00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:33,530
of us in one space even only trying to

00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:36,710
get the half-dozen who are on the west

00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:40,460
coast of the US in one space it's a

00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:43,130
nightmare but it's well worth it if

00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:46,490
you're in an office be the programmer

00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:48,679
who goes up who stands up walks over to

00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:50,559
the sales guys or the support guys or

00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:54,049
whoever it is that's questioning you and

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:57,530
says hey what's going on how can I help

00:30:54,049 --> 00:31:05,900
you have those conversations you will be

00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:07,940
a miracle worker that is that is what

00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:14,270
Marissa Meyer is trying to do at yahoo

00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:16,190
right now yeah it's it works there are

00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:18,980
other really good reasons that remote

00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:20,570
working works but I I'm a remote worker

00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:24,169
I've been a remote work for a long time

00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:27,200
and honestly if you told me you can have

00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:29,659
you know 10 times your salary but you

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,390
never get to go to the office I wouldn't

00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:34,580
take it I absolutely have to go to the

00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:38,960
office don't have to do it very often

00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:42,169
for me I find every 2-3 months I go down

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,240
for a week and I don't actually get a

00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:46,640
whole lot of productive work done when

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:50,510
I'm down there I really don't I am way

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:53,570
more productive by any measure when I am

00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:55,070
sitting at my own desk at home with

00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:58,100
nobody else around and I haven't seen

00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:59,900
anybody for two weeks but I have to go

00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:04,240
down and make those connections and have

00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:04,240
those human relationships Laura

00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:11,480
when you go to the opposite e-billing is

00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,700
better if anything work-related you can

00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,059
really just gone a few days or playing

00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,009
with

00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:19,049
trust so that when somebody gets the

00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:22,190
email from you that every it is it's

00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:22,190
another from the other

00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:31,000
yeah so Laura's Nora is pointing out

00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,130
that part of that is building those

00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,380
relationships and Trust so that when you

00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:39,970
get those emails it's not simply an

00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:42,160
email from a computer or you know we've

00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:44,410
passed the Turing test we recognize that

00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,660
these are people these are individuals

00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:49,210
they have hobbies they have likes and

00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:50,440
dislikes they have families you know it

00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:52,660
doesn't matter if you go to the office

00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:56,200
and all you talk about is the Super Bowl

00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:59,220
that's fine that's ok just have those

00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,220
human relationships

00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:10,090
that that is something more easily

00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:12,960
communicated that people really care

00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,960
about what you're doing

00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:20,130
yep so the Marvin was making the point

00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:22,440
that people have expectations and I

00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:24,210
think people have expectations when

00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,640
they've never met you what they don't

00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:29,160
have and the second part you pointed out

00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,190
was they have an appreciation and it's

00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:34,560
easier to communicate that appreciation

00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:38,190
that that your work is valued and you as

00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:39,690
a person are valued and it's much easier

00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:41,280
to communicate that when you're sitting

00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:43,590
beside someone you can say oh thanks for

00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,360
that or you know that was great or we

00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:47,010
really appreciated you helping me out

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:51,540
with those release notes or whatever it

00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:53,880
is yeah we're we're human beings and we

00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:56,010
have this need to be loved it's it's

00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:59,760
like it's literally up there with food

00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:02,280
and water and air we need to have these

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:08,700
personal connections or we just can't

00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:10,020
thrive I only have a few minutes left so

00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:13,800
we'll try and get through one or two

00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:16,890
more it's not a competition rate limit

00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:19,680
if you find yourself sending three

00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:21,050
emails to the one person you know even

00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:27,150
over the course of the whole morning

00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:29,610
slow down it's okay the faster you send

00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:31,110
the less you're comprehending right the

00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:33,120
faster you are sending out those emails

00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:36,060
the less attention you're paying to each

00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:39,330
of those emails it's like you you just

00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:41,580
can't compress attention like that but

00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:42,960
also the less the person on the other

00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:47,010
end is paying attention to what they're

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,990
receiving from you right you all know

00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:51,000
you all of you who have your laptop's

00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:53,220
open and have the emails in front of you

00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,510
you know there are people who when you

00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,160
see the email from that person you go I

00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:58,440
don't need to read that now he's always

00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:03,840
sending the email a little way if it'll

00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:05,520
be fine so rate limit your sending again

00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:08,820
on the it's not a competition find

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:11,880
common ground argue interests not

00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:13,530
positions and we might have to skip

00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,600
ahead to get to the to the required

00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:19,080
reading section but these slides will be

00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:22,200
up online later getting to yes is a

00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:26,170
really good book to read for any kind of

00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:27,520
communication it talks about negotiation

00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:32,589
but it turns out that all of our

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:35,079
communication is negotiation quit trying

00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:37,990
to win decide what you need communicate

00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:44,109
communicate as clearly as you can and

00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:46,000
then stop talking if the other person

00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:48,270
isn't giving you what you need he'll

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,680
find it elsewhere yelling at them

00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:53,349
hammering on at them is not going to get

00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,910
it to happen if you need to find another

00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:57,460
route find somebody else who can help

00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:59,680
you to persuade that's fine but banging

00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:02,589
on and banging on if you keep doing what

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,359
you've always done if they're not

00:36:02,589 --> 00:36:05,680
responding they're not going to start

00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:10,869
responding just because you asked them

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:12,849
three more times these are Grice's

00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:15,579
Maxim's again these slides will be

00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:19,000
online later and you can get them I'm

00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:21,640
starting to run out of time use the

00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,799
passive the writers I know are having a

00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:26,710
momentary cringe at this but bear in

00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:30,040
mind that we're not writing we're

00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:31,420
talking with our fingers when you're

00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:34,540
talking with your fingers using the

00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:36,640
passive can be a really good way of just

00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:39,940
lowering the tension and getting away

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,260
from finger pointing and it's this is

00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,930
the difference for those of you who

00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:45,460
don't have a linguistic or grammar

00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:49,000
background it's the difference between

00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:50,589
saying you broke the build so there's

00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,109
this emotional arousal and nobody's

00:36:50,589 --> 00:36:55,750
really listening to what you need next

00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:58,000
they're just well I didn't break the

00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:59,440
build or well I broke the build but

00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,500
there was this thing that needed in it

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,799
and then the other way of saying it is

00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:07,839
someone broke the build which is sort of

00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:11,200
finger point east ill and it's it's I

00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:13,119
didn't do it someone broke the build but

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,940
in English we have this construction

00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,470
that doesn't actually exist in a lot of

00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:24,490
other languages where we can just say

00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:26,500
the build broke the build broke I don't

00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:29,290
know how it happened I don't care how it

00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:32,049
happened the build broke the build broke

00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:33,579
itself essentially who like who broke

00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:35,950
good how it broke when it broke is not

00:37:33,579 --> 00:37:37,869
the point the bill needs to be fixed and

00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:40,170
now we can start working on that

00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:40,170
together

00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:48,080
when you're wrong say so when the other

00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:51,350
person is right say so when you're right

00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:53,330
shut up if you're really right somebody

00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:57,350
else will realize they may or may not

00:37:53,330 --> 00:38:00,470
point it out that's okay when the other

00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:03,400
person is wrong shut up point out the

00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:07,010
brokenness but don't point fingers if

00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:09,170
somebody is persistently wrong and and

00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:11,810
its really hampering your ability to get

00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:13,940
work done take them aside and talk to

00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:17,000
them about it at some point when things

00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:22,400
are not broken when things are broken

00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:25,010
just just get on to fixing them give

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,840
people an out face is something that's

00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:29,450
talked about a lot in Eastern cultures

00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:31,130
less so in our culture it's not

00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:32,800
something that we care about less it's

00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:36,650
just something that we talk about less

00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:39,200
don't corner people let them save face

00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:41,420
give them a way of getting on with

00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:46,070
fixing the problem without having to say

00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:49,310
yeah okay I made a mistake be all of

00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:51,680
this is part of the human be willing to

00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:55,580
admit when you don't know say I'm sorry

00:38:51,680 --> 00:39:01,910
say thank you if you broke the build and

00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:04,190
it paid someone at 3am bring scotch and

00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:06,170
the final one i'll give you because i

00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:10,340
really have run out of time if it

00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:12,260
doesn't matter do it their way if it

00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:16,430
doesn't matter and you still want to do

00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:20,780
it your way you're lying it matters okay

00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:23,050
and if it if you're saying it doesn't

00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:25,790
matter but we still have to do it my way

00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:27,530
think about that and go well why do we

00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:31,730
have to do it my way what is there about

00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:33,920
this that matters and then explain that

00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:35,990
because then we can get somewhere and we

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,140
can move on and we can we can say yes

00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:40,340
okay we'll do it your way or we can say

00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:44,420
no we're not going to do it your way but

00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:46,100
here's the reasons why and if you're

00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:49,760
arguing for the sake of arguing don't do

00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:51,470
that or do it at Toastmasters or some

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,040
you know do it at your local debate club

00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,930
the modeling

00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:57,200

00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,590
