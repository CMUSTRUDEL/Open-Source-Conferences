	Why averages lie and how to truely monitor your systems

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

We spend most of our time looking at the reported averages of our monitoring systems, completely disregarding the painful truth that the numbers that we look at and present to our bosses, to our business and make decisions based upon, do not represent our user experience. This simple fact seems to surprise many people. It feels good looking at steady state monitoring charts. In this session, you will be told why is it important to pay to the "higher end" of the percentile spectrum in most application monitoring, benchmarking, and tuning environments and how you can make better usage of the open-source tooling we have at our disposal ( giving examples on both OSS HDR and T-Digest Histograms ).
