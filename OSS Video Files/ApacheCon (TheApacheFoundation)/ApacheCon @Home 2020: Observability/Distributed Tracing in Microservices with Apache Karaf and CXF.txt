Microservice Architectural Pattern suggests splitting of the business domain to several independent bounded contexts exposed as microservices. It brings a lot of benefits for teams working on microservices independently, but, from other side, complicates the problem analysis and monitoring. Sometimes it is very hard to detect which component causes slowdown and failure, to analyse what happens with request spans multiple services. The solutions for this challenge are distributed tracing and monitoring. Talk will introduce and explain basic tracing terminology: span, trace and context. Presenter will show common approaches to distributed tracing using Apache Karaf, CXF and Zipkin, SpringBoot and Sleuth frameworks. Talk contains some real project examples and demos.

The areas of his interest are REST API design, Microservices, Cloud, resilient distributed systems, security and agile development. Andrei is PMC and committer of Apache CXF and committer of Syncope projects. He is member of OASIS S-RAMP Work Group and speaker at Java and Apache conferences.
