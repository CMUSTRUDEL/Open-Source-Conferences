00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,010
when I step off the stage oh you can see

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:14,219
Nick who is waiving drink tickets in the

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:17,810
air like you just know Nick does not

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:23,670

00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:25,140
well you need the exercise then Jim Jim

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,500
and I are friends right it's okay

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:31,289
yeah I didn't just tackle a random ruler

00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:36,680
oh so we have a few announcements before

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:40,700
we get started so after this everyone

00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:43,440
birds of a feather it's hard to operate

00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,539
birds of a feather will be immediately

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,579
after this at 7 o'clock so be sure you

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,809
check in for that this is the schedule

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,789
you can get it on the apache khan

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:54,899
website you have to mouse over the

00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:57,360
schedule thing in order to get this link

00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:01,140
though so touch devices kind of a pain

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,000
the internet it's really hard yeah

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,580
really weird things happen on the

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,070
internet too second thing is there are

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,020
no keynotes tomorrow morning so keep

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,860
that in mind but we do start at 9:00 so

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,860
you should wake up anyway

00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,759
so we should do our lightning talks we

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,530
should you are late you talk you know I

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,670
actually came to find out they're a

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,100
couple folks that don't know the rules

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,380
of the lightning talks so we should

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,380
cover that so everyone in here came

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,390
prepared to give an hour-long talk right

00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:33,810
yeah and you can't reuse one you've

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:36,119
already done this week that's how it

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,030
works five minutes oh I don't know it's

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:42,270
five hours no no five minutes all right

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:46,110
no slides no slide unless you're rich

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:48,899
Bowen he's not here he's not in this

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:51,119
room all right well no slides unless

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,579
you're rich Bowen and then any topic and

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,040
actually this time we had a lot of

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,740
really great suggestions this is kind of

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,899
like the the lightning talks for the

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,299
incubator basically it is we have we

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,380
have mini incubator theme talks really

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,509
excited about that

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,700
we awesome but first we have not an

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,500
incubator we have Shane who appears to

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,770
be attempting to finish slides against

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,640
the rule

00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:20,120
right this minute oh wait you look a lot

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,070
like Rich Poe and all of a sudden yeah

00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:27,650
that's not Shana Keaney that's rich

00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:30,260
Boeing and let him come up here all

00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,720
right Shane so Shane is our first

00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:38,030
lightening talk things you might not

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:39,830
know about Apache thank you thank you so

00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:44,630
hi my name is Shane Kirk crew and this

00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:46,190
is my 23rd Apache con and I'm the timer

00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:49,340
hey I've got five things I've got five

00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:51,200
minutes I can do this I am NOT by far by

00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,050
far not the most Apache khan's ever rich

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,150
Pro and obviously is that at 28 so we

00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:58,310
can see who's between 23 and 25 but um

00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,709
and my hope is that I will be attending

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:05,270
another 23 Apache cons and seeing many

00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:06,790
of you there so my lightning talk is 5

00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,990
things you might not know about Apache

00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,660
well of course we're geeks we start with

00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:14,240
zero does Apache have a URL shortening

00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,800
service yes we do it's called s dot

00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,420
Apache org hopefully that's easy enough

00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,900
to remember because I have links in my

00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:23,360
slides that's why I have slides we have

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,640
our own URL URL shortener so that when

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,010
we shortened URLs they'll be around as

00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,090
long as our info team is here so if you

00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,010
can think of other things that go away

00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,800
after a while the foundation will

00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:37,280
protect your IP and keep it going as

00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,350
long as we're here so number one common

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,570
question is what is a PMC in fact

00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:43,549
somebody just today said what I still

00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:45,290
don't get the relationship of PMC's to

00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:47,120
the board and the rest of the projects

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:50,750
so a PMC is a project management

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,989
committee and here on the slides s dot

00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:55,850
Apache org slash about - PMC and there

00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:58,400
will be a useful content for you that

00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,750
will answer this question imagine an org

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,180
chart for corporation we've got the

00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:05,150
board of directors and we've got our 200

00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:07,670
or so PMC's top-level projects and each

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:10,880
one dotted line reports to the board

00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:13,430
that's it now the Board expects

00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,620
reporting for community and branding and

00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:18,820
legal issues and we help out but for

00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:21,140
technical direction each PMC is its own

00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,150
organization they do their own thing so

00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,530
they're truly independent in many ways a

00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,580
lot of people have a hard time

00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,069
understanding that it's

00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,720
so lightweight it also means that every

00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:32,080
director has about 20 direct reports

00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,490
which is kind of crazy but we manage

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,229
number two how do I become an apache

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:40,490
member or how do I buy a seat on the

00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:42,319
board you can't so unlike some other

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:45,500
organizations we do not sell seats in

00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:47,120
the board we do not have an application

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,009
process that you where you can come and

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,139
sign a form and maybe pay a fee or

00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:52,819
something and become a member if you're

00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:54,139
asking to become a member that's

00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:57,020
probably not the right way to go around

00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:59,599
go about it what is the right way to go

00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:02,300
about it is use the Apache way to serve

00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:05,389
the public good do work help out the

00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,940
projects be an evangelist for our

00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:10,699
community model of development and the

00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:13,400
existing members of BASF will hopefully

00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:15,080
notice that existing members can

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,120
nominate someone and then we have a

00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,969
private ballot and that is the only way

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,159
to become a member the board is elected

00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:23,389
by the membership so they are fiercely

00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:25,310
independent I mean there's there's no

00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:27,439
way that a corporation could exert

00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,000
control because all the members in here

00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:32,029
are all very independent and we're the

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,759
only way to get to the board estan

00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:38,029
Apache at org about independence also

00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:41,629
useful well what is an apache member in

00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:43,039
this context an apache member it's

00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:45,500
probably what you think it really means

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,509
a shareholder of the corporation of the

00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,810
Apache Software Foundation the nonprofit

00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:53,509
organization which means exciting stuff

00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:55,580
like annual members meetings and proxy

00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:56,750
forms to vote for the board like all

00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,639
those little papers you get from your

00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,919
stock options donor stock investments

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,110
right we usually just toss those out not

00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:04,699
very exciting you do get to vote for the

00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:07,370
board okay

00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:09,440
the value of being an Apache member is

00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:12,259
not that you speak for the foundation or

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,360
not that you're an official it does mean

00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:16,490
you have visibility into all Apache

00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,740
projects the members help provide

00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:21,710
oversight for our independence which

00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,659
means they can help mentor any project

00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,710
they want now they don't have their have

00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:26,150
merit on the project they're not a

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,789
committer on any project unless they

00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,990
earn it but they can show up in help and

00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:31,520
hey say hey you know I'd like to help

00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,529
how could I help you and hopefully

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,940
projects will respond and you know learn

00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:39,500
a few things about good community

00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:41,480
management well how can I be successful

00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,860
so Shane you've just said it's hard to

00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,440
do all these things well we all live in

00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,300
different ways and one under appreciated

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,630
resource that a lot of members have been

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,820
writing are the success at Apache blog

00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:55,610
series which is a series of essays of

00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:58,430
stories so I usually write documentation

00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:00,980
and procedures here a test out Apache at

00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,840
org slash about success there's a whole

00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,840
list of essays and personal stories that

00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,550
explain how to do these things why

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,710
they're important and often that's

00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:11,750
useful for the different people in the

00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,920
community to understand and we don't we

00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,360
don't link to these nearly often enough

00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,850
they go out in the in the press releases

00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,910
but I don't think people really go read

00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:23,300
them so number five how do I get in for

00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:26,090
things for my project you have to ask

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:28,810
for them it's pretty simple you just

00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:32,360
need to ask now approach that be polite

00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:34,900
include ponies they like ponies infra no

00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,700
gnomes cuz gnomes come off the works

00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,140
again about - infra link

00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,880
the key part about asking for something

00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,680
from infra is knowing the right place to

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,960
ask whether it's a JIRA ticket or a

00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,760
self-serve tool and make sure you're

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,590
clear with what you actually need an

00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:52,820
intern will get back to you we have a

00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:54,800
paid crack in fest infra team who it's

00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,169
their job to sell it serve serve

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,720
projects needs as much as the ASF can

00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:02,930
and they do a lot of customer support

00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,790
and it is quite fun to see that and by

00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,040
the way since it's a tradition on stage

00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:09,710
Apache is hiring a new infrastructure

00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:12,979
person so we have a job hosting or an

00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:15,110
infra lead so our info staffer so please

00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:18,590
consider applying and you could get paid

00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:21,380
to work at Apache and number six how do

00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:23,720
I get Shane off the stage well this is

00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,970
tokay the dark one and pálinka there and

00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,169
they are lovely to sit together and snap

00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,439
on the couch and that's what I would

00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:39,829
love to do thank you

00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:41,389
I got a good news for you rich delegated

00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:42,039
this task to you but you're not doing it

00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:43,969
right

00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:47,660
everyone that's been up on stage has

00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:49,790
been wearing Hawaiian clothing so it's

00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,439
important that uh that you also wear a

00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,009
Hawaiian shirt otherwise you're just not

00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:56,389
doing it right

00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:58,939
I better I got good news for you rich

00:08:56,389 --> 00:09:00,500
fire here yeah you weren't here but in

00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:02,329
order to be allowed to use slide Shane

00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,379
had to be rich Bowen so he has to do all

00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:07,279
your work for the next year

00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:10,759
sweet all right I'm gonna go take a

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,259
vacation excuse me all right so while

00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:16,550
Daniel reconsiders all his life fashion

00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:18,350
choices I met up with with no slides and

00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,569
a solid actual five-minute timer that

00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,560
Shane got out of we have that was more

00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:24,050
than five minutes dude

00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,360
Steph and Rochelle telling us about

00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:32,740
Apache MX met our first incubator

00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:32,740
project on the stage welcome

00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:54,199
welcome my name is Stefan Lucia it's my

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:57,790
first Apache con and thank you and I'm a

00:09:54,199 --> 00:10:00,230
contributor at the Apache MX net project

00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:03,649
patchy MX net is a deep learning

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:08,480
framework and incubating since January

00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:12,680
2017 Apache MX net provides interfaces

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:15,620
to architect train and serve neural

00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:18,800
networks with neural networks you can

00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:22,660
either use your own data or pre trained

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:28,519
model models from the MX net model soo

00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:34,810
to do things like face detection image

00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:37,819
classification drive cars autonomously

00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:40,939
process natural language or do machine

00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:43,550
translation the possibilities are

00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:45,889
endless and only limited by your

00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:49,420
imagination to use neural networks to

00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:51,920
bit exciting applications

00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:55,189
the possibilities are vast across

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,600
industries allocation domains used in

00:10:55,189 --> 00:11:03,139
autumn a autonomous vehicles healthcare

00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:07,939
finance but also to secure computer

00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:10,730
networks at the core MX net has a highly

00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:14,180
scalable distributed processing engine

00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:17,180
which allows you to process vast amount

00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:19,970
of data on clusters of GPUs to train

00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:22,660
your models for the applications you

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:25,040
want to use to make predictions or

00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:29,930
impact the way your application is

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:32,360
reacting to its users MX net not only

00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:34,850
provides a faster back-end to Kharis

00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,339
which is a popular neural network

00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:40,519
description language it also provides

00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:43,610
its own high level API to describe

00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:45,980
neural networks training procedures or

00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:49,370
the way you want to serve your models

00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:52,480
for the specific applications on top of

00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:57,140
MX net we have packages like Sakai

00:11:52,480 --> 00:12:01,940
fluency via Luna and LP which allow for

00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:04,350
first development and deployment of

00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:08,940
applications in the deep learning space

00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:12,810
in the AI space tomorrow you have the

00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:15,900
opportunity at 9:00 a.m. or 10 a.m. or 3

00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:18,330
D 3:40 p.m. to learn more about MX net

00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:21,930
right we will have talks about deep

00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:24,060
learning the MX net ecosystem as well as

00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:28,080
also the integration of MX net with

00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:31,740
spark to serve models for influencing MX

00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:35,220
net also provides a number of api's in

00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:39,270
various languages like seeing our

00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:41,820
scholar closer Junior and soon also in

00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:46,080
Java so that you can easily integrate a

00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:49,110
mix net into your own applications the

00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:52,830
project is looking for contributors to

00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:54,900
grow and diversify the community by

00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,450
science the usual opportunities to have

00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:59,880
with bug fixes documentation improvement

00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:01,440
and feature enhancements you also have

00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,220
the opportunity to learn

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,830
state-of-the-art technology in AI and

00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:11,370
you have the opportunity to influence a

00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:16,700
pretty amazing technology we can barely

00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:16,700
imagine how society will be influenced

00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:24,660
please visit our website at MX net dot

00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,760
IO there you can find references of

00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:29,120
course to the github repo but also

00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:33,090
tutorials blog post and additional

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,950
education and material and if you hear

00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:38,790
anybody talking about a thing like

00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:41,730
tensor flow or Python make sure you come

00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:43,770
across us really educated and ask them

00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:47,790
if they already looked at Apache IMAX

00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:50,580
net thank you very much and the one

00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:52,350
thing you need to learn and I couldn't

00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,100
use slides so I had to go back to old

00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,100
fashioned technology

00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:13,709
thirty seconds

00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:16,759
cool you have to talk about MX not for

00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:16,759
the next 25 seconds go

00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:26,189
I learned it to MX net and not mixing it

00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:29,059
I've heard people saying in both ways so

00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:32,639
who's our second third talk math is hard

00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:37,589
counting that's one time it didn't end

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:46,290
well fair totally fair

00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:50,059
wait I want you a picture again what is

00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:50,059
that II want to tell them what that is

00:14:53,029 --> 00:15:02,309
it's Doctor Who know what I think that's

00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:04,439
a wrinkle in time so next we're gonna

00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:06,569
have mark Thomas telling us how to sell

00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:13,169
our swag or sell your swag it sounds

00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:14,639
yours are you here mark stand up where

00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:20,279
are you just gazing a doctor who know

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:23,249
what's happening okay

00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:26,040
the community development project has

00:15:23,249 --> 00:15:29,040
been doing some work to set up a swag

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:31,230
store on RedBubble so we now have the

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,809
ability for any Apache project to come

00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:36,629
along to us point us at the logo they

00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:39,449
want to use help us set that logo up on

00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:42,540
the products so the t-shirts clocks

00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:44,699
bedspread scarves you name it you can

00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,169
sell it it's got the load your logo the

00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:49,709
way you want it on RedBubble

00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:52,470
and then you can sell it and if the ASF

00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:55,559
gets I think it's about 20% of the sales

00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:57,119
as well as an example this is when we

00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:58,769
set up for Tomcat so we've got the

00:15:57,119 --> 00:16:00,869
Tomcat logo on the front and back of the

00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:03,179
book if you'd like to set your project

00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:05,129
up that way then I will be around

00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:07,230
tomorrow somewhere in the seats behind

00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:09,569
the registration desk come and find me

00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:11,519
it'll take about 15 minutes all you need

00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:13,709
to do is say yet logo left a bit right a

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,770
bit up a bit in a bit out of it yep fine

00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:19,230
great do that about 40 times and

00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:20,370
we'll all will all be set up hopefully

00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:24,540
see some of you smart thank you very

00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:29,130
much and now Daniel can talk about swag

00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:31,610
for three minutes 50 seconds well done

00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,610
well done

00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:41,490
Ruth I love beer do you like beer hey do

00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:44,370
y'all like beer I would like to say

00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:46,800
thank you to Google cloud for the beer

00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:53,550
so let's go ahead and give our sponsor

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:54,720
of the lightning talk a big man I just

00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,540
walked down the Long Island address I

00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:01,170
feel like after Mary does a beer now

00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:02,730
you're a champion thank you oh thank ya

00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:04,170
can you restart this thing or do we have

00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,189
to talk about the clock for three

00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:09,329
minutes no it's cool

00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:11,939
okay it has a button yes okay then I

00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:13,290
would like to hear about is there's

00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:19,170
another incubator project so that way we

00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:21,360
have next no no no so Geoffrey Geoffrey

00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:24,750
painter painter is actually gonna tell

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:29,400
us about how a patchy turbine folks it

00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:29,950
isn't dead so let's welcome Jeffrey to

00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:37,509
the stage

00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:40,309
[Applause]

00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:43,909
hi everyone my name's Jeffrey painter

00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:47,029
from Raleigh North Carolina this is my

00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:49,549
third Apache con I was in Miami last

00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:53,659
year that was my second my first was

00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:56,299
2003 in Las Vegas I had a long extended

00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:58,789
break because I went back to school I

00:17:56,299 --> 00:18:03,169
got a degree and then I ended up working

00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:04,490
in big pharma for 11 years where I sort

00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:07,159
of became the domain expert on

00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:10,340
biomedical ontologies in knowledge

00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:13,940
representation so I worked primarily

00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:16,269
with geneticists statisticians and do a

00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:20,539
lot of data mining support kind of role

00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:24,070
but two years ago I left my job and

00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:27,799
started I've cast my consulting company

00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:31,580
but throughout this whole time I've been

00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:34,940
a big fan of Apache back in 2003 I had

00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:38,179
started my first company and I was

00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:41,000
feeling like an imposter I was a Perl

00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:43,700
guy and I learned about this thing from

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,889
Jakarta called Apache turbine and it

00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:49,429
looked like it was the tool to solve all

00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:51,980
the problems I was facing so I built an

00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:55,519
application for small company in North

00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:57,919
Carolina to do order management

00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:01,100
inventory you know that boring business

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,320
kind of stuff but Apache turbine solved

00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,509
all the problems I needed I spent six

00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,480
months deep diving and learning about

00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:11,000
the framework and what it offers if you

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,370
don't know it is one of the early MVC

00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,629
frameworks it provides everything from

00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:17,600
the database layer up to the

00:19:14,629 --> 00:19:19,370
presentation layer and it spun off a lot

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,039
of other sub projects over the years

00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:24,980
including one that probably most

00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:26,899
everyone here knows was maven Apache

00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:29,960
turbine was so complicated to build that

00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:34,190
we had to invent to to manage the build

00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:36,500
process but most my early experience

00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:38,570
back in those days was offering support

00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,809
on the mailing lists helping with

00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:45,019
documentation those kinds of things and

00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:46,130
to Burt Ron's remark about things in the

00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:49,070
Attic

00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:51,410
I really want to echo that community is

00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:54,920
what has kept this code alive over all

00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:57,760
these years and even though I was gone

00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:01,310
for such a long period of time we had to

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,910
still active developers there both in

00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:05,720
Germany

00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:07,810
Thomas bundle and Georg colitas I think

00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,670
that's how you pronounce it who have

00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:15,170
continued and progressed the system over

00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:19,190
the years turbine 4.0 milestone 2 was

00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:21,290
released in 2008 I came back about two

00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:24,430
years ago and in six months we got to

00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:27,350
the 4.0 final released ten years later

00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:29,600
and then shortly thereafter I found a

00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:32,420
bunch of bugs and so we're at 4.0 point

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,540
one but just wanted to let people know

00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:38,900
that you know we're not all facebook or

00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,580
twitter x' it's a platform that's

00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:45,980
allowed me to solve a lot of small

00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:47,390
problems for very targeted domain

00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,850
specific things

00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:52,370
some examples are I built a system for

00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:54,470
the European medical agency they're

00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:57,080
looking at detecting adverse events in

00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:58,730
social media data and so I built a set

00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,910
of collaboration tools on the turbine

00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:05,030
platform which we donated to the World

00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:06,980
Health Organization I've done things

00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:10,370
such as I built a text analytics

00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:14,200
platform using some other great Apache

00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:18,020
projects open NLP the Commons math stats

00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:20,510
library is one of my dear friends as

00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:25,040
well as Apache poi for doing report

00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:27,680
generation and all the great stuff but

00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:31,970
we're moving turbine ford it's it's

00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:34,310
there to help give you all the

00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:37,130
foundations to build a secure web

00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:39,560
application quickly it's really helped

00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:42,920
me and being able to focus on my

00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:46,420
customers problems and any way I can

00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:51,050
give back to Apache has it's just been a

00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:53,000
blessing so thank you if you want to

00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:54,590
learn more about Apache turbine I I had

00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,480
submitted a talk hopefully this will get

00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:58,190
people interested that if I submit a

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,280
talk again next year it might get

00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:04,070
approved

00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:07,880
yeah so I'm I'm the data mining and LP

00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:09,080
guy but I also help out a lot with the

00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:22,300
the turbine project

00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:25,340
thank you complain about these talks I

00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:27,170
spent at least 10 minutes today looking

00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,670
for pictures of people going Shh to put

00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:37,940
at the end of the timer and it doesn't

00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:40,450
run out we'll give it a second not the

00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:45,050
best friend I'll take it alright oh oh

00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:49,160
yay you get the see of all good code man

00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:51,200
good code anyone no developer Daniel

00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,890
would like a tutor and JavaScript if

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,980
anyone's available later he pays in beer

00:22:53,890 --> 00:23:00,460
or whiskey or whiskey Freight who's next

00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:08,020
what do we have we have a whole list Oh

00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:08,020
next what so just thinking no okay

00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:15,800
yeah next we have George Percival who is

00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:18,920
going to tell us about his entire top

00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:20,480
title is geospatial which might last

00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,070
more than five minutes but that's why we

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,870
had timer we do have a timer

00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:26,770
it's all yours shorter I don't see those

00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:29,810
images at the end too so in full motion

00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:33,100
I can't no problems about Daniel's code

00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:35,320
yeah so geospatial is my name but I

00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:40,070
misspelled it you didn't make fun of me

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:43,160
oh okay it's cuz I'm a newbie you don't

00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:45,920
know me enough to call me out yet do ya

00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:48,890
so I'm gonna talk about geospatial as

00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:51,530
essentially an Apache cross-cutting

00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:54,890
category idea so everybody got a t-shirt

00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:58,580
right and has essentially what looks

00:23:54,890 --> 00:24:01,160
like a subway line dropping topological

00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:03,020
subway line we had a good joke about

00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,760
that in the geospatial track as to

00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:07,129
whether anybody else would recognize it

00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:10,129
as a topological map or not

00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:12,679
yeah okay so there are more geospatial

00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:15,289
people out there so the thought is that

00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:18,590
those are categories in your dope file

00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:23,210
and so adding Jews spatial will create a

00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:26,419
new subway line on the Apache subway map

00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:30,519
so so we've done a few geospatial tracks

00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:34,249
at Apache conferences going back 2016 in

00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:36,499
Vancouver in a big data and Apache kana

00:24:34,249 --> 00:24:39,980
Vancouver we did an all-day geospatial

00:24:36,499 --> 00:24:44,149
track there the geospatial excuse me

00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:45,860
apache khan in europe in seville in 2016

00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:49,369
included a geospatial track and then

00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:51,110
today we had a geospatial track that was

00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:53,299
overflowing out the door kind of thing

00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:57,830
with people so a lot of good interests

00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:59,480
there so why why is there interest you

00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:03,289
know first off the Apache projects are

00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:05,360
implementing geospatial my day job is

00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:07,850
I'm with an organization called the open

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,289
geospatial consortium which looks at

00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:12,879
innovation and standards around

00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:15,769
geospatial and so I have an interest in

00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:17,149
where geospatial innovation happens I

00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:19,700
want to be there I also want to make

00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:22,299
sure it doesn't go off the rails we have

00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:25,700
been fighting for 20 years for the

00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:29,090
well-recognized lat long versus long lat

00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:31,009
order problem to go away I don't want to

00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:33,049
see that reinvent it again and again and

00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:34,970
again so I really have kind of a

00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:38,990
personal interest in that but there are

00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:41,720
you know a lot of projects that are in

00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:45,409
Apache that are doing geospatial so I

00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:48,409
bring to the conversation an interest

00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:51,769
from an open standards perspective which

00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:54,619
i think is the benefit to open source in

00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:57,110
terms of the ability to build your code

00:25:54,619 --> 00:26:00,970
based upon you know the history of what

00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:03,830
geospatial is about we saw a great talk

00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:06,379
about query languages and the like from

00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:08,090
Julian Hyde and you know builds off with

00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:10,789
some really good work that's been around

00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:12,919
for years on how did you query languages

00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:15,320
he has extended that to a level of

00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:18,529
abstraction in calcite that I think is

00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,160
going to be very valuable we saw a good

00:26:18,529 --> 00:26:24,420
presentation from sis

00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:27,210
from Martin and its value across the

00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:29,190
organization's about geo spatial

00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:31,970
coordinates we saw multiple application

00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,720
presentations better code

00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:36,720
interoperability and code reuse

00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:39,540
plug-and-play so the ability to

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,820
essentially have multiple projects that

00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:45,210
kind of do something similar but allow

00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:47,490
you know integrators to to choose based

00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:49,530
upon what the code does as opposed to

00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:52,890
how much they have to spend in terms of

00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:56,400
glue code so a lot of people in the

00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:57,840
track today a lot of interest so I think

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,800
you know there's something there that

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:04,170
Apache can do what can you do first off

00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,510
there is a geospatial at Apache org

00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:07,890
mailing list so if you're interested in

00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:10,370
the topic join the mailing list

00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:13,440
stablished a couple of years ago add

00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:16,710
geospatial as a category in your dope

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,960
file for your project if your project

00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:21,120
implements OGC standards of which we

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,370
heard of several today i will help you

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,980
promote your project in that world of

00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:28,860
OGC standards so free promotion if

00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:30,480
that's of interest and you know the

00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,830
question it is that's on the table

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,600
really is is there interest in the

00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:36,840
project's sufficient to establish

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,790
additional infrastructure structure

00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,310
coordination and the like if there is

00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:43,340
your projects interested put that in

00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:46,740
your project reports let the board know

00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:49,050
we'll see where we go you know I have a

00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,640
personal interest if you guys have an

00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:52,860
interest in the patchy community our

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,100
geospatial I'm interested to work with

00:27:52,860 --> 00:28:01,400
you and you know go category team

00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:01,400
geospatial yay there you go

00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,380
so I want to go ahead and say if you

00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:09,180
have drink tickets left the bars gonna

00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:11,040
be closing about like now so now's a

00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:17,160
good time to go use them and bring me a

00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:17,730
glass of white wine Joey really did

00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,950
George

00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:21,930
okay so first since you're disappointed

00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:24,180
that I didn't publicly mock you George

00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:26,490
could not spell geospatial on the signup

00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:29,660
sheet so did any of your geospatial

00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:35,640
friends recognize the map on the shirt

00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:37,890
yeah it's Montreal so but it's actually

00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,660
it is the future planning of Montreal

00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:41,400
it's so they have a map where they

00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,770
intend for future lines to go because we

00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,540
had more projects than Montreal had room

00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:51,780
for but it is actually the Montreal

00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:53,550
subway map absolutely yeah that's

00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:56,070
Hopkins we can totally make that happen

00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:58,350
look my new best friend just arrived now

00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,700
you have to marry this glass of wine I

00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,090
think we established that's how this

00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,240
works

00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:11,390
yeah it's a long aisle isn't it cool

00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:11,390
well thanks to you and you hey RIS hey

00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:16,470
you want to see my best impression of a

00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:22,620
shoe I want to see your best impression

00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:27,150
of a shoe I think we need another Hawk

00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:29,460
like really fast like right now you're

00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:30,630
out you're done oh also if you haven't

00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,520
gotten a bag while you're getting your

00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:33,930
last drink grab an Apache con bag they

00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,220
got a little bit stuck in customs and

00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:37,950
now they're here and you should take one

00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,420
from Driss are fantastic Google sponsor

00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,340
you would also like to give you a google

00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:43,530
hat and a puffy sticker cuz it's like

00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:47,220
1985 in there save me one of those

00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:49,170
stickers cuz they're awesome that was a

00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:53,070

00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:30,990
fascinated by the richness of our

00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:34,710
communities and I'm I'm suspecting that

00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:37,380
some of us have unusual skills or things

00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:39,510
that they can they could teach others so

00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:42,600
I thought about it and we're going to

00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:45,270
play a little role community

00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,580
role-playing game based on a little

00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:50,940
story you might know that there is a

00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:53,880

so hello my name is Martin Alec I'm a

00:39:54,329 --> 00:40:00,599
Hadoop developer and I have unlimited

00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:03,180
storage just for you so most probably

00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:06,269
you know that the Hadoop has some very

00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:09,269
famous sub-project like your MapReduce

00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:11,789
and HDFS for the storage but I think you

00:40:09,269 --> 00:40:15,809
don't know that we have a very new sub

00:40:11,789 --> 00:40:18,569
project Apache Hadoop ozone and I would

00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:20,369
have to talk talk about this sub-project

00:40:18,569 --> 00:40:23,309
and explain why I think that this is the

00:40:20,369 --> 00:40:26,700
most shiny new project in the head

00:40:23,309 --> 00:40:29,970
offered at least for me so I have

00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:32,460
unlimited storage so it's it's a good be

00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:35,190
right you can use it you may ask that

00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:38,010
how can you use it yeah obviously I have

00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:41,940
a very easy API this is some kind of

00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:44,069
custom RPC you need to adjust the fields

00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,529
it had to PowerPC and most probably you

00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:48,650
can also you can just use it from Java

00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:50,940
and can use it from any other language I

00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:51,569
think you are not interested anymore

00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:55,079
right

00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:55,980
maybe the hive and HBase guys but yeah

00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:58,470
that's not

00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:04,890
I understand it's it's not a very good

00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:08,220
deal from now but into HDFS Hadoop HDFS

00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:10,079
the current storage we have the master

00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:13,640
component name node and the name node

00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:16,200
just manages all of the huge binary both

00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:18,869
blocks between the data nodes and it

00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:24,150
replicate replicates all of the data and

00:41:18,869 --> 00:41:28,259
it also expose the data over Hadoop RPC

00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:30,809
in hydro posin we just separated these

00:41:28,259 --> 00:41:32,789
two responsibilities so we have a more

00:41:30,809 --> 00:41:34,680
simple master component which just

00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:36,720
replicates the binary data without

00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:39,599
exposing it just replicates the data

00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:42,569
nothing gasps and Hadoop ozone is an

00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,930
object store or top of it because it's

00:41:42,569 --> 00:41:48,900
so simple component that we can provide

00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:51,000
additional services on top of it and we

00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:53,039
started with an object store which is

00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,289
almost as three compatible it will be an

00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:58,650
s3 comfortable object store because it

00:41:55,289 --> 00:42:01,319
was the most easiest one but we also

00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:01,840
store T we also created an other server

00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:04,450
which

00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:07,300
and expose the data as a POSIX file

00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:09,190
system so you can mount it so you don't

00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,720
need to mount it because it's enough to

00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:12,670
write down your dreams

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:16,960
obviously in kubernetes resource files

00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:21,060
and after that it will be just created

00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:24,010
and mounted by the kubernetes itself and

00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:26,680
everything everything is on top of the

00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:30,160
same storage system so I can just manage

00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:32,760
all of the storage with ozone so ozone

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:35,650
is not just the object store but it's

00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:38,650
generic layer and with the help of ozone

00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:41,560
ayah we can provide multiple type of

00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:43,720
interface and you can use it with s3 API

00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:46,930
you can use it with REST API you can use

00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:49,360
it with Hadoop file system you can use

00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:52,080
it as a POSIX file system you can mount

00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:57,250
it and this is all of the same storage

00:42:52,080 --> 00:43:00,010
so i strictly believe that the storage

00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:03,160
is still an open question in the cloud

00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:06,970
native environments and I also believe

00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:10,160
that Hadoop ozone is let's say one of

00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:16,790
the answers thank you very much

00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:19,260
[Applause]

00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:20,370
I'm pretty disappointed again I thought

00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:25,020
he was gonna tell us how to submit

00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:31,220
patches for the holes in ozone might get

00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:34,500
better I gave you drink tickets be nice

00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:38,580
actually Nick gave most of them out so

00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:41,040
um speaking of which Apache con this is

00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:43,950
a moment of pride congratulations now

00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:51,810
very happy with yourselves we drank all

00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:53,850
of the beer hey puck good right I never

00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:55,860
had a doubt but we actually did it they

00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:58,320
ran out of beer before the bar actually

00:43:55,860 --> 00:44:02,030
closed so I always believed in our

00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:04,950
ability to drink I am proud of you

00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:08,130
awesome so we up next Daniel our next

00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:10,380
speaker is a man that needs very little

00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:11,310
introduction he's been around foundation

00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:13,220
for quite some time

00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:15,930
hen is gonna come and talk about

00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:17,850
enterprise functions which I'm actually

00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:19,590
kind of geeked out about because server

00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:22,490
list is really interesting right now so

00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:26,420
I greatly look forward to this topic so

00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:32,010
that's all you're saying thank you

00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:35,430
thanks so back in Miami I stood here and

00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:38,280
said oh stood there in front of you and

00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:40,590
said I look around and I see recruiters

00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,440
and of course that was wrong I look

00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:45,330
around and I don't see what Curtis I

00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,680
don't see documentation writers I don't

00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:50,310
see market ears

00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:58,410
I don't see security engineers because

00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:59,730
Marc's gone and that's a problem and I'm

00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:01,020
gonna say excited ways for a second time

00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:03,870
do a bunch of thoughts and try and Bing

00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:08,190
him together when I first joined Apache

00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:10,890
was 2001 and IV myself was one of the

00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:12,540
younger people at Apache because when I

00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:14,370
joined Apache I was one of the last

00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:17,400
people I think who got an account from

00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:19,470
brian behlendorf and got a little email

00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:23,700
from Ryan that said I is your account

00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:25,500
and discovered the Brian used to leave

00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:28,290
his office run down the road and

00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,670
we start the server or the crime would

00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:31,110
get out of his office and run down the

00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:34,760
road and install a patch

00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:36,540
Brian was infrastructure and then

00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,790
infrastructure got some volunteers

00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:40,830
because you can't build a small tiny

00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:48,600
open-source foundation on Brian alone

00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:50,190
and then no no no then after some

00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,320
volunteers we discovered that you can't

00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:56,250
build a slightly bigger open-source

00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:59,010
foundation on volunteers and we got a

00:45:56,250 --> 00:46:01,350
contractor and in a few contractors and

00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:04,110
then some employees by a virtual and any

00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:06,660
manager so our info history was this

00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:08,490
slow growth from a little bit of support

00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:11,280
for the fan from the foundation to the

00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:13,830
projects and then rising and getting

00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:20,010
better and being the awesomeness that we

00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:21,570
have noticed info are at the moment and

00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:25,140
we're on a similar path with the legal

00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:26,820
disgust area with trademarks with the PR

00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:31,500
side of things where Sally helps out

00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:35,850
enormous Lea and with security where we

00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:42,450
have the marks and the Attic is another

00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:45,930
service as such the story on that site

00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:48,690
seg ends there so two SEC's so far third

00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:50,730
SEC I've been working at a large

00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:53,310
enterprise company recently for the last

00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:54,780
11 years or so and one of the things

00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:58,560
that intrigued me and going to set

00:46:54,780 --> 00:47:01,650
company was what's the difference

00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:03,750
between a little company and a big

00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:05,430
company and my theory is there's

00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:08,370
mathematical function called enterprise

00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:09,930
and you apply enterprise function to

00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:11,940
little company to get big company so

00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:14,190
what is the difference between an

00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:16,320
open-source foundation that is huge that

00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:18,210
I work on an enterprise foundation and a

00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:20,130
little open-source project but it's

00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:24,030
again another function called Enterprise

00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:26,730
Prime or maybe even that as a thesis the

00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:28,560
same Enterprise function I believe that

00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:30,150
we can learn lots from what enterprise

00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,950
companies do to a little corporate to

00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:33,450
make it a big corporate to do a little

00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:35,700
open-source to make it a big open source

00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:38,820
they have infrastructure administration

00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:41,070
teams they also have we

00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:42,720
kut'rs why don't we have recruiters as

00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:45,150
committers they have graphic design

00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,400
artists why don't we have a group of

00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:49,650
graphic design artists who our patchy

00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:53,340
committers that one of our projects goes

00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:55,680
to and says hey I like some help what we

00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:58,800
do is we tell all our projects go find a

00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,660
graphic design artist how is our project

00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,190
gonna turn that graphic design artist

00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:04,920
into a committer when all they need is a

00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:06,570
single picture out of them we say make

00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:09,690
your documentation better documentation

00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:11,220
is crucial for open source projects but

00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:14,570
how is a project in Iraq and a project

00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:18,150
of coders of y'all going to notice that

00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:19,500
so time in Kentucky how is it how is it

00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:22,410
bunch of code is gonna notice that a

00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:24,060
tech writer is a committee level tech

00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:27,000
writer how they gonna judge the quality

00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:29,190
of the writing being done for them when

00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,800
they're a bunch of coders so my theory

00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:34,470
is we need other sensual committees who

00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:36,210
offer services to the project's not

00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:37,620
Authority not telling them we're in

00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:37,950
charge of all the docs and you can't do

00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:41,430
this

00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:44,790
but services where you go to the tech

00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:46,110
writer committee and say which could you

00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:47,760
help us with our documentation which

00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:49,530
says I have a whole ton of tech writer

00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,430
committees here who are which is always

00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:55,440
my example VP of documentation and so

00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:57,210
lots of tech writers who as a group can

00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,940
build their own community and we as the

00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:01,530
codis I can go to and say help and they

00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:04,110
show up and they help out a little bit

00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:05,610
and I know and I look used tech writer

00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:08,340
as an example because looking in my day

00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:11,760
job I've seen the day job go from having

00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:13,200
tech writers as a central group and a

00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,640
little team wasn't working then having

00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,080
them join the particular business teams

00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,850
didn't work they couldn't grow as a

00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,380
community then putting them back in a

00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:21,110
central group who sort of dotted line

00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:24,450
out two particular businesses and helped

00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:27,720
so my pair to effectively is we need to

00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:29,670
do the infra thing a lot more info as a

00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:33,050
huge success but we need to have 10 more

00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:33,050
infos 11 more emphasis

00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:45,260
so an Daniels code is broken again I

00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:47,660
don't know why it does this so I have to

00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:49,550
be honest I I was I was expecting a talk

00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:50,510
about serverless computing Enterprise

00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:57,440
functions

00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:59,900
oh it's miles away man so fun further

00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,190
review of this list hey I would like

00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:04,099
George to know that he's not the only

00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:05,359
one who can't spell and B for truant

00:50:04,099 --> 00:50:08,150
I've figured out what I'm gonna teach

00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:15,130
when the volcano blows penmanship in

00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:19,280
mention cuz yeah yeah global need here

00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:21,920
but next I'm pretty sure that we have

00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:25,070
Anatoly trash is that how to say your

00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,780
name I hope maybe I understand the

00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:28,359
problem my name is weird to you and he

00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:32,030
is going to tell us about Apache tamiya

00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:35,810
probably yeah I bet

00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:37,970
okay very good all yours AB it means you

00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:41,359
only get two minutes oh yeah okay

00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:44,300
Lissie so Swee get move let's move first

00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:47,630
Santa everybody stand up how are you

00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:55,520
only have five minutes stand up make you

00:50:47,630 --> 00:51:00,020
tall go down enjoy then it hurts in the

00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:05,000
back stand up again and now in the other

00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:11,119
direction go back again enjoy when it

00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:14,330
hurts the back go to the middle now you

00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:17,270
are in the middle Indian name for in the

00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:19,070
middle is tamiya so at least there's a

00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:24,260
chance that you can remember we what

00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:26,900
support is this project's name if you

00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:30,980
have other health issues yeah talk to me

00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:32,750
for us tomorrow so but what what you are

00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:34,790
doing actually actually it's like when

00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:37,280
you have software and you have software

00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:38,599
your input output something is happening

00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:42,589
in between that's okay

00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:45,020
now in between there is something more

00:51:42,589 --> 00:51:47,000
because there's something that controls

00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:49,400
what yourself software actually does

00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,200
okay it's your code that also controls a

00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:54,680
bit what you're not but you also have

00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:57,740
another thing that is configuration so

00:51:54,680 --> 00:52:02,150
everybody here the room which uses

00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:04,220
configuration other way around who does

00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:07,940
not have any configuration inter systems

00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:11,300
one ok hard-coded everything or

00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:13,310
something like that that sounds good so

00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:16,369
reading XML files

00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:19,940
Chason whatever but now you have done

00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:22,609
that for years who whose project now

00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:26,690
also run somehow in some containers

00:52:22,609 --> 00:52:28,849
cloud magic something like that ok and

00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:31,190
then you have kubernetes support you

00:52:28,849 --> 00:52:33,980
write additional code just to have

00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:35,420
support for computers conversation you

00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:38,420
can use copper neatest features like

00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:40,250
science and some balloon but normally

00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:42,380
you have when you won't use your

00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:45,050
kubernetes REST API for example you have

00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:47,990
to write additional code but basically

00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:51,170
that's not necessary if you just put use

00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:53,510
tamiya in the middle of the project

00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:55,310
which is then an abstraction layer that

00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:57,170
basically reads configuration from

00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:59,810
wherever it comes it can come from the

00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:01,970
moon it's ok just have to write a

00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:05,390
property source that basically does that

00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:08,780
you can use that abstraction and instead

00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:11,450
of adding a more code and hard-coded

00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:13,190
into a project just write the module as

00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:14,960
a separate chart that you load on the

00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:17,830
closed path which does the work for you

00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:21,260
and your you have about much better

00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:23,990
separation of concern additionally in

00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:27,650
the Java space well you know time plenty

00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:29,589
time there's also a standard upcoming

00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:32,480
which Kamiya definitely will implement

00:53:29,589 --> 00:53:34,670
if the guys that currently are working

00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,650
on the standards and I'm not a spec

00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:39,490
natira just to in the expert group

00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:42,230
get to make it finish in reasonable time

00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:45,710
nevertheless at least Amalia is already

00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:49,310
there and can be used it's stable and it

00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:55,100
makes basically quite fun

00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:58,490
so last things to test you to tell so go

00:53:55,100 --> 00:54:00,830
to Tom Mariota patches or check out

00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:03,350
approach it out look at it we will have

00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:05,270
near happy to help you in your project

00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:07,250
to get that abstraction layer working

00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:10,910
and so we can learn all San our project

00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:14,000
what we should do better on the other

00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:14,690
way around if somebody finds house so

00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,300
cool

00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:26,270
that he wants to contribute he's

00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:27,740
definitely welcome thanks no it's time

00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:29,660
no time for painting we have to word

00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:31,640
talks in only five minutes so we have to

00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:34,150
have Takashi can I talk about cloud sack

00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,150
right now go

00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:45,560
hi I'm Turkish can i from DC frontier in

00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:49,550
Japan and this is the first time to

00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:53,660
committed but much calm first time to

00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:56,570
come to the Montreal but I don't know

00:54:53,660 --> 00:55:00,380
about the lighting Ito's so I prepared

00:54:56,570 --> 00:55:07,850
20 pages for the strap but I can't use

00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:09,600
it so I look it to speak sorry I speak

00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:12,540
up I am

00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:16,860
the engineer Sabana student interests

00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:22,050
engineers not writing code but and I'm

00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:25,680
also work at weekend for the Microsoft

00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:29,070
so that so I honored to the Microsoft

00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:31,470
MVP for continent working but if you

00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:34,410
want to know about the content talking

00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:44,390
you should go to the all-round this week

00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:50,180
to max at ignite and so I I write

00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:55,280
company profile but skip skip skip sorry

00:55:50,180 --> 00:56:01,320
skip skip yeah I want to speak about

00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:06,450
crosstalk and in frustrated software and

00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:10,290
I our company is a cross stock for the

00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:16,620
Japan regional public cloud and it's

00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:22,650
just scared of very big for me but after

00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:26,960
I talk about some tuning about the

00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:33,420
crosstalk but I can't use a strike so I

00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:41,360
cannot speak explain about performance

00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:49,980
graph so so I decided to use the cheat

00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:55,740
so just a moment I use the cheat to

00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:59,820
tweet my stride to the stress share so

00:56:55,740 --> 00:57:04,790
if you want to know about what I want to

00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:07,310
speak just check the Twitter to the for

00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:11,870
speaking about called Craster

00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:16,260
configuration tuning and performance

00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:20,880
about it but is there anyone to take the

00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:22,900
photo for from me to explain our boss to

00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:28,170
speak about any

00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:29,589
seeing average thank you thank you

00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:33,059
that's all

00:57:29,589 --> 00:57:33,059
please check Vita

00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:45,119
thank you rich can you take a picture so

00:57:42,099 --> 00:57:45,119
that I can tell you I was here

00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:52,960
okay bored now so our time together has

00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:54,849
almost come to an end I'm so sad yeah we

00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,559
do have one more talk and I don't know

00:57:54,849 --> 00:57:59,440
what we're gonna do because I don't I

00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:02,049
mean I want to tell some more puns okay

00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:05,890
our time together has come to an end our

00:58:02,049 --> 00:58:07,780
last talk though pretty jazzed about the

00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:12,240
title we have Narine who's going to tell

00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:12,240
us how this isn't your dad's Microsoft

00:58:13,049 --> 00:58:25,930
awesome welcome thank you hi guys it's

00:58:23,829 --> 00:58:29,020
also my first Apache con so thank you

00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:32,020
for having me um I

00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:34,780
as hand I think referenced earlier I'm

00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:36,520
not actually a a coder my background I

00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:38,890
graduate from the year C of Waterloo as

00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:40,839
a computer engineer and I tried coding

00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,250
for a while I enjoyed it but I didn't

00:58:40,839 --> 00:58:43,809
enjoy staying behind the screens and I

00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:47,170
love talking to people so I wanted to

00:58:43,809 --> 00:58:49,029
get more out and so for the last 10

00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:50,890
years I've been working with within the

00:58:49,029 --> 00:58:53,380
Microsoft services side of the house

00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:55,720
doing consulting support working with

00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:57,940
our customers hands down and I used to

00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:59,710
kind of think it's really you know I was

00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:01,240
their employee rather than Microsoft's

00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:03,700
employee because my job was to take

00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:05,559
their pain and fight their battles and

00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,700
bring them out and then last year for

00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:08,230
the last 12 months I'm new to

00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:11,410
open-source community and I've really

00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:13,210
been ramping up across and wow there's

00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:16,900
so much open-source technology across

00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:19,869
theá-- infrastructure and the the

00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:21,700
application dev side so as I've been

00:59:19,869 --> 00:59:23,650
ramping up on that role I've been

00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:26,230
looking forward to how do I tell the

00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:28,450
journey of where Microsoft has come from

00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:30,190
where they were and there's a few talks

00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:32,260
that my colleagues have already kind of

00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:33,640
done and they've done dusta too but in

00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:36,220
the five minutes I wanted to kind of

00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:38,619
share some stats my thoughts and share

00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:41,680
some stories that kind of tell the same

00:59:38,619 --> 00:59:45,640
story so one um you know how many people

00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:47,710
are aware that now Linux runs as Linux

00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:49,630
runs on the azure cloud just to show

00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:52,059
hands so generally most of the folk

00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:53,980
no that's that's Pleasant and this week

00:59:52,059 --> 00:59:57,460
we add ignite the big conference going

00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:59,920
on in Orlando as the MVP mentioned we

00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:02,140
released that's that 50% of Asia is

00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:05,829
Linux base VM so that's that's a nice

01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:07,930
milestone the other thing is there's

01:00:05,829 --> 01:00:10,390
three pillars to how we do open source

01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:12,279
at Microsoft one is sort of enablement

01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:15,460
and integration and what that means is

01:00:12,279 --> 01:00:17,319
the choice and flexibility to bring your

01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:19,690
choice of the mix VMs I believe there's

01:00:17,319 --> 01:00:22,720
about six distributions today support it

01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:24,849
on there and it is a first-class citizen

01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:26,380
experience so it's not about hey you

01:00:24,849 --> 01:00:28,180
throw it on there but story if you want

01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:29,589
to do backup I don't know what what

01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:31,180
you're gonna do sorry if you want to do

01:00:29,589 --> 01:00:32,890
networking I don't know wait that's not

01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:34,869
really the case it will work just as

01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:36,400
well as a Windows server and so that's

01:00:34,869 --> 01:00:38,950
really what the first pillar is about

01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,839
the next one is called your release and

01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:43,869
this is where Microsoft is making

01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:46,269
investments to release open source code

01:00:43,869 --> 01:00:48,130
and projects vs code is a popular

01:00:46,269 --> 01:00:51,130
developer tool if you're aware of it and

01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:53,140
that's an investment that we've made and

01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:54,970
released into the community in the last

01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:57,970
year I believe it on github beta had

01:00:54,970 --> 01:01:00,849
over 15,000 contributions so it's a

01:00:57,970 --> 01:01:03,160
pretty popular big project and and then

01:01:00,849 --> 01:01:05,410
the third product Hillier of how we do

01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:08,549
open source at Microsoft is contributed

01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:10,690
and what this one is about is ok

01:01:08,549 --> 01:01:13,150
Microsoft you know all those you're

01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:15,339
saying there's a the fun status there's

01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:17,109
about 20,000 employees at Microsoft in

01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:18,819
the on the github making contributions

01:01:17,109 --> 01:01:20,740
and aren't you just kind of doing that

01:01:18,819 --> 01:01:22,059
to your own products or making your own

01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:24,849
products work with the open source

01:01:22,059 --> 01:01:26,650
ecosystem yes there's some of those the

01:01:24,849 --> 01:01:29,319
other one is some of the projects we're

01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:31,420
releasing such as vs code or typescript

01:01:29,319 --> 01:01:33,490
or powershell as open source and the

01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:35,819
third pillar is really going back and

01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:39,369
giving to the community and improving

01:01:35,819 --> 01:01:41,170
products in the ecosystem that we didn't

01:01:39,369 --> 01:01:43,720
start or create for the sake of

01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:46,089
improving that ecosystem so I I'm not a

01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:48,640
part of that team but I'm really proud

01:01:46,089 --> 01:01:50,410
of some 20,000 engineers across all of

01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:52,029
Microsoft they're really kind of

01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:55,930
contributing in sort of those three

01:01:52,029 --> 01:01:57,549
spaces and then some other front stats I

01:01:55,930 --> 01:02:01,059
think we've made over two million

01:01:57,549 --> 01:02:03,340
commits in github on open source I'm

01:02:01,059 --> 01:02:05,590
proud to say we were in the era

01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:07,870
were attracting talent so one of the

01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:09,490
reasons I hear big about folks getting

01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:10,990
into open source or as I work with their

01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:12,970
enterprise customers that are looking to

01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:15,220
get into open source technology is for

01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:17,680
reasons of talent hiring you guys are in

01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:19,420
demand out there there is the whole

01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:21,280
ecosystem of languages and frameworks

01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:23,770
that the open source community has

01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:26,080
created is what the new generation and

01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:27,910
the Millennials are really adopting

01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:30,610
really fast you know I'll say things

01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:33,040
like the nodejs developers and things

01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:35,320
like that and what what the

01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:37,360
organizations that I work with want to

01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:39,580
do is they want to hire that talent and

01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:41,500
they don't want to spend years and

01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:42,610
months building some legacy software

01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:44,410
that you know only one person

01:02:42,610 --> 01:02:46,180
understands and if they get hit by a bus

01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:48,010
the whole organization's kind of screwed

01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:50,110
so they really want that sort of

01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:52,930
community support and it's the same

01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:55,000
reason we're doing it another talk I

01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:56,950
heard recently was by a Microsoft

01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,890
engineer she started with us as a

01:02:56,950 --> 01:03:01,630
college new hire and she said you know

01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:03,670
it's a really funny story for me to go

01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:05,560
out to tell people but I actually didn't

01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:08,110
know what open source were was and as

01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:10,350
part of her onboarding experience she

01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:12,640
was put into her containers team and

01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:14,020
Microsoft taught me open source and

01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:16,210
she's only been with us for the last

01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:19,300
four or five years so that's kind of an

01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:21,460
interesting piece as well and the last

01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:23,260
one is we've been doing it for long

01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:28,340
we've been making contributions to the

01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:30,730
limits kernel since 2009 thank you

01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:33,859
[Music]

01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:36,950
and appropriately that brings us to a

01:03:33,859 --> 01:03:38,599
close with Daniel's broken code again so

01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:40,460
thank you for joining us for this

01:03:38,599 --> 01:03:43,160
hour-long talk on what you can teach me

01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:45,380
about apache MX net hive male CloudStack

01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:47,660
shooting ozone turbine geospatial

01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:50,240
effects of enterprise functions at

01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:51,470
Microsoft swag and we'll see you in the

01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:58,480
morning

01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:58,480
