all right we're gonna do a quick survey

00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:06,750
before I start and it's related to what

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,700
cliff was just talking about how many of

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,710
you think that global poverty in the

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,880
last 25 years has gone up or down we'll

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,410
start with aa

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,880
how many people think there is more

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,539
global poverty in the world than there

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,609
was 25 years ago how many people think

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,279
that there's less global poverty in the

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:25,220
world than there was 25 years ago

00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:27,750
your castrations you guys are right

00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,599
global poverty has been declining in

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:34,800
fact 1 billion people have exited

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:38,899
poverty since the year 2000 so we are

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,899
making progress we're doing good work

00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:45,000
this is going to sound like an odd segue

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,800
we're gonna go from global poverty to

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,850
interest compounding what do these two

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,920
things have to do with each other

00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:57,629
first off in computer science we like to

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:59,309
avoid Exponential's this is one we don't

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,980
want to avoid sometimes Exponential's

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,809
are a good thing this is a very simple

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,049
example it's ten percent interest over

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,930
40 cycles so for example 40 years you

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:13,140
can see that your initial investment

00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:17,390
multiplies by a factor of 40 over those

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:22,979
40 cycles and you might be thinking okay

00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:25,830
yeah I know this stuff but have you ever

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:28,710
wondered what the underlying fundamental

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:32,250
of that is like why banks can pay out

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:34,860
interest that compounds over time like

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,460
this well it's because there's an

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:43,860
underlying economy that increases in

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:46,970
this way this principle actually

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:50,100
underlies the course of modern history

00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,990
for the last 200 years so if you look

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,140
here you've got three lines the yellow

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:59,219
line is the number of people living

00:01:54,140 --> 00:02:01,200
under for under $2 a day the red line is

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,469
the number of people living under $1 a

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,670
day

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:04,200
and the black line is the number of

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,990
people living under a dollar ninety a

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,349
day this is inflation adjusted this is

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:13,050
since 1820 so this is the last 200 years

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:15,180
as you can see global poverty has been

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,200
going down not just going down a little

00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:21,840
bit it's been going down dramatically in

00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,910
1820 94% of people were living for under

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,050
$2 a day and that's pretty much all of

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:31,710
you the world is changing and it's

00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:35,670
changing for the better by the end of

00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:37,290
2018 we expect that number down at the

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:41,280
lower left we expected to hit eight

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:43,200
point six percent why is that happening

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,090
why have we managed to make so much

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,940
progress over the last 200 years well

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:52,200
that's the Industrial Revolution

00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:55,050
what is the Industrial Revolution well

00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,700
we've made innovations and changes that

00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:00,900
build on each other each little thing

00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:03,240
increases the value of the thing before

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,190
it and can be spread out into new ideas

00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,620
and new manufacturing processes and

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,950
solving new problems and doing that for

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,860
200 years turns out can be massively

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,380
effective innovation builds on

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,630
innovation step by step over the last

00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:25,260
200 years that is the power of

00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:27,500
compounding interest so why does that

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,500
work

00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:36,170
why can we continue building ideas on

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,080
ideas and this gets back to something

00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:41,450
that Apache does this is about community

00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,930
this is about communication this is

00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,790
about the free flow of information you

00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:49,040
can't build on idea if you haven't heard

00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:53,390
it and this actually goes back to Chris

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,580
project too with Amplio the exchange of

00:03:53,390 --> 00:04:01,480
ideas among people striving towards a

00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:01,480
common goal is the key to innovation

00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,830
sometimes we like to point to geniuses

00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,660
we like to say this guy or that guy was

00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,940
so smart and took us forward so far but

00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:15,860
the real key here is the way all of us

00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:17,299
interact with each other in order to do

00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,760
that we need to trust each other and we

00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:21,799
need to know each other the key words

00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,400
here our community and trust and those

00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:28,160
things together is social capital and

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:32,030
you can use social capital to build real

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,740
capital and not only enjoy the nice

00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:39,440
things of this world but enjoy them

00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:40,940
together with other people community is

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,540
something we know about it Apache you

00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:47,510
sahabat runs talked this morning

00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:49,340
community is the key it is the guiding

00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,229
principle at Apache all of the decisions

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:57,140
the Board makes go back to community

00:04:51,229 --> 00:05:00,200
over code which is why we keep doing it

00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:03,530
you saw the introduction these are the

00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:06,280
projects since 2000 we have been growing

00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:09,880
the number of projects exponentially and

00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,900
projects in this case means communities

00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,700
but where are we talking about global

00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:18,290
poverty so what does all this have to do

00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:22,760
with global poverty remember we're

00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:24,590
trying to bring well-being to the last

00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,030
eight point six percent of the global

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,580
population we want to bring those people

00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:30,560
out of poverty it's dense reason that

00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,870
what we really want to do is to

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,330
integrate those people into the global

00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,430
economy and by that I don't mean we want

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,630
new consumers we don't we're not looking

00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,190
for new borrowers we're not looking for

00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,770
cheap labor because we've learned in our

00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:45,699
projects that each new person

00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:48,139
that comes to the table brings new ideas

00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:54,590
they bring something that we can all

00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:56,930
benefit from but in order for the global

00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:59,539
poor to participate fully in the global

00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,400
economy they first need to be partners

00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:02,720
in their local economy so I'm going to

00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,120
ask a couple more questions at this

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,009
point

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:11,770
how many of you have taken out loans to

00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:15,759
pay for college me too

00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:17,530
to pay for some other kind of investment

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,550
yeah

00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:23,930
how many of you are saving for

00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:25,580
retirement all right here's the one to

00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,259
see if you're paying attention how many

00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:44,090
of you paid for your flight to Apache

00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:45,620
Con with cash somebody did Wow most of

00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,270
you guys paid ahead of time and you

00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,719
couldn't have done it without baking

00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:52,280
services it sounds really banal but it's

00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:54,169
not banal for the people who don't have

00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,020
it two and a half billion people on this

00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:59,150
planet do not have banking services and

00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:02,740
these banking services are the key to

00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:07,130
the door for economic participation

00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:11,539
things like sending money receiving

00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:13,279
money borrowing money saving money all

00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:16,880
of these things are much harder to do

00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:22,000
without a bank things like paying for an

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:24,409
education or vaccines or fertilizer

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,469
smoothing over unexpected bumps in the

00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:29,419
roads or starting a business these

00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:32,449
things are much harder without money

00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:36,050
transfers savings accounts or loans with

00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:38,870
reasonable interest rates now this is

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:41,990
not an easy problem for people often

00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:45,380
aren't attractive customers they can't

00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:48,229
keep a minimum balance or they can't

00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,470
even afford an account fee and they

00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:52,260
often live in

00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,670
that are off the beaten tracks that are

00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:58,170
hard to reach and have minimal

00:07:53,670 --> 00:08:03,950
infrastructure but fortunately they have

00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:06,630
communities and banking isn't magic

00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:11,520
banking underlying banking it has some

00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:16,740
simple principles so what does community

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:18,120
banking look like Cara's had actually

00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:22,020
working on something called savings

00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:24,600
groups savings groups is community

00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:27,390
lending by the community for the

00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,980
community Moores more concretely more

00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,830
specifically what does the savings group

00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:34,110
well a group of people gets together

00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:36,539
they get themselves a box like this one

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:38,780
here it usually has two or three locks

00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:42,870
on it and they get themselves a ledger

00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:45,000
and they get together and they think

00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,830
about how they want to conduct their

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,290
savings group they make some rules they

00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:51,530
elect a treasurer they decide who's

00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:54,300
going to keep the keys to the boss and

00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:57,330
all of them put a little bit of money

00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,280
into the box and nobody has to be rich

00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,630
to be able to do this they just need to

00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,790
have a little bit of money that they can

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:04,740
put into this box and then they meet

00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,600
every week and every week they save a

00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,670
little bit more money but they don't

00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,020
just save they get together and they

00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,839
decide what they're going to do with

00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,070
that money so maybe there's somebody in

00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:16,080
the community who is starting a business

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,480
or maybe there's somebody in the

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,130
community who has a sick child and needs

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,740
to take some time off in order to take

00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:24,510
care of that sick child so they can go

00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,760
and they can say well you're starting a

00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:29,310
business we can give you a loan with

00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,750
this interest rate so that you can buy

00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,760
the things that you need to build up

00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,800
this business and you can pay us back

00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,500
before the end of the cycle or we can

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,970
say we know that you're having trouble

00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,120
with your sick child we can give you an

00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:47,370
interest-free loan to help you bridge

00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:49,110
this difficult time and at the end of

00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,330
that time period it can be a half a year

00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,370
or a year the group decides they get

00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,630
together they see how much people paid

00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,070
in and they split the money that's in

00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:58,380
the box back out among the people who

00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,720
paid in and they decide who gets how

00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,250
much money based on how much people paid

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,420
in so

00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:06,830
this is where the ledger comes in they

00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:11,300
can also decide if they want to go for

00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:13,280
another round because the people seeking

00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:17,090
these loans are seeking it from people

00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:19,520
they know the people who are in the

00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:22,520
savings group know if the people are

00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,020
credit worthy they they don't need any

00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,100
extra information beyond what they

00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:28,420
already know this is called in the

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:33,950
banking industry kyc know your customer

00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:36,340
know Equifax necessary because the

00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:39,100
savings group only gets its money back

00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:41,960
if the borrower's can repay the

00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,180
community has an extra incentive to help

00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,910
these businesses succeed it goes beyond

00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,680
just making sure that the interest terms

00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,210
are reasonable it also goes on to

00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,940
material help they can give them advice

00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:54,920
they can buy at those stores they have

00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,960
an incentive not to go to the next town

00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:01,700
to get whatever it is they're looking

00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:03,320
for and the people starting these

00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,670
businesses also have an incentive to be

00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,140
open to their communities about the

00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:09,010
challenges they're facing so that they

00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,010
can be helped

00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:14,750
savings groups can also decide where

00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,850
they're going to put the money based on

00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,800
the interest of the community as a whole

00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,810
so they can look for those long-term

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:25,850
investments that bring them forward as a

00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:27,410
community the best because as cliff

00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,540
pointed out before these communities

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:31,270
have a great deal of native intelligence

00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,589
and knowledge about their problems

00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:37,330
they're the ones that are best able to

00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:37,330
make decisions about what they need

00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:43,640
savings groups are also transparent so

00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:46,610
the amount of money that each person

00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:48,320
pays in is recorded on a ledger and that

00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:52,760
ledger is available to be looked at by

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:55,190
everybody in the savings group the Box

00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,960
the money in the box is only looked at

00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,250
or the box is only opened when everybody

00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:02,120
is there together that's why there's

00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:03,500
multiple locks on the box and all of the

00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:08,870
decisions are made with everybody

00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:10,370
present so community communities that

00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:12,290
are building savings groups are building

00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,510
more than just physical capital which is

00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:17,900
important they're also building

00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:19,670
social capital they're putting

00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,200
themselves in a position to profit as a

00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:26,450
community from this principle of

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:29,660
compounding interest these ideas are new

00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:32,210
savings groups have existed in one form

00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,580
or another for over 2,000 years this

00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:37,400
idea actually came out of Africa these

00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:41,390
there is a word in over 100 languages

00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:45,070
for savings groups so for example Tunde

00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:50,330
is in Latin America Chama and Swahili

00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:52,220
Susu and the Caribbean what I'm

00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,840
describing here is a specific form of

00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:58,220
savings groups that's being spread by

00:12:53,840 --> 00:13:00,050
the group called care and care has been

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,510
building on those previous innovations

00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:05,210
and refining them care started their

00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:06,530
work in the early 90s and they've been

00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,450
steadily developing the method ever

00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:12,220
since there's also been researched by

00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,220
another group called the seep network

00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,510
they've been looking into how effective

00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,250
the savings groups are that that

00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,620
research was funded by the Bill and

00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,750
Melinda Gates Foundation and what they

00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:27,260
found is that savings groups increased

00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:30,590
asset ownership without decreasing the

00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:32,690
amount of people that money spend they

00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:35,750
found that savings groups increased food

00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:37,460
security they increase the amount of

00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:41,600
money that people spend on primary

00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:43,160
education and the effects over the short

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,620
time period and they measured over two

00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,930
years are fairly small but they're

00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:50,330
measurable and we just talked about how

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:54,470
small effects can add up on top of each

00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:57,200
other and compound over time there's

00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:59,000
also another similar idea called joint

00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,510
liability groups and this is an idea

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,190
that got its start in India unlike

00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:07,280
savings group joints like the joint

00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,960
liability groups often involve banks or

00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,320
something called a microfinance

00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:17,270
institution sometimes involving a field

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:19,100
agent from a bank banks give little

00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:22,280
loans in the case of joint liability

00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,130
groups little loans to a person in a

00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,880
community that person in the community

00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:29,200
shows that they can pay it back

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,460
by gathering the community around them

00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,700
and everybody in the community together

00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:35,290
says yes that person is trustworthy you

00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,330
can lend to that person they're

00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:42,550
basically using their social capital as

00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:44,380
a form of collateral just as in the case

00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:46,750
of savings groups people can use these

00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:49,570
loans to make long-term investments to

00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:53,620
build up businesses which will then help

00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:57,460
them exit poverty the Grameen Foundation

00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:59,530
has found that less than 1% or the

00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:01,990
credit rate off for these loans is 1%

00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:03,970
and the average overdue rate is between

00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:06,250
3 and 6 percent so there's widely held

00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:10,650
belief that poor people are not the best

00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,650
people to loan money to this is not true

00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:16,450
poor people can be credit worthy there's

00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:19,210
also a concern that poor people that it

00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:21,760
could be abusive to loan money to poor

00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:26,440
people the Grameen Foundation has found

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:28,540
that microfinance can in fact lift

00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,210
people out of poverty those that

00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:33,580
remained Grameen foundation customers

00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:41,410
over a course of at least five years of

00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:43,060
those 55% exited poverty and because of

00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:46,300
the tremendous amount of good that this

00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:48,100
idea does the Grameen foundation or

00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,330
rather the Grameen Bank together with

00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,030
Muhammad Yunus

00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:57,760
receives the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004

00:15:52,030 --> 00:16:00,280
for this groundbreaking work so I've

00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,260
been going on here about community and

00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,640
banking but you may be wondering at this

00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,320
point what this has to do with you

00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:10,420
because we're here at an open-source

00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:12,490
conference right well what I've been

00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:15,630
describing has a lot to do a lot in

00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:15,630
common with the Apache Way

00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:24,200
it's charitable when savings groups make

00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:26,660
sure that their members can get through

00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,339
hard times with interest-free loans or

00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,680
even absorb those costs if the people

00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:32,060
fail to pay back the loans then they are

00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:38,209
making sure that the weakest in their

00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:40,670
community are not left behind it's

00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:42,529
community centered people are getting

00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:46,399
together in their savings groups as a

00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:48,920
community sometimes somebody from

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,959
outside a field agent comes in to

00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,520
educate them but the decisions are there

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,800
is they decide who's the treasurer and

00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:57,490
they decide what the rules are and they

00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,380
decide who to lend money to the

00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:05,030
community sets the direction it makes

00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:07,970
all of the decisions and they make those

00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:09,770
decisions based on consensus they decide

00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,839
together who is credit worthy that they

00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:18,100
side together who will help lead their

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:22,309
groups savings groups are meritocratic

00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:24,410
so when they decide who will be their

00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:26,780
treasurer when they decide who they want

00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,189
to lend money to they do so based on

00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:32,470
their knowledge of these people their

00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:36,559
knowledge of their merit in this system

00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:40,040
and savings groups and joint liability

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,660
groups our transparent remember I said

00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,760
they keep all of their records on a

00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,559
ledger that everybody can look at they

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,820
only open the box when everybody is

00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:48,620
together so that everybody knows

00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,080
everybody has all of the information

00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:55,610
about what the savings group is doing

00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:58,670
and what it has this transparency

00:17:55,610 --> 00:18:02,260
promotes trust and the trust is what

00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:04,760
makes the collaboration possible and

00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,410
savings groups are pragmatic we're

00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,880
talking about a group of people who

00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:13,130
doesn't have time to mess around with

00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,720
exotic ideas or strange directions

00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:18,830
they're going to focus on the problems

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,990
they have and solving those problems and

00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:23,240
in doing so they also focus on the

00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:25,960
social bonds that they need in order to

00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,960
reach these goals

00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,779
now you see this is the Apache way and

00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,399
if you'd like to learn more about the

00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:34,519
Apache way you can either visit this

00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:36,169
website here or you can go to the talks

00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:37,730
on Thursday that are invited to be

00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:42,559
there's a community track going on on

00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:43,789
Thursday about the Apache way but

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,700
savings groups and joint liability

00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:50,990
groups share more than just culture with

00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:53,330
the open source communities because

00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:57,200
software can be used to support these

00:18:53,330 --> 00:19:00,169
processes to keep community records and

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,419
to do interest calculations we can

00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:06,710
support these communities ourselves as

00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:08,149
one community to another and this is

00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:10,850
where my project comes in I'm working on

00:19:08,149 --> 00:19:14,539
a project called Apache finner act at

00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:16,610
Apache Fenner Act we do exactly that we

00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:18,260
create software to support joint

00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,730
liability groups and we're moving in the

00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:24,470
direction of supporting savings groups

00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:26,299
as well our project relies on your

00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,039
projects and you see I've listed a

00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:30,320
handful of the projects that we're using

00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:32,389
these are all open source projects and

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,919
I'm sure there's at least one person and

00:19:32,389 --> 00:19:35,450
probably many people in this room who

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,960
have contributed to these projects

00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:41,090
directly or indirectly so when you're

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,159
working on your project and you're

00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,389
scratching your own itch because you

00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:46,309
have a problem that you want to solve

00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:49,730
but you're doing it in an open and

00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:53,919
generous way you're also helping people

00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,919
you may not realize that you're helping

00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:00,950
Apache chief interact started at the

00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,779
Grameen foundation under the name me

00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,760
fossa and it's made its way to the

00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:08,149
Apache Software Foundation first an

00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:11,330
incubation in 2015 and then we made it

00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:13,750
to a top-level project in 2017 so we're

00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:15,950

00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:40,130
