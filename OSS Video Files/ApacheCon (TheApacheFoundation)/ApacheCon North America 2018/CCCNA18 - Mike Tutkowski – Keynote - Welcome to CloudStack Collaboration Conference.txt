alright alright everybody so welcome to

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,980
the Claude stat collaboration conference

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,900
here in Montreal I know this is our

00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:21,210
second time we've been in Montreal in

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,890
the past couple years so it's always

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:28,680
nice for me to get a chance to come out

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:32,189
here and see everybody again let's see

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:35,100
so just a little bit above me I'm miked

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,410
up Kowski I've been in the cloud stack

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,230
community for about six years now

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:43,500
actually this coming November would be

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:47,510
six years for me I've been the VP of

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:50,700
cloud snacks since March or April and

00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:53,730
usually that's just a like a yearly kind

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,309
of stint that we elect somebody into so

00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:00,420
next marks are in April we'll be moving

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:03,539
on to the next VP the last six years

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,780
I've actually been a full time cloud

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:09,380
stack software engineer I started at a

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:14,490
startup company in Boulder Colorado

00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:15,689
doing cloud stack full time SolidFire

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,450
was the name of the company

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,340
it was later acquired by NetApp a few

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,979
years ago but I've been very fortunate

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,920
to be able to continue on in that role

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:28,229
these past three years it's been a

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,659
really good experience I love working

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:34,469
with the community and making it out all

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,869
these events as I do work for a storage

00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:39,630
company you can kind of see 0.3 I've

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,959
been mainly focused on cloud stack

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:46,109
storage component over the past five six

00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:48,679
years especially around quality of

00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:51,840
service and and bringing that kind of

00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:53,759
capabilities into cloud stack more

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,489
generally I've been in the storage

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,340
industry for about 12 years and 20 years

00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:01,919
as a software engineer so that's just a

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,499
little bit about me let's take a look at

00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:08,429
some quick to notices really there's

00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:11,670
just a couple I'm drea panics right

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:14,060
there in the fourth row back he's got a

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,980
really great presentation

00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,410
fully running enterprise workloads with

00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:21,260
cloud stack KBM and managed primary

00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:24,890
storage it was originally going to be at

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:28,849
2:30 tomorrow in this room we've

00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:31,880
actually moved it up to 11:05 but it's

00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:34,489
the same day same room so that I really

00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,980
encourage people to consider going to

00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:40,190
that presentation he did a great job in

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:42,140
Berlin a few few months ago I especially

00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:45,290
like the fact that it was a joint

00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:47,840
presentation but he did 98 percent of

00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,120
the work so it was really really easy on

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,060
me so come check out

00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:57,410
Andres presentation tomorrow that does

00:02:53,060 --> 00:03:00,110
leave an open slot I 2:30 tomorrow so

00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:03,799
I'm actually going to see if anybody has

00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:06,110
any CloudStack oriented talks that

00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:07,489
they'd like to consider doing tomorrow

00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:11,569
at 2:30

00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:13,400
come come either see me or maybe you can

00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:16,580
find one of the other guys Giles surrett

00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,470
up front a lot of you know him but it

00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,829
would be really great to have somebody

00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:26,600
fill in for that 2:30 slot tomorrow it's

00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:29,540
in this room so Tuesday this room 2:30

00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,769
so either let me know or maybe Giles or

00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:35,660
somebody else who you're kind of

00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:38,600
familiar with let's see so yeah welcome

00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:42,019
to Montreal just a couple quick facts

00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:44,650
about the city it's the second largest

00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:47,180
french-speaking city in the world which

00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:50,239
I've actually was fortunate enough to be

00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,190
in both now the first the first most

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,840
populous french-speaking country in the

00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,780
world this year I was in Paris for a

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,829
couple of weeks and over the summer and

00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,470
now I get a chance to come out to

00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:02,840
Montreal it's a maybe a little known

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,940
fact that French was my minor in college

00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,100
although I've never actually used it in

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,690
my professional life it's kind of nice

00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,730
to be able to come out to cities like

00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:13,670
this and and get a chance to speak a

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,270
little bit of French so I always like

00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:18,260
coming out

00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:21,050
to Montrell anyways it has a second

00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,340
highest number of restaurants per capita

00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:25,190
so I guess we won't have any trouble

00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:28,160
finding any food around here there's a

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:30,020
lot of foreign students there 18,000

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,420
foreign students from 150 different

00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,580
countries and actually yesterday we were

00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:37,580
just at supper a bunch of us and I

00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:40,550
noticed her on the table across from us

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,740
was a collection of students from Mexico

00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,710
so good to see that kind of firsthand

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,270
that there was a large population of

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:51,350
students from different countries which

00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:55,160
is always really cool for me to see one

00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:57,650
special mention here is for cloud ops

00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,950
which is a company that's very prevalent

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:03,200
in the cloud stack community so cloud

00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,310
apps is located in Montreal I've worked

00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,370
with those guys

00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:09,230
Ian's array and a whole bunch of them

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,270
for the past five six years almost the

00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:13,700
whole time that I've been in the cloud

00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:16,040
stack community so it's kind of nice to

00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:19,640
be able to come out to their home city

00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,570
and get a chance to see those guys face

00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,970
to face again

00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,640
they actually hosted the cloud stack

00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:29,090
collaboration conference two years ago

00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:32,060
so 2016 at their headquarters here in

00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:34,700
Montreal so it's nice to be able to be

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:37,250
back to see those guys in their home

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,480
city and the last little point there I

00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,210
guess that's probably the only place

00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:45,860
we'll see all four these guys in the

00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:47,660
same flag at the same time so cool so

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,700
let's take a look just a quick overview

00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:52,670
of the cloud stack collaboration

00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:55,810
conference and its history this also

00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:59,540
includes some of the cloud stack day's

00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:01,820
events that we're going on in 2015 so

00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:06,110
you can see that we actually go back as

00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:08,090
far as 2012 that was the first clouds

00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,650
that collaboration conference and not

00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:12,080
only was that the first clouds that

00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:15,230
collaboration conference that was day

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,600
two for me at SolidFire so my first day

00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:20,870
was coming into the office picking up my

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,419
laptop and flying out to Las Vegas day 2

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,550
was participating in the clouds that

00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:28,060
collaboration conference so that's

00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:30,830
that's kind of a really big one for me

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:33,169
we kind of followed that up with Santa

00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:35,120
Clara the next year and I remember that

00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:38,630
one in particular because that was when

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:42,530
I was getting my first code commit into

00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:45,020
the cloud stack repo so that one I kind

00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,960
of distinctly remember as well we had a

00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,960
ton of great ones we went to Amsterdam

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:53,600
and followed by Denver I'm actually

00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,940
wearing the Denver Apache con cloud

00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,060
stack conference one that one is for me

00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:00,410
particularly interesting because

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,600
SolidFire is headquartered in Boulder

00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:05,120
Colorado which is only about 30 minutes

00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,919
from Denver so it was kind of a weird

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,130
one for me because I didn't actually get

00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:11,840
to go to some exotic place to go to the

00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:14,240
conference it was basically just a

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,400
30-minute Drive and I had to fight with

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,440
traffic and get into the parking garage

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,460
and really would have been just from my

00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,650
point of view and I sort of go to

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:25,460
Amsterdam or something but hey it was

00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:28,220
fun in Denver too let's see we had a

00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,669
whole bunch of them in 2015 most of

00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:33,020
those were actually cloud stat day's

00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:38,300
events those were really fun we did

00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:40,039
those in Austin Tokyo and Seattle you

00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,320
know again just kind of look for more

00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:44,539
exotic places I really enjoyed the Tokyo

00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,940
one that was it was fun to be able to go

00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:49,250
up there and and do a presentation where

00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,169
you know people are translating it into

00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,210
Japanese because there's this large

00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:55,070
Japanese population that comes to of

00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,930
course to the event but they don't

00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:59,419
necessarily speak as much English so

00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,310
that was really a very very bilingual

00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:04,190
kind of operation that we we went

00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:06,979
through there and then we went to Dublin

00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:10,789
later in 2015 that was great Guinness is

00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:13,820
always great as I mentioned we visited

00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:15,680
Montreal just two years ago and now

00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,770
we're back here we were in Florida last

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,419
year and kind of the thing we're looking

00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:22,729
to hopefully kind of not necessarily

00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:25,039
announce here but to put out the ideas

00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:28,449
we're hoping to do a conference next

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,999
year in Brazil so I know we we try

00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:32,949
maybe it was last year and it just

00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:35,979
didn't work out so hopefully this coming

00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:38,229
year I will be doing one in Brazil as we

00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:40,839
can see later on and in one of the slide

00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:42,849
decks Brazil is definitely a big hotspot

00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:44,529
for cloud stacks so and I would just

00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:48,100
personally love to get down to South

00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:50,740
America and get a chance to visit where

00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:54,839
you guys are out of point of these guys

00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:58,740
up front here from Brazil so all right

00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:01,000
so this is not a technical presentation

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,949
this is actually probably my first

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,110
non-technical presentation in the cloud

00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:07,569
stack community but I will mention a

00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:09,399
little bit about virtualization here

00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:11,500
just to kind of make an analogy from my

00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:15,449
next point so we all kind of understand

00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:17,980
this concept around hardware you put the

00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:20,769
hypervisor on top of that or if it's a

00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,779
type 2 hypervisor maybe you put a host

00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:24,550
operating system on there and install

00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:26,470
kvam then you've got your guest

00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:29,470
operating system is stacked kind of

00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:32,079
going for you so that is kind of what

00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:35,500
we're looking at for today's or this

00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:38,439
week's conference venue we've got kind

00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:41,529
of Apache as at our lowest level and on

00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:44,620
top of that is where Apache con sits and

00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:47,079
then we're kind of the guest operating

00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:49,600
system running on top of Apache con so

00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:51,939
off to the left there we got our cloud

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,459
stack collaboration conference so it

00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:57,399
just kind of gives you an idea of what's

00:09:54,459 --> 00:10:00,610
all going on today and where we fit into

00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:02,230
this let's take a look a little bit at

00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:05,709
the time table just to give you a feel

00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:07,779
for where work presentations are going

00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:11,410
to be happening specifically around

00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:14,740
cloud stack so today after this

00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:16,899
presentation we've got two rooms going

00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:21,370
we've got the talks in the ballroom and

00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:23,230
we've got I don't know how to privacy or

00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,779
whatever that is we got two rooms here

00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:27,459
basically going all day I should have

00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:31,860
probably asked Giles what the how you

00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:35,450
pronounce that but I didn't remember so

00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:39,590
so the ballroom and the other one with

00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:41,510
and the sea at the end yeah so to two

00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:44,840
tracks basically going on throughout the

00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:47,000
whole day that's today it's pretty

00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,640
simple just the two tracks tomorrow we

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,140
got some Apache con keynotes that sort

00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,080
of take up the morning up until around

00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:56,540
10:30 and then we're basically back into

00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,520
the same kind of a venue where we've got

00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,080
just the tube all of the ballroom and

00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,650
the other room which I will not say

00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:06,200
again I'm going on throughout the day in

00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:08,300
the evening tomorrow we've got a

00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,550
reception going on at the the beer

00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,280
market so I'd really encourage you to

00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,690
check that out

00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,430
Wednesday is pretty simple from a

00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,010
CloudStack standpoint we've got a

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:22,100
hackathon going on for most of the day

00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:23,690
so that would be great if we could get

00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,920
as many people as possible to kind of

00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:29,660
participate in that we do a lot of these

00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,970
kind of conversations over the mailing

00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,860
list and we do a really good job just

00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,720
kind of communicate communicating with

00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,640
people that way but it's really good to

00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,310
get a chance to actually sit down with

00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,170
everybody who you've typically just been

00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:44,300
speaking with over email the past six

00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:46,310
seven months and just kind of do things

00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,220
face to face sometimes you just get a

00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:51,890
lot more done that way and yeah Thursday

00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:54,020
is all kind of Apache con talks so

00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:56,000
nothing really cloud stacks specific on

00:11:54,020 --> 00:12:00,350
that day but just sort of wanted to

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,920
point that out all right well I wanted

00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:06,800
to thank our sponsors shape blue these

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,110
guys have been I've known them for

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,630
probably the whole six years that I've

00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:15,080
been in the CloudStack community I think

00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:17,990
I've visited Giles and Paul and those

00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:21,730
guys maybe four times in London I was

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:24,710
just at a cloud snack meetup in April

00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:28,340
and I think they just had one last week

00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:30,590
so they do a lot of cloud stack meetups

00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:33,170
and they're really just very active in

00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:35,170
the community so maybe let's give a

00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:37,400
round of applause to Shea blue for

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:41,110
sponsoring the cops that conference

00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:44,870
[Applause]

00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:47,199
alright so yeah just just kind of

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:48,980
mention some of the Twitter handles

00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:51,680
answer maybe going through the

00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:54,100
presentations today and taking some

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,930
pictures making some comments on Twitter

00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:59,930
we're looking to maybe just kind of use

00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:03,110
cloud staff or CCC n18 as our as our

00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:06,730
twitter handles so maybe keep that in

00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:10,819
mind as the as couple days progressed

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:13,129
okay so one year I'm actually referring

00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:14,899
to one year since the last clouds that

00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:18,199
collaboration conference so it's really

00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:20,059
more like I don't know is April of last

00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:23,959
year so it's almost been a year and a

00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:26,660
half so what I go through here is really

00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:28,759
gonna be a little bit of the some of the

00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:32,720
stuff that we've covered in the past

00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:34,550
maybe 16 to 17 months since the last

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,670
cloud stack collaboration conference in

00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:39,649
Miami so what have we been doing we've

00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:42,170
been busy with a lot of releases so

00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:46,699
there's actually been at least four

00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:50,059
major releases in the past 16 months the

00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:52,670
major releases so they pretty much ever

00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:55,910
since CloudStack was donated to the

00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:58,399
Apache Software Foundation the the major

00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:00,350
major release has been four so they all

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,540
kind of start with four but what we

00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:04,579
consider major releases in the community

00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:08,899
at least until we get to five dot X

00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:11,300
release is anything like 4.9 410 so

00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:14,689
we've had actually four major releases

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:18,790
in the past 16 months two of which the

00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:23,329
4.9 and the 4.11 releases are long terms

00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:26,660
support LTS releases so a lots been

00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:29,809
going on in terms of actually releasing

00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:32,269
code that people are using in production

00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:34,910
environments and in fact right now we're

00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:37,429
in the process of working on 4.12

00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,970
and there's what we'll get into some of

00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:40,339
the features

00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:41,899
in a couple slides from now but I guess

00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:44,509
the main takeaway here is there's been a

00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:47,990
lot of good releases where we're still

00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:50,180
developing code very vigorously in the

00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:53,480
CloudStack community so it's it's been a

00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:55,069
great environment ever you know the

00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,819
whole the whole time since our last

00:14:55,069 --> 00:15:00,889
conference so let's just kind of talk

00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:04,490
about 4.11 for a little bit

00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:07,519
this was the it's the most recent LTS

00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:11,300
release and we actually delivered more

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,250
than 250 new capabilities for this

00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,019
particular release I won't go through

00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:18,019
all of these in detail and of course

00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:20,389
that's just a small handful of all of

00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:23,720
the different features that went into

00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:26,629
the release but there was probably a

00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,600
dozen two dozen people working on all of

00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:32,500
these different features and the 4.11

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,209
being an LCS is especially important to

00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,610
customers because in some environments

00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:40,790
they just need to make sure that they're

00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:44,120
installing a software version that is

00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:47,740
going to be continuously revved over the

00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:51,769
coming years and so a lot of times

00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:54,050
releases like 4.9 4.11 the LCS is they

00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:56,509
are especially critical to the cloud

00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:58,850
stack community's success and it's great

00:15:56,509 --> 00:16:02,240
to be able to see that we were able to

00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:05,480
update not just this new 4.11 release

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,100
but also go back and update 4.9 so I

00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,339
think the community's been very

00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:13,129
successful in in their releases over the

00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:15,980
past year and a half let's just take a

00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:17,660
look so some of the just an example of

00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,079
an improvement there's been many many

00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,699
improvements but one of them that was

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:26,329
kind of especially critical from a very

00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:29,389
general standpoint is improvement in how

00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:30,889
fast a virtual router can reboot I mean

00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:32,449
it sounds like a simple thing just how

00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:34,819
fast you might be able to reboot

00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:39,259
something but in this case we actually

00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:41,300
were able to drop the time down from you

00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:45,949
know almost two minutes on VMware to 20

00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:49,329
seconds 44 seconds on KBM to around 26

00:16:45,949 --> 00:16:51,819
seconds and with XenServer around 3 min

00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:54,100
it's down to 30 seconds so this is

00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:55,959
especially important around upgrades and

00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,269
things where you're consistently having

00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:00,249
to reboot these kind of devices so this

00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:03,129
is just a very nice user experience

00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:04,929
improvement and it's just one sample of

00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:08,380
a lot of the improvements that have gone

00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:10,809
in over the past year year and a half as

00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:14,110
I mentioned we're really busy with 4.12

00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:16,360
and this is again just a sample of some

00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:18,339
of the features that are going into it

00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,970
in fact some of these people will

00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:23,019
actually be giving specific

00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:26,039
presentations about for example the

00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:29,019
backup and recovery framework I think

00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:34,059
Paul is let's see Paul I think you're

00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:35,740
doing that one right yeah and we have a

00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:38,409
whole bunch of really interesting

00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:41,049
features that have gone in already to

00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:42,909
the 4.12 release now we're not exactly

00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:45,159
sure when this particular release is

00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:46,840
going to go GA but it's just good to see

00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:50,049
that we just kind of picked up where we

00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:53,409
left off by 4.11 we just kept that same

00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:55,450
momentum going into 4.12 and we've got a

00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:58,600
whole bunch of features already in the

00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:00,850
works so so that's always great to see

00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:05,860
now let's talk a little bit about cloth

00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:07,929
stack adoption the whole iceberg thing

00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,159
maybe some of you already know kind of

00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:12,279
where we're going out with that with

00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:14,679
this but I'll get to that in a moment

00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:17,019
let's first see if anybody knows what

00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:20,740
these numbers might indicate either any

00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:25,720
guesses it's all around cloth stack and

00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:31,000
adoption is a hint 2:19 anybody have an

00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:32,019
idea the users okay so good what I'm not

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,639
gonna say what they're they're right or

00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:37,269
wrong here I'm gonna go to the next page

00:18:33,639 --> 00:18:40,590
all right how about the hundred and

00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:40,590
sixteen thousand

00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:51,780
maybe how about 21,000 anybody on now

00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:55,050
users okay let's just see what it

00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:59,370
actually is all right so our known user

00:18:55,050 --> 00:19:01,230
list is actually 219 and that's what we

00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:04,590
were referring to is kind of that tip of

00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:07,080
the iceberg it's been really common in

00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:09,630
my experience and I've talked to many

00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,070
people at chez blue and cloud ops and a

00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,980
whole bunch of people throughout the

00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:17,580
class that community there's a lot more

00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:19,950
than 219 CloudStack users running and

00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:23,010
production but this is the known list

00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:25,140
one of the main issues we we have and

00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:28,070
I'll get to it in a later slide is that

00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:32,040
people once they try out cloud stack

00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:34,380
they're not always necessarily willing

00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:37,650
to advertise that they use it for either

00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:40,530
competitive reasons or whatever so we

00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:42,060
have a lot of reasons we've heard from

00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:44,400
people over the years while they can't

00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,720
kind of say that they're using it

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,470
publicly

00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,730
which makes this 219 users number much

00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:54,060
smaller than it really is

00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:55,470
in reality so let's take a look at some

00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:58,050
of those other numbers and get a feel

00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:00,510
for what I mean so in the last 12 months

00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,800
our management server packages were

00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:04,350
downloaded that's the hundred and

00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,240
sixteen thousand a number so they're

00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:08,430
they're being downloaded this is just

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,080
over the course of the past year so one

00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:12,510
hundred and sixteen thousand times the

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,990
the management server software itself

00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:19,020
was downloaded and that was from twenty

00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:19,860
one thousand roughly 21,000 different IP

00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,250
addresses

00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:25,860
all around the world so cloud stack is

00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:28,520
definitely being utilized very heavily

00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:31,440
much more so than we would see from that

00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:35,160
219 number so that's the tip of the

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,800
iceberg the real user base is what you

00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:40,560
see or what you don't see rather below

00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:43,980
the the surface of the ocean there let's

00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:46,350
take a quick look at an a map of the

00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:49,190
world just to get a feel for where cloud

00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:52,740
stack is the most is the most downloaded

00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:53,360
I guess the United States ends up being

00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,340
the

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,880
most popular place that it's downloaded

00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:04,210
from but it's also followed closely by

00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:07,640
China Brazil Europe Canada so Russia

00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:10,220
Australia it's all over it's a very big

00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:13,640
distribution of CloudStack across the

00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:16,780
world so it's it's it's very popular

00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:21,620
software even if we can't always get

00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:23,960
users to be be in a position to claim

00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:25,520
that they use it we've heard many

00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,480
different I don't wanna make you call an

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,179
excuse

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,429
over the years but the point of the

00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:35,090
matter is plastic is being used very

00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:38,540
heavily I speak with people in in my job

00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:41,570
and solidfire now it's NetApp many times

00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:45,470
who have tried out things like OpenStack

00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:47,500
and just because of the complication

00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:50,720
they decided to try out cloud stack and

00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,669
they tell me how how happy they are with

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,520
cloud stack so I know that's kind of

00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:57,410
anecdotal in that particular case but it

00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,299
seems like it happens quite regularly in

00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:01,190
my experience and I've talked to people

00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:02,990
from many companies like chez blue cloud

00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:06,140
apps they seem to have the same sort of

00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:10,580
experiences so Claude I've seen a cloud

00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:12,620
stack is very much alive at all I don't

00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,600
really know what to say about this

00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:17,330
particular slide but it's very cool and

00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,730
I think Dawg worked on it quite a bit to

00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:22,850
draw all this data so I'm gonna put it

00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:26,480
up here for a second this is just kind

00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:29,540
of an idea of how our management server

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,980
packages have been downloaded per I

00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:34,600
don't know if it's per month or whatever

00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:37,820
over the past year or so so you can see

00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,460
it's not exactly super easy to come out

00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:43,460
with particular information from this

00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,049
maybe more after a release went out you

00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:48,200
might have seen a heavier number of

00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:50,000
downloads but the slides would be

00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,890
available if anybody wants to take a

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,660
look through this and kind of try to

00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,190
glean it for some more information I

00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:59,270
just thought it was kind of interesting

00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:01,760
to have all of this information let's

00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:04,340
take a look at a quick cartoon this is

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,909
actually on go ahead and read it direct

00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:09,620
but it's the one guy saying that you

00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:14,360
know he doesn't really know anything

00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:16,730
about cloud stack he's not sure what the

00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:20,809
adoption rate is he's a little tentative

00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:23,029
about trying it out in his environment

00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:25,760
and then somebody gets him to do it

00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:27,770
after a few months they've run cloud

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,090
stack very successfully in production

00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:34,279
and then we come back to them and say

00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:36,440
great it's working out would you be okay

00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:39,080
doing a white paper or you know some

00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:43,100
kind of publicity around it and

00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:45,230
unfortunately for the majority of cloud

00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,809
stack users it's something that they

00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:52,460
don't necessarily feel comfortable doing

00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:54,289
so I guess the gist is I really like to

00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:58,220
encourage anybody who is using cloud

00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:59,840
stack in production even in in their

00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,909
development environments to help with

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:05,029
whatever they do for their for their

00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:06,919
business to see if it's something that

00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:10,130
you're able to actually do to announce

00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:11,480
that you use cloud stack because one of

00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:14,720
the things we've always had trouble with

00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:17,570
I think in well maybe Apache in general

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,870
is around marketing most of us are

00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:23,510
mainly interested I know I am in doing

00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:26,419
the technical stuff but it is really

00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:28,190
important if we can do some some work

00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:30,049
around marketing as well and just get

00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:33,380
people to understand that that claw

00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:36,320
stack is well it just works as our as

00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:38,779
our old Twitter tagline used to say

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,669
cloud staff works and it's very it's

00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:45,320
very easy to use compared to many of the

00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:48,860
alternatives so just one little quote

00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:52,309
here kind of that's in line with this we

00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:55,130
had one user recently note that they

00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:58,190
spent four years and just millions of

00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:59,870
dollars installing OpenStack and trying

00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,559
to get their services up and running on

00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:06,559
that and then only recently they decided

00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:08,750
to start again with cloud stack now this

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,940
is not one of my customers but I have

00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:14,090
had probably

00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:18,050
dozen similar experiences in maybe the

00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:20,330
past year or two so yeah it's just very

00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:22,310
interesting around the marketing aspect

00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:25,070
how we just don't get out there and

00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:28,850
market CloudStack but it's really a

00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:32,870
great alternative to many other similar

00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:34,250
products all right cool so at this point

00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:38,690
I'm going to stop talking for a little

00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:40,670
bit we've got three users who are going

00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:43,910
to come up in each do about 10 minutes

00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:45,980
talking a bit about their business what

00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:48,140
they use why they picked CloudStack what

00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,950
they use it for and how that's been

00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:53,960
going for them

00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:57,090
so our first is Mike from Mike they're

00:25:53,960 --> 00:26:00,240
from cloud at sea

00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:00,240
[Applause]

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,229
[Music]

00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:24,499
[Music]

00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,310
all right while he's doing that so my

00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:44,560
name is Mike Guerra I'm the VP of

00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:47,770
product business development at cloud

00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:49,030
that CA just to engage the audience here

00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:53,260
a little bit how many folks are familiar

00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:55,090
with cloud that see a reasonable amount

00:26:53,260 --> 00:27:01,480
people I work with didn't eat to raise

00:26:55,090 --> 00:27:03,280
their hands but all right so what is

00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,680
cloud that's EA so you've heard cloud

00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,690
ops mentioned a couple of times so we

00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:10,710
were actually built and incubated

00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:15,370
originally in cloud up since about 2014

00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:18,130
and coming up on two years ago very very

00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:19,240
soon we were actually pushed out of the

00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:21,250
nest now

00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,950
what does that mean we became a separate

00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:25,810
company a separate legal entity we're

00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:27,550
still very closely associated and worked

00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:30,040
very closely with the folks at cloud ops

00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:33,730
but for all intents and purposes cloud

00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:36,520
dossier is its own separate company what

00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:38,770
do we do we provide cloud infrastructure

00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:41,860
as a service we're essentially share

00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:43,750
machine services we get things like

00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:46,600
manage services for example when we need

00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:50,110
them from partners like cloud ops so in

00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:52,150
that context we provide compute variety

00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:55,060
of flavors running on our compute

00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:58,210
clusters in various data centers in

00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:59,590
addition to multi-tenant compute we're

00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:03,010
also working on it will have very

00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:05,440
shortly bare metal servers as well on

00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:07,990
the storage side we offer a variety of

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,150
flavors of block storage as well as

00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:13,680
object storage so that kind of generally

00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:19,200
rams out what cloud dot CA has and does

00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:19,200
now as all of you are very familiar

00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:25,660
hyperscale

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,460
environment has changed quite a bit over

00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:30,790
the last couple years in fact most of

00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:33,100
the news around cloud these days is

00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:34,150
around hyper scale providers and they've

00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:37,360
all landed here

00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:39,280
Canada as well so in that context why

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,430
should anybody care about cloud that CA

00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:44,980
well cloud that CA is a regional

00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:46,510
Canadian service provider and we believe

00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,940
that even with everything that's

00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:51,070
happened with hyperscale providers this

00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,640
is even more relevant today than it's

00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:55,510
ever been

00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:58,060
why well Canadian data sovereignty we're

00:28:55,510 --> 00:29:01,270
fully Canadian owned fully Canadian

00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:04,180
operated you know and in a world today

00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:07,300
where regulations and regulatory and

00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:10,510
environment is becoming even more common

00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:12,790
even more strict and where we've got a

00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:15,220
bit of a you know somewhat tumultuous

00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:18,130
political climate in various places in

00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,360
the world Canadian data sovereignty is

00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:21,310
something that a lot of people are

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,560
particularly interested in so this is a

00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:25,960
big reason why something like cloud that

00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:29,920
CA matters but there's more to it than

00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:31,990
that when when we meet customers when we

00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,970
work with customers we like to make sure

00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:36,160
they understand then and often this is

00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:37,150
exactly what they're looking for is they

00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,720
can work with us

00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:42,040
as a partner rather than as a vendor

00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,020
we're not somebody who's just taking

00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,520
their money to provide machine services

00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,620
but we're somebody that's working

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,870
closely with them is really vested in

00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:52,720
the success and understanding what each

00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:54,550
of these customers does we can also be a

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,550
bit more flexible in terms of meeting

00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:58,990
their needs if they need some specific

00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:01,030
custom configurations or something a

00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:03,730
little bit out of the ordinary if they

00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:05,770
want to be supported in both official

00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:08,770
languages here both French and English

00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:10,990
we can do that and essentially we build

00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:13,090
relationships with our customers and

00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:14,830
then finally which is something that

00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:17,260
actually matters to to quite a few

00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:19,060
people is they don't have to deal with

00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:21,010
the exchange rate we charge them

00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:24,820
Canadian dollars it's a predictable

00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:31,290
spend no fluctuation on a regular basis

00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:33,970
so how do we work with CloudStack so as

00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:36,380
you can see here we have a variety of

00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:39,320
services in cloud dot CA the lines

00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:42,020
which is orchestrated by CloudStack all

00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:44,450
of our compute our primary block storage

00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:47,300
we also work with Swift stack for our

00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:49,430
object storage and while cloud stack is

00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:52,220
great for why just a lot in terms of

00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:54,470
service orchestration when it comes time

00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,840
to run a business there's a lot more

00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:58,310
that you need to enable the business

00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,130
value that you're delivering this is

00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:03,920
very important to us in cloud CA well

00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:05,390
fortunately from the beginning we're

00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,580
able to work very closely with the team

00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:10,340
at cloud ops and develop something

00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:12,020
called cloud MC so cloud i'm c is the

00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:15,620
layer that you see it's essentially the

00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:18,650
northbound customer facing layer that

00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:20,600
you see on top of the services

00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:22,850
orchestration here and that is

00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:26,690
essentially providing people both their

00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:30,680
UI interface as well as api access to

00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:34,190
provide a lot of the important business

00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:36,530
logic product oriented things that you

00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:39,350
need to be able to run a service

00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:41,180
provider business things like reporting

00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:44,780
things like billing things like access

00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:47,930
control provisioning etc this is all

00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:51,470
built into what we've developed in cloud

00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:53,960
MC and interestingly enough is built in

00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:55,910
a way where not only the things you see

00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,260
here can plug into it but a variety of

00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:59,420
other things like that

00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:02,140
funny OpenStack thing that was mentioned

00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:04,550
earlier as well as even plugging it into

00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:06,650
hyperscale cloud providers so it's quite

00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:09,880
flexible in what it does but this is

00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:13,190
essentially how we leverage cloud stack

00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:16,160
now why clouds that so I've got three

00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:18,110
separate bullets here but in a way

00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:21,410
they're all kind of very intertwined so

00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:24,040
efficiency we felt the cloud stack and

00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:27,200
this is proven out for us would make it

00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:31,280
easier and more efficient for us to be

00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:33,860
able to operate maintain and update our

00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:36,260
cloud environment and in fact this has

00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,700
come to bear for us now part of that

00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:40,040
comes in the fact that we're dealing

00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:42,450
with an open source platform so if we

00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:45,300
hit a problem well we can tackle it

00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:47,070
try and fix it but that we is a lot

00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:50,250
bigger than just us at cloud that CA

00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:52,560
right it's the community when we need

00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:54,480
something sure we can do it ourselves

00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:56,130
but we're a small team we're not a big

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,310
team but we have the power of the

00:32:56,130 --> 00:33:01,320
community to help us out and I think

00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:03,660
over time we've leveraged that community

00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,370
as well as as given back very nicely to

00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,350
that community which we'll we'll talk

00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:09,510
about a little bit more so I think that

00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:12,570
the combination of all of those things

00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:15,720
together made this at the time we chose

00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:17,100
to do it the right choice and given our

00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,890
growth and where we stand today

00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:26,790
definitely continues to be the right

00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:29,640
choice for us and so we contributed and

00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:31,380
been part of a number of projects in the

00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,870
CloudStack community and continue to

00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,700
work on these a lot of these things are

00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:37,860
up here I won't read them all let you go

00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,720
through them I know one of them is

00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,580
actually having a talk the first item

00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,100
there related to the are remote

00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:46,470
management VPNs and how we leverage the

00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,880
itv2 and integration with vault there's

00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:50,670
going to be a talk on that I believe

00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,780
later today but there's a variety of

00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:53,940
things some of which are very

00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:56,160
interesting we're still fine-tuning our

00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:58,410
integration with mass to provide bare

00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,180
metal in cloud ca these are all things

00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:02,340
that we've been working on in some cases

00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:03,960
continue to work on and then we've got a

00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:06,480
whole bunch of other things that we're

00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,270
continuing to work on things like VM

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,850
life cycle improvement so over the life

00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:13,800
of a VM when you deploy it you would

00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:16,350
hope your service provider environment

00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,090
grows a cluster that could be four or

00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:20,430
six hosts

00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:23,490
today could be eight or ten or twelve in

00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:25,350
the future where is that VM end up as

00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:26,700
things grow as you do maintenance as you

00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:29,010
move things around that you might have

00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:32,430
certain constraints maybe people have

00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:35,070
anti affinity rules on that VM maybe it

00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:37,530
has a particular license associated with

00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:39,120
it maybe it's a Windows VM and and it

00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:41,340
needs to be in a certain place or you

00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:43,410
want it to be in a certain place we're

00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:45,990
working on things to improve that and

00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:46,980
automate it so that the life cycle of

00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:49,350
the

00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:52,320
can can be done in a much more efficient

00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:54,540
fashion and isn't more of a manual task

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,610
for our operations team at cloud that CA

00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:59,370
and obviously that's something that as

00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:02,960
part of the community other people will

00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:05,400
be able to leverage over time so

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,380
essentially that is it anybody who's

00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:11,190
interested in cloud dossier wants to try

00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,960
it out trial cloud CA be happy to let

00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,370
you do that

00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:29,820
appreciate it thank you very much and I

00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:34,340
won't hand it off to the next one and

00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:34,340
now we've got the endo from ID elegance

00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:42,079
[Applause]

00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:49,709
[Music]

00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,880
[Music]

00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:02,520
you see okay

00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:05,850
hello welcome so my name is Inga opium

00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:08,250
I'm working for intelligence and I've

00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:11,130
been asked to say something about our

00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:14,160
company what we do with clouds egg and

00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:18,120
why do we do that so just given a quick

00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:20,700
idea of that so we like telchines we

00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:23,460
have several service centers around the

00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:28,410
globe so mostly what we are doing is

00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:31,050
about sa P so we either do work closely

00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:35,510
together with sa P or dealing with a

00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:38,340
zippe software so we help customers to

00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:41,310
do a lifecycle for NCT software

00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:45,870
installing them to project consultancy

00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:48,510
and so on and as well there that comes

00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:52,440
in where we come from that we also have

00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:56,370
an infrastructure on there so that means

00:36:52,440 --> 00:37:00,330
we are hosting ACP systems and our data

00:36:56,370 --> 00:37:03,030
centers globally so we help them to hear

00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:06,330
rock on the special requirements they

00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:09,030
have and and run this and this is where

00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:15,680
we know like what model special needs

00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:18,300
for running an SMP system so funny for a

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,520
infrastructure part so we are helping

00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:24,720
also customers to get all the new

00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:29,700
requirements enough so especially they

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:32,700
have multi hybrids scenarios coming up

00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:34,680
that they need to answer questions to

00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,690
the current questions also how they

00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,810
scale in the future so they have systems

00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:41,850
one side in a data centers and as well

00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:44,790
also in the public cloud

00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:47,580
and they are we have yeah special

00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:49,560
requirements and we know how this all

00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,480
fits together because we know about the

00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:54,540
infrastructure and we also know how the

00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:58,200
applications are one in combination is

00:37:54,540 --> 00:38:01,190
quite important so what are we doing

00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,980
with our clouds so we have I just put

00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:05,869
lots of a subpoena goes here so because

00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:09,710
that's our main focus

00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:11,869
so we from running from production

00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:14,180
systems trainings development and demo

00:38:11,869 --> 00:38:19,369
systems so it's all these different

00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:22,789
rarities so we were using cloud stack to

00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:26,390
easily deploy new installations

00:38:22,789 --> 00:38:27,859
especially let's say for the development

00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:30,650
systems certainly we have like

00:38:27,859 --> 00:38:33,289
developers they need to program an

00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:34,910
add-on for an s AP system but who is

00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:37,910
installing the system for them can where

00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:40,609
they can try out and test so this is

00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:43,539
where we like provide all the

00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:46,099
infrastructure for it doing lots of

00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:48,530
automation to deploy it so there will be

00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:52,339
a talk by tomorrow so I explained that

00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:54,260
more detail how that works and yeah

00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:56,930
seamless there's like training systems

00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:59,510
so usually you need a consultant

00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:01,789
installing a system and so on and we do

00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:04,819
that in combination so we just need like

00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:06,920
for training 10 s AP installations and

00:39:04,819 --> 00:39:12,700
we do that with cloud stack and also

00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:15,920
again with lots of automation behind so

00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:19,910
yeah why do we do that in this private

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:22,520
cloud environment so yeah we put

00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:24,109
together lots of pieces different

00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,910
technologies in the middle as always

00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:29,089
cloud tech so we have all the

00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:30,859
technologies around and that means we

00:39:29,089 --> 00:39:34,220
have the full control on that so we're

00:39:30,859 --> 00:39:37,160
not depending on other body things or

00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:41,869
yeah products changing so that's why we

00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:44,210
have that all together then the SLS are

00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:46,700
important so you can imagine such a few

00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:50,299
systems is quite important for the

00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:52,369
customer and yeah they are not all we

00:39:50,299 --> 00:39:54,650
need clouds ready those applications so

00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:56,599
yeah it's not like just spinning up

00:39:54,650 --> 00:40:00,020
container so it's like huge databases

00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:02,089
and so on that's not so easy - yeah and

00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:06,099
let in a public cloud environment so it

00:40:02,089 --> 00:40:09,349
has some downsides here same as with the

00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:11,269
special use cases that we have you

00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:13,759
thought on the other side before we

00:40:11,269 --> 00:40:16,880
like this sa piano database which

00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:19,039
consumes like terabytes of memory so

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,409
those are also not available on public

00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:27,979
cloud providers with this really huge

00:40:21,409 --> 00:40:30,469
amount of memory so going back to yeah a

00:40:27,979 --> 00:40:37,279
few few years ago when we thought okay

00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:40,369
we need a platform to do to run some

00:40:37,279 --> 00:40:42,559
virtual machines so these are these are

00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:45,109
some of the criterias that we came up

00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:48,589
with why we decided to go for cloud SEC

00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:51,799
so for example the multi-tenancy we

00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:54,140
checked out several systems but you were

00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:57,019
always available there was always

00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:58,849
possible to like run different projects

00:40:57,019 --> 00:41:01,489
and put different permissions on it and

00:40:58,849 --> 00:41:04,189
so on but the problem was that like

00:41:01,489 --> 00:41:07,130
doing all the user stuff and giving

00:41:04,189 --> 00:41:09,679
permissions was all on the administrator

00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:11,229
layer and this was not like shared so in

00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:14,659
cloud so you have the possibility to

00:41:11,229 --> 00:41:17,149
have that all separated and you can

00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:21,859
easily keep that in different customers

00:41:17,149 --> 00:41:24,049
hand of course yeah butI everyone

00:41:21,859 --> 00:41:27,319
support was was one of the key things we

00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:30,109
needed and open source also makes it

00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:31,849
easy to talk to your boss and say okay

00:41:30,109 --> 00:41:37,130
it's open source it doesn't cost

00:41:31,849 --> 00:41:37,759
anything okay coming to my next Monday

00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:41,329
my last slide

00:41:37,759 --> 00:41:46,099
yeah I think it's I just picked up their

00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:48,380
classic works again so so we are running

00:41:46,099 --> 00:41:52,159
classic over four years now so really

00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:56,449
successful so I think that's nothing

00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:58,819
more to say about that here they the

00:41:56,449 --> 00:42:01,039
upgrade past I think this is one of the

00:41:58,819 --> 00:42:03,949
key key things which makes it successful

00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:05,929
we sought with other projects like I

00:42:03,949 --> 00:42:07,699
don't know upstate running or something

00:42:05,929 --> 00:42:10,969
like that so we set up a huge project

00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:13,130
and dependencies between the models and

00:42:10,969 --> 00:42:16,390
so in its outside it's just you just do

00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:20,090
it in it yeah my

00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:20,960
- how to operate it and done in 30

00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:26,300
minutes

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:29,150
easily yes then again so then we have a

00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:32,480
great community on classic and it's yeah

00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:34,910
and sweet and you can take your chance

00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:39,470
and and just just broken up together

00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:53,480
with with others so that's that's about

00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:58,600
it okay our next is Andrea finish from

00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:58,600
data and let me get this on you

00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:26,130
like

00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,280


00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:07,940
yeah

00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:08,960
so yeah my name is Andrea panitch I work

00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:15,010
for here data

00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:17,780
it's a swiss-based cloud company and

00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:19,910
I'll just give a small kind of

00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:22,340
introduction before actually explain a

00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:26,390
few things about cloud stack so here it

00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:28,160
is basically this sound I like to say

00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:30,110
kind of daughter company of the company

00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,540
here there were different kind of

00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:35,450
business bought for last 120 years and

00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:37,940
more the initially the lumber or wood

00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:41,240
industry then as attendance by the multi

00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:44,119
real estates and actually that's quite

00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:47,390
interesting because of the next slide

00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:49,730
during the Sooner State you know of the

00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:51,500
company they basically acquired a huge

00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:54,650
number of physical sites across

00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:59,080
Switzerland and what they attached we

00:44:54,650 --> 00:45:01,340
did is that enable us to at some point

00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:03,590
build our huge

00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:06,410
fiber-optic network which is usually

00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:10,040
privately owned but here so this is not

00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:12,200
least from our let's say public telecom

00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:15,950
companies it's really ownership over

00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:19,060
here it's 100% private stuff with

00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:25,820
certain Escalades guaranteed latency

00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:29,290
with over 99.99 times 100 gigabits in a

00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:33,560
backbone network and of course we are

00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:36,470
simply let's say certified according to

00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:37,820
some of the regulations including the

00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:39,560
femur which is very interesting tonight

00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:42,200
for financial institutions which needs

00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:46,369
to actually move their workers to the

00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:47,960
cloud and that's pretty much it we have

00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:49,990
us some kind of remote connections from

00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:53,150
sort of rock salt and some other

00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:55,520
locations where actually I really

00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:57,590
explaining are other sites now the

00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,420
reason we chose tech I believe

00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:01,870
the previous two companies explained

00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:04,670
very well I didn't particularly prepare

00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:06,800
for this kind of presenting during the

00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:08,990
Skinner box I will just basically

00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,670
explain whether they steal the nice

00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:13,040
bullet points which was really true it

00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:15,860
really works it's easy to set up it's

00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,660
easy to operate I know a great guy who

00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:20,120
is actually called to started consulting

00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:23,900
for some older German company who told

00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:27,260
me that old all the OpenStack project

00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:29,260
that he's aware of in the last couple of

00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:31,610
years they are still implementing state

00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:40,340
something similar probably as Mike

00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:41,810
explained by the way year 2019 basically

00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:43,820
you know that's the fact because the

00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:45,830
very close the open stake is that the

00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:48,320
texture you need to point many pieces

00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:50,900
together it's really hard and thought

00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:53,150
that is very I would say integrated the

00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:55,370
the biggest challenges actually and

00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:57,110
that's not huge charges just to make it

00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:58,940
full it doesn't contain a sense of

00:46:57,110 --> 00:47:00,950
fairness service or balancing stuff of

00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:03,020
nothing special that you came undone

00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:06,200
maybe with any kind of other web

00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:12,790
application would say so basically we

00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:18,050
started with cloud stack December 2012

00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:20,690
we are not speak I would say committers

00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:23,750
and maybe not so that we are not going

00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:26,420
to rethink it that much to the product

00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:29,900
itself in certain in comparison to some

00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:32,870
other guys but we are obviously a heavy

00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:34,370
consumer and we did almost a few stuff

00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:38,240
will be to commit a few stuff that were

00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:41,720
maybe interesting so basically we are

00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:43,550
public public cloud provider and the

00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:46,190
focus is obviously on privacy and

00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:48,140
everything else the switz on laws and

00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:51,700
obviously the technical things for right

00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:54,680
within the cloud stack as well and

00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:56,900
basically I'm not sure if I should

00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,959
continue explaining why which was all

00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,459
stable that's all

00:47:57,959 --> 00:48:04,839
in my presentation tomorrow you will

00:48:00,459 --> 00:48:06,219
actually be able to see I would say for

00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:08,949
my point of view pretty interesting

00:48:06,219 --> 00:48:10,690
story of the experience moving up how we

00:48:08,949 --> 00:48:12,819
grew us for years or challenges we kept

00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:15,849
our resolving and so on so it's very

00:48:12,819 --> 00:48:19,809
hopefully very interesting one now

00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:21,849
beside beside the cloud stack we do

00:48:19,809 --> 00:48:25,479
offer a couple of different services for

00:48:21,849 --> 00:48:27,999
customers so basically on the left you

00:48:25,479 --> 00:48:29,979
see that we have a the other previously

00:48:27,999 --> 00:48:32,380
explained by rock networks well we call

00:48:29,979 --> 00:48:34,869
Switzerland we are enabling customer

00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:36,819
sites with integrations so basically we

00:48:34,869 --> 00:48:38,589
are connecting with no premises or

00:48:36,819 --> 00:48:40,539
private network with our private met for

00:48:38,589 --> 00:48:42,640
customers reach the cloud and then

00:48:40,539 --> 00:48:44,859
inside the let's say cloud or the data

00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:47,319
centers we are very soon actually going

00:48:44,859 --> 00:48:48,999
to launch the container world believe

00:48:47,319 --> 00:48:52,349
beginning over the next year we already

00:48:48,999 --> 00:48:55,509
do offer h3 compatible lots of storage

00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:58,170
which is there's no certain solution but

00:48:55,509 --> 00:49:00,690
it's fully why I would say 99.9%

00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:04,059
compatible on the protocol levels so

00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:05,319
based on delivery formulas and stuff we

00:49:04,059 --> 00:49:07,839
do also operate some other

00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:09,940
letsa cloud solutions based on a dual

00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:12,880
stack then also our custom-built cloud

00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:14,410
for 0 I suppose internally and also what

00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,809
what might be interesting for some

00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:19,539
customers is that we are about I believe

00:49:16,809 --> 00:49:21,190
in October if I'm not mistaken we're

00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:24,400
about to launch our divert direct

00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:27,099
private peering connections to Microsoft

00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,900
Azure and office 365 so basically

00:49:27,099 --> 00:49:33,369
customers will come through our private

00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:36,539
network through through the core of the

00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:39,910
network and then up to the big up

00:49:36,539 --> 00:49:42,999
private virtual connections basically to

00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:45,190
the Microsoft data centers in Amsterdam

00:49:42,999 --> 00:49:48,489
and I believe this one up in Amsterdam

00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:50,890
so basically we are able to to offer a

00:49:48,489 --> 00:49:54,699
guaranteed latency from customer

00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:56,709
locations we are proud we are optical

00:49:54,699 --> 00:49:59,619
network up to the public cloud providers

00:49:56,709 --> 00:50:02,270
which is which I just mentioned and this

00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:05,060
my believe it's

00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:06,680
as far as I was told we are basically

00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:09,230
the only provider if he has this kind of

00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:11,270
connection to - at the moment Microsoft

00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:16,599
services but I believe the other public

00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:16,599
vendors will come soon as well Microsoft

00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:24,380
that I mentioned them so much anyway so

00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:29,690
Mike I use on 360

00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:31,849
not enough for or maybe enough but

00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:33,770
anyway if you're interested more in in

00:50:31,849 --> 00:50:36,950
the clouds text or in our experience

00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:38,810
which is not everybody sharing the dirty

00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:41,119
laundry in sense of a bad experience

00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:43,670
with certain issues and how we solve

00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:46,310
them something is wrong from our side

00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:51,200
some things help improve will join me

00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:54,760
tomorrow at 11:04 in this moment there

00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,760

[Applause]

00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,719

this up so anyways yeah I mean basically

00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:28,450
I can kind of get in the point across

00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:30,280
here that we've just got a great

00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:33,130

00:51:38,859 --> 00:51:42,869
working with each other whether it's at

00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:46,180
the hackathon or in between

00:51:42,869 --> 00:51:49,180
presentations just get to know each

00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:51,940
