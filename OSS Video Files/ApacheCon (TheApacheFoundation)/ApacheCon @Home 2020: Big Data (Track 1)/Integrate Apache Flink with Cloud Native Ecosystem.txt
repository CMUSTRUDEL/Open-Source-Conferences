With the vigorous development of cloud-native and serverless computing, there are more and more big-data workloads, especially Apache Flink workloads, running in Alibaba cloud for better deployment and management, backed by Kubernetes. This presentation introduces the experiences of intergrating Flink with cloud-native ecosystem, including the improvements in Flink to support elasticity and natively running on Kubernetes, the experiences about managing dependent components like ZooKeeper, HDFS etc. and leveraging Kubernetes service/network/storage extensions, better supports for big-data workloads to satisfy requirements on multi-tanent management, resource fairness, resource elasticity etc. and achieve high scheduling performance via Apache YuniKorn.
