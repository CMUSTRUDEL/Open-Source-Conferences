In the analysis of big data there are often problem queries that don’t scale because they require huge compute resources to generate exact results, or don’t parallelize well. Examples include count-distinct, quantiles, most frequent items, joins, matrix computations, and graph analysis. Algorithms that can produce accuracy guaranteed approximate answers for these problem queries are a required toolkit for modern analysis systems that need to process massive amounts of data quickly. For interactive queries there may not be other viable alternatives, and in the case of real­-time streams, these specialized algorithms, called stochastic, streaming, sublinear algorithms, or 'sketches', are the only known solution. This technology has helped Yahoo successfully reduce data processing times from days to hours or minutes on a number of its internal platforms and has enabled subsecond queries on real-time platforms that would have been infeasible without sketches. This talk provides an introduction to sketching and to Apache DataSketches, an open source library in C++, Java and Python of algorithms designed for large production analysis systems.

Lee Rhodes is a Distinguished Architect at Yahoo (now Verizon Media). He created the DataSketches project in 2012 to address analysis problems in Yahoo's large data processing pipelines. DataSketches was Open Sourced in 2015 and is in incubation at Apache Software Foundation. He was an author or coauthor on sketching work published in ICDT, IMC, and JCGS. He obtained his Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University.
