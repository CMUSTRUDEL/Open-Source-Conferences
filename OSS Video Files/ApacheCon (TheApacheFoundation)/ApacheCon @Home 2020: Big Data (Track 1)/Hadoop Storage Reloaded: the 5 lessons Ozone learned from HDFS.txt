	Hadoop Storage Reloaded: the 5 lessons Ozone learned from HDFS
MÃ¡rton Elek

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

Apache (Hadoop) Ozone is a brand-new storage system for the Hadoop ecosystem. It provides Object Store semantics (like S3) and can handle billions of objects. Ozone doesn't depend on HDFS but it's the "spiritual successor" of it. The lessons learned during the 10+ years of HDFS helped to design a more scalable object store. This presentation explains the key challenges of a storage system and shows how the specific problems can be answered.

Marton Elek is PMC in Apache Hadoop and Apache Ratis projects and working on the Apache Hadoop Ozone at Cloudera. Ozone is a new Hadoop sub-project which provides an S3 compatible Object Store for Hadoop on top of a new generalized binary storage layer. He is also working on the containerization of Hadoop and creating different solutions to run Apache Big Data projects in Kubernetes and other could native environments.
