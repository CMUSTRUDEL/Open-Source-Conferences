Apache Iceberg is a table format that allows data engineers and data scientists to build reliable and efficient data lakes with features that are normally present only in data warehouses. This talk will be a deep dive into key design principles of Apache Iceberg that enable the following features on top of data lakes: - ACID compliance on top of any object store or distributed file system - Flexible indexing capabilities which boost the performance of highly selective queries - Implicit partitioning using partition transforms - Reliable schema evolution - Time travel and rollback These advanced features let companies substantially simplify their current architectures as well as enable new use cases on top of data lakes.

Anton is a committer and PMC member of Apache Iceberg as well as an Apache Spark contributor at Apple. At Apple, he is working on making data lakes efficient and reliable. Prior to joining Apple, he optimized and extended a proprietary Spark distribution at SAP. Anton holds a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from RWTH Aachen University.
Vishwanath Lakkundi is the engineering lead for the team that focuses on Data Orchestration and Data Lake at Apple. This team is responsible for development of an elastic fully managed Apache Spark as a service, a Data Lake engine based on Apache Iceberg and a data pipelines product based on Apache Airflow. He has been working with Apple since the last seven years focusing on various analytics infrastructure and platform products.
