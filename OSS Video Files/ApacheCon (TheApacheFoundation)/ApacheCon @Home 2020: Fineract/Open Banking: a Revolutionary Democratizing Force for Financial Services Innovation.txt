working at updraft where we are taking

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,840
advantage

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,560
of open banking to bring new consumer

um to people in the uk and uh with

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,760
the big advantage of being uh in set in

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,519
the uk

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,959
the kind of where open banking was

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,440
created where

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,799
you know a few you know a bit ahead of

about 300 kilometers from nairobi

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,439
lakeside

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,439

founder and ceo of um fintech standup

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,000
called tripode

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,439
that's one of the things that keeps me

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,360
busy these days

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:17,759
now teapotty is certainly for wallet

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,759
and specifically a woman's wallet

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:24,000
because we really feel that this

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,880
is an area of um

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,520
a lot of work that needs to be done you

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,400
know

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,800
helping women entrepreneurs across

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,919
africa especially in the

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,479
what uh in kenya we call the sarco

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,720
sector

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:43,840
uh in the u.s and not in

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,600
north america you you would probably

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,600
uh call them um

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,160
credit credit unions i think

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,960
yeah that's correct yeah so basically

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,520
depochy

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:07,120
is working closely with

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,520
me force to create what we call a

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,120
digital banking ecosystem

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,600
we want to provide world-class

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,560
not just co-banking but an omnichannel

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,840
platform

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:23,280
for the lowest

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:27,360
tire financial institutions

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:30,800
from microfinance to groups

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,199
you know to put them to the fourth

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,880
maybe fifth higher microfinance

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,720
institutions and banks

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,520
what we want to do is bring

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,160
world-class digital banking to the

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,000
masses

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,800
across africa and that's one of the

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,919
things i do

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,280
and of course ed has talked about

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:57,840
my work with him with me first

00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:01,560
i really believe and firmly

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,840
think that mayforce is really one of the

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,199
democratizing aspects of financial

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,199
services across this region and

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,560
potentially across our

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,160
across the world so that's just a bit

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,400
about myself okay

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,160
good thank you everyone yeah and just

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,560
briefly introduce myself i think

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,080
most folks on our panel know me but my

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,479
name is ed cable and i'm the

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,000
president ceo of the meet folks

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,479

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,400
pleasure

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,199
you know working with many companies

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,039
like the panama paul today

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,199
who have been in building out solutions

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,520
on top of the finra apis

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,919
so to get the discussion started today

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,160
you know i just wanted to really help

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,600
inform everybody on the origins of open

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,639
banking and what really

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,120
you know open banking means and so since

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,520
we've got

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,960
matt who's from you know london and uk

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,000
really the birthplace of the open

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,160
banking

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,160
movement i wanted him to you know help

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,840
define what open banking is

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,160
what it doesn't entail and really why

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:05,759
was there the need for open banking

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,240
yeah so i open banking

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,360
is is i think to kind of help understand

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,440
why it's there

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,199
is it's quite useful just go back to

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,319
kind of a little bit of the history of

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,599
what led to its creation so the open

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,639
banking

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,440
is actually a response uh to roll back a

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,000
few years

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,599
there was a competition commission in

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,800
the uk investigation

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:31,919
into the high street banks

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,639
and basically the the summary conclusion

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,520
of that

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,840
was that they weren't offering um

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,880
sufficient amount of consumer choice

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,360
um and so something should be done

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,560
um in order to improve consumer choice

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,840
and in what was

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,360
a pretty forward-looking um

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,919
sort of decision as sort of an

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,120
intervention um the decision was made

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:58,400
to require the banks to open up

00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,440
via apis and that really led to

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,000
the open banking initiative so in the uk

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,440
the open banking organization um is

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,560
actually funded

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:13,520
by basically fines that are being levied

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:16,160
on the big the main high street banks

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,840
and they are they are required to open

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,479
up and provide access

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,680
to their services via the open banking

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,840
apis

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,879
specifically in in order to increase

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,960
consumer choice

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,479
um and so that's really the the

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,599
motivation

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,599
of this was to increase consumer choice

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,919
and you know quite forward-looking say

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,560
you know how do we use apis to do that

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,039
so that led to the creation and has now

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,279
led

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,479
to the ecosystem that is kind of

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,680
starting and growing

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,320
um in the uk of companies

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,279
doing exactly that providing more choice

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,279
to consumers

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,839
and more ways that they can access

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:57,760
different sorts of services

00:08:53,839 --> 00:09:00,320
via open banking apis and so i think

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,800
in in the uk we're sort of lucky in that

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,200
we're

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:08,640
ahead in that most of our banks provide

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,920
open banking apis we have a growing

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,440
ecosystem

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,519
um around uh you know that

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,480
and we're getting a growing amount of

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,040
innovation

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,959
um sort of new businesses coming up with

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,480
new and interesting solutions that build

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,279
on top of those apis

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,160
and really open those up to consumers

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,680
and i think we're

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,240
just at the very start right now

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,600
at the point we'll start to see what do

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,200
consumers adopt

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,720
because that to me is kind of really the

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,720
interesting question is

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,920
what really are the solutions that are

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,200
going to land

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,959
with consumers and what are the things

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,920
they're going to go to scale with

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,880
consumers

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,640
well thanks matt we're going to

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,360
definitely touch on the consumer facing

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,519
perspective

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,440
in just a bit but wanted to you know

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,760
have victor comment on the

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,880
regulatory and competitive climate in

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,480
mexico and

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,480
i know that you know there in mexico

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,959
they've also adopted the same

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,800
uk open banking standards so were there

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:06,079
similar drivers for the

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,120
need for open banking down there yes

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,320
here in mexico

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:13,600
our regulatory institutions request

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,200
to have the standards in order to secure

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,240
the information

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:22,560
to provide access access to

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:26,560
the apis with the privilege that the

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:29,600
institution or tea party requires only

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,959
also the customers must have the data

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,760
secured

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,480
and of course it must be a balance

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,560
between the

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,600
innovation and between the the

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,480
connectivity because

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,600
in the past years the fintechs

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,640
institutions

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,920
start to grow up

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:53,040
in in the in the number in mexico

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,880
so then the the kind of connections the

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,399
need of

00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,839
interchange information uh

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:05,120
cause or was a need for having this

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:08,959
fintech law this is important because

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:12,320
also the protocols for example https

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:15,760
now is part of this fintech law

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:19,279
and also the technology companies

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:22,240
are looking for new ways to innovate

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,200
based on technology of course because it

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,320
reduce

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,440
the total cost of ownership of

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:34,000
any financial solution and

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,000
on the other side they need mass

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,680
massive solutions for for reaching

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,600
uh

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,040
large population

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,320
okay thanks victor and we'll definitely

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,000
come back to some of those you know

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,399
aspects around security

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
but i wanted uh ali just to you know

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,240
comment on the situation in

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,760
africa because i know as a whole you

00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,360
know there's only a couple countries

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,600
that are starting to

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,880
adopt open banking so you know why do

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,000
you think there is this

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,680
slowness to adopting it ali so

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,959
so first let me talk about my home

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:14,480
country kenya

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:19,200
and kenya is a very interesting

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:23,279
case where regulation

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:26,399
and policy hasn't really kept up with

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,519
the new open banking thinking and i

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,920
think

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,720
that's that has mainly been because of

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,000
this of

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,639
our success with mobile money so that

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,639
has

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:42,320
been sort of um

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,320
almost like we don't need it

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,920
to some accident because mobile money

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,639
has become so perversive

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,639
in kenya that

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,680
the biggest player now that is safari

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:59,040
comes and pesa

00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:02,079
has become so dominant that it's

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:05,120
now 98 market share

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,360
for mobile money in kenya and then

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,639
what you then have is that you have

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,480
banks

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:16,639
that come almost completely depend

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:20,399
on m-pesa for their mobile strategy

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:23,600
so there has been a de facto

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:27,600
sharing of information

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:30,480
but anchored on mobile money

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,480
so for example

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:38,240
i can i can send money from

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:42,000
any bank account using my mobile phone

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:47,440
into uh you know

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:51,040
from my from my mobile banking app

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:55,199
directly to a mobile phone uh i can

00:13:51,040 --> 00:14:00,000
send from m-pesa directly to my mobile

00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:03,839
to my to my to my bank account or to

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,880
any other bank account so

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:10,240
that sort of de facto

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:13,839
uh you know ecosystem has

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:18,240
created this notion that

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:20,800
it's not an agency yet it is

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,600
we need to move beyond i mean we can see

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,160
already

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,079
the dominance of one player i mean it's

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,639
reached a point where there's no bank

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,079
today

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:33,360
in kenya that can actually have any

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:37,279
viable mobile strategy without

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:42,800
a peso which creates a really

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:45,680
interesting situation here

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,440
but when you then look at the fintech

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,360
environment

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,360
the unfortunate truth is that

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:57,839
we have a policy and

00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,000
atmosphere in this country that is not

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,040
necessarily conducive to the growth of

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,959
internet

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,880
and we hope to change that with the

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,000
right interventions and the right

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:12,160
composition with the right people

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:16,000
so then let's look at africa

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:19,199
as a whole honestly only nigeria

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,320
has made strikes uh with

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,959
an open banking efforts

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,160
and i think that is moving in the right

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,079
direction

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,199
and most african countries need to sort

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,800
of uh

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:36,160
take protect the lessons

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,639
of of where nigeria is going

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,759
and of course take the lessons from the

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:45,680
uk especially

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:48,160
really spoken pretty well about

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,199
about how that has happened my humble

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,399
belief is that

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:55,600
open binding can never happen

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:58,720
holistically without all the players

00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:02,320
in the space regulators

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,959
policy makers fintechs the high street

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,279
banks

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,880
the microfinance institutions coming

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,120
together

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,040
and i think there's a slow movement uh

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,160
to be able to achieve that

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:17,120
uh in africa we have the

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,000
africa free trade agreement which came

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,519
into

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,040
being operational in the last few weeks

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:27,120
and we are hoping that

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,480
agreement will open up the financial

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,160
services

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,519
space well thank you ali and we're

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,920
definitely going to come back to

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,079
some of the specific issues and

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,399
challenges and opportunities in africa

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,320
but before we go there just wanted to

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,759
you know return back to what matt said

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,759
around some of those you know

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,720
interesting use cases from the consumer

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,800
perspective

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,720
so i think you know often we get caught

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,399
up thinking about just the apis or the

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,079
standards and it's hard to

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,600
really you know adopt the mindset of

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,480
what open banking means from the

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,480
consumer

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,240
which is who's really intended to

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,079
benefit from these regulations and

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,519
emerging standards so

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,360
could you speak to you know how the

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,079
consumer can benefit matt and what are

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,880
some of the most

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:11,360
interesting use cases you've seen from

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,360
the uk

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,000
so so uh is is i actually i'll touch

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,360
briefly on sort of what what updraft do

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,039
because um obviously

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,079
i'm cto it's because that's they're the

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,120
ones that i think are the most

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,240
interesting

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,319
case so what we do is we

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,679
um we basically work to help people get

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,880
people out of debt

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,760
um and we're primarily focused

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,559
on in the uk the expensive debt that

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,600
people carry

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:42,640
which is um high street bank overdrafts

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:45,760
um and high street you know credit cards

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,799
um so those are debts that kind of

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,240
people build up

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,240
um as they kind of start in their

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,160
careers they get to a point and suddenly

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,400
there is they're carrying maybe

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,000
10 15 000 pounds of unsecured debt at

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,280
high rates of interest

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,039
um and so we really work uh with them to

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,080
actually help them manage that get out

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,440
of debt and get to the point where

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,960
they're kind of saving and paying down

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,679
that debt so it's costing them a lot

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,799
less

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:11,679
and um the two things we do with that

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,200
is we use open banking to get the same

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,799
sort of insight that previously would

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,280
have been locked information within a

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,960
bank

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,480
in terms of what's their spending what's

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,039
their transactions and we use that as

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,120
part

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:25,280
of our credit and underwriting process

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,320
um and then we will actually write them

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,840
uh you know

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,400
loans at lower cost than they're

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,720
currently paying um so instead of paying

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,320
minimum payments on credit cards or not

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,320
paying anything off their overdraft

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,440
they're then on a kind of term loan plan

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,039
in order to actually

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,720
you know reduce their debt and i think

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,320
so from our perspective we've been able

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,919
to do something that

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,360
previously would have been kind of

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,880
locked inside the banks

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,400
right because only the banks have enough

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,160
information to kind of make

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,760
those rapid decisions with the kind of

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,480
the depth you know and make it a really

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,240
simple

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,440
sort of process um but i think there's

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,520
as we've kind of worked with other

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,720
people around open banking there's a

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,320
couple of other

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,480
sort of interesting cases that i think

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,960
are worth highlighting that are

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,520
cases that i think would never have been

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,280
um

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,880
enabled had it not been for some

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,600
openness for apis

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,240
so there's a couple of um companies that

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,200
we know

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,160
that are both working in the area of

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,320
helping

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,600
um vulnerable people and kind of older

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,080
people

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,840
manage their money and avoid cases of

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,400
kind of financial fraud

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,919
and so on so they're using open banking

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,919
apis to get insight into the

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,320
transactions that are going on

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,559
and to allow those people to start to

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,039
delegate a level of kind of

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,600
authority to other people but maybe

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,520
without

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,960
not going kind of the the previous sort

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,919
of route which kind of legal power of

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,760
attorneys and things

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,919
would have to delegate all so it

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,240
provides some kind of graduation away

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,760
you can go and those are solutions that

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,360
require access to

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,039
confidential and kind of you know the

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,039
financial information there

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,360
but with a level of kind of control and

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,880
access that requires a granularity that

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,080
wouldn't have been able to be

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,000
enabled without open banking apis

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,600
and and i think you think about sort of

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,880
apis and new technologies and

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,880
smartphones

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,400
you don't immediately go to well who are

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,120
going to be the users of this

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,960
well that's going to be you know people

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,080
you know maybe with early onset dementia

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,159
[Music]

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,080
who maybe aren't using it directly but

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,240
they're getting a benefit from it

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,679
um from there so i think it's quite

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,600
interesting to see some of the most

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,720
innovative solutions that have come out

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,120
addressing underserved niche markets you

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,360
know

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,880
leveraging technology not necessarily by

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,840
going direct to the consumer

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,640
with the technology thanks i definitely

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,480
wasn't aware

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,799
of some of those those use cases and

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,679
before we move on to victor just how

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,880
how have the banks in the uk responded

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,559
you know now that they've

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,640
been mandated to provide these open

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,320
banking apis and there is more

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,960
competition from fintechs what's been

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,960
their response

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:05,120
um so

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,120
i wouldn't say they're keen um

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,799
there's definitely an element of

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,440
probably a little bit more stick than

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,880
carrots

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,640
um for the banks um that they've

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,480
you know they have engaged with it so

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,880
they haven't dragged their heels

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,760
um but you can see from their

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,159
perspective

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,760
it it's hard to justify kind of why it

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,039
should be the most important

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,640
um thing and there's certainly you know

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,480
across the range of banks that sort of

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,520
we look at you get a range

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,600
of a different depth of engagement some

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,120
are being very forward-looking kind of

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,240
leaning into it and kind of looking and

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,600
seeing what they can do

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,720
and others are leaning back

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,799
whether from kind of a reluctance all to

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,320
be honest i think in some cases

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:53,440
a you know internal challenges in that

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,559
their existing systems they have their

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,919
own problems internally with their

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,240
existing systems and then

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,240
adding an api layer onto that just

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,360
really highlights that and exacerbates

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,559
the problems of their internal

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,320
infrastructure and so

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,159
they have a lot of investment and work

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,919
to do just to get on top of their

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:11,039
infrastructure full stop

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,159
and layering sort of open banking and

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,400
sort of you know api

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,840
access and fintechs that kind of want to

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,000
innovate on top of that

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,039
just you know highlights the problems

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,240
that they have

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,039
um yeah in in general yeah we're we're

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,520
well served

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,880
it it's it's unusual for us to have

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,880
customers come to us

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,559
and they can't connect their banks you

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,400
know that's very much the exception

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,840
case um we do get issues where

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,919
you know we have downtime and kind of

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,720
things don't work but by the most part

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,880
it it's

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,080
you know if consumers motivate and want

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,000
to do it um

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,760
they have a pretty good time of things

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,679
nowadays most consumers can

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,280
quite comfortably use open banking

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,559
without really having to worry about any

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,840
of the technology it's just pretty

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,280
seamless and works

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,880
yeah and we're going to touch on when we

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,360
speak about the road map you know how we

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,320
can

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,760
enable both the publishing of open

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,760
banking apis from the financial

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,360
institution perspective but also

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,679
you know how fintechs can more readily

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,600
consume them victor from the

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,000
perspective of mexico what are some of

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,559
the novel use cases you've seen

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,960
at the moment there for example here in

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:18,480
mexico

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:21,760
they have published the open

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:25,200
open banking apis for

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:28,880
saving accounts level 2 most of them

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:31,360
so then the people can use

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,080
or the developers can use these apis in

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,400
order to

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,000
integrate with the wallet with the

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,360
mobile application or with

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,760
the web page that they have implemented

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,000
in the

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,400
fintech solution that they have on the

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,840
other hand also the loans

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:51,200
the loans requires the the need

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:54,880
for having a proper

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:58,159
anti-money laundry policies and

00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:01,360
of course this is provided by apis

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:04,159
and and also the kyc so

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,960
so then for the loans this has been a

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,520
revolution

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,520
talking about the integration in all the

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:17,679
banking ecosystems because the need

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,039
of integrating a lot of system now is

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,559
more easy

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:26,000
but for example there is one use case

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:29,120
right now where the bank is

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,640
publishing the apis there is a mobile

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:35,039
application

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:38,000
the final user or the

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:40,640
customer using the mobile application

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,159
can create a payment order

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:47,120
and then later it can go to the

00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,039
merchant for example warmer and do the

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,880
withdrawal of the money

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:56,159
this is a use case that applies

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:59,520
for location that don't have access to

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:02,559
an atm or a branch

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,640
of the bank thank you victor

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,400
and then ali my question regarding this

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,120
will be a little bit different for you

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,880
so i know you know given the it's pretty

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,320
nascent in terms of open banking

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,720
standards emerging

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,240
across sub-saharan africa like one

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,480
question you know i wanted to explore

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,320
with you was you know is there almost a

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,600
converse you know driver impetus for

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,600
open banking

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,919
in africa given you know the high number

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,600
of informal institutions who

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,760
you know would benefit from being able

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,440
to open up their data so it's not that

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,440
they have a monopoly on their data

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,919
but they have this treasured data that

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,440
could be valuable to fintechs could then

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,480
offer services do you see that as an

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,480
opportunity and

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,919
how do you think open banking could help

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,840
you know transform some of these

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:48,080
informal sector institutions

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:51,039
so you know i think

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,679
the opportunity is just so immense from

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,039
um

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:58,320
from a pan-african perspective again

00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:02,799
if we start with my home country africa

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:06,240
uh kenya the kenya bankers association

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:09,440
has organization called

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:13,279
ipsl that stands for integrated

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:17,279
payment services limited and ipsl

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:19,600
has a anchor product called peso link

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,520
so personal is so really for money and

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,279
of course link

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:29,840
and pencil link has already shown in its

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:31,200
smaller way how important open banking

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,120
can be

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:38,720
because personally that sort of

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:41,840
has connected all the times

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:46,000
so before presser link

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:49,760
we used to use swift and rtgs

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,760
and that would take maybe

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:58,000
a few hours for hours yes i probably

00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:01,840
24 48 hours for

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:06,480
swift and that's within the same country

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:09,600
and if you make that transaction

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:13,039
say on a friday afternoon for

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,919
rtgs or or sales then you probably have

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,919
to wait

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:20,159
to wait until until monday

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,520
it's almost like the computers sleep

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,320
over the weekend

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,320
and they don't work

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:31,200
but with pestling

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:34,320
you can make a transaction on a sunday

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,600
afternoon and the transaction

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,600
is instantaneous

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,559
so you you can already start seeing the

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:45,919
opportunities

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:49,840
uh with collaboration

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:53,200
between banks and now with

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:56,399
trying bringing on board

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,200
the other financial services players

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,919
like fintechs and micro

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,720
microfinance institutions that are not

00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,559
necessarily

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,360
are not members of the kenya packers

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,919
association so we we can already start

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,120
seeing an

00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:14,880
expansion of the use case

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:18,240
for pestling now this is without

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:22,559
any regulatory or policy intervention

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:25,840
now imagine if we walked along together

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:28,840
with policymakers and regulators so

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,159
obviously kenya has its national payment

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:35,600
system

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,600
that was enacted back in the mid

00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,640
2010s

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:47,600
but my humble opinion is that

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,600
you know that act needs to be brought

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:54,320
to the future so that you can

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,840
start encompassing other players that

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,840
are not necessarily

00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,120
high street banks i like that term at

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,880
high street banks

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:07,440
that's something that we really need

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:11,600
to look at and there was an attempt

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:15,600
sometime last year where

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:18,320
the fst the financial sector depending

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,320
uh program

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,960
worked together with players in the in

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,880
the industry

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,080
to create the payments association of

00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,039
kenya

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:34,080
but unfortunately at some point that

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:37,200
whole initiative got steamed

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,960
um what we are doing

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:44,080
in kenya like a lot of other

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:48,320
african countries that now reforming

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:51,279
the kenya fintech association

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,480
now we should have been informed by now

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,200
but unfortunately

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,919
it happened and you know things just

00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,559
slowed down

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,279
tremendously government services only

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,120
became

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,960
essential services so we're really

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,799
hoping that at some point

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,960
before the end of the year we will have

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,279
our fintech association our programming

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,760
like

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,720
other african countries so that we can

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,399
really start

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:19,600
engaging meaningfully with other players

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:21,520
in the financial services sector yeah

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,000
thanks ali for touching on a few of the

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,039
specific

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,960
aspects of the api itself and maybe matt

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,240
you could and i know we're getting close

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,720
towards the end of our session we have

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,279
about

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,799
five minutes plus left but i wanted to

00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,720
make sure we covered some of the aspects

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,240
of the implications for the roadmap

00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,679
before we do that matt maybe you could

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,720
talk a little bit about you know what

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,200
the actual

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,799
ap apis are that are available through

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,960
the open banking standard

00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,240
and how your app actually connects to

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,000
them and consumes them

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,840
and maybe also touch on how finrac is

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,840
involved as well

00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:07,679
so matt were you able to hear me

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,640
did i lose everybody there or yeah now

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:13,039
you're back matt

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:16,000
yeah um yeah so from from an open

00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,640
perspective um we've sort of really

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,760
looked at it

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,880
there's sort of there's two two sorts of

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,720
apis there's

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,720
you've got the data apis where you're

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,760
kind of reading data that's kind of been

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,760
previously locked

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,360
in financial institutions and then

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,799
essentially you've got the right apis

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,880
that are to do with kind of

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,320
transaction authorization actually kind

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,840
of moving money

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:39,120
um around um both of those

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,039
you know are interesting kind of have

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,760
different use cases and often both the

00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,399
two come

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,200
together um one of the things that we

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,679
found

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,399
is we did quite a lot of work with the

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,720
data

00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:52,640
apis in terms of analyzing transactions

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,880
and looking at transactions

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,360
one of the things that we've found is

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,039
there's a whole set of kind of

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,480
detail and granularity that sits

00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:03,600
underneath that in terms of

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,320
the range of quality um what you get

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,360
um through those uh right down to things

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,919
that you would think would be pretty

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,519
simple

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,120
like what's the timestamp on a

00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,760
transaction

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,679
um you know clearly a transaction

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,320
happened at a point in time

00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,360
um in the country as that flows through

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,240
the banking system

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:24,000
we often find that um we have consumers

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,080
that do all of their transactions

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,159
and in exactly the same minute every

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,399
single day and that minute is midnight

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,159
um so it's somewhere the kind of the

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:35,039
timestamps being lost and that

00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,399
sort of loss of information then loses a

00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,720
set of things that you could be able to

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,559
do

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,320
so say you were tracking somebody's

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,919
location and you wanted to match

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,000
the transactions with the locations they

00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,679
were in well because that granularity of

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,559
the timestamps has been stripped off

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,559
you're no longer able to do that um so i

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,159
think when you go underneath the apis

00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:53,200
and start look at kind of the data

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,640
what's there

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,640
how's the data formatted how

00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,200
descriptions formatted and how to

00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,440
different

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,279
banks even within the uk how do

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,240
different banks

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,440
format that data let alone going outside

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,960
of just a single

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,559
country you start to go to other

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,279
countries and look at

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:13,279
how's the metadata vary around things i

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,399
think there's a huge amount of work that

00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,720
needs to be done

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,440
to enable people yeah they've got api

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,480
connections

00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,880
they're going to start to be kind of

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,720
getting data through that what does the

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,159
data look like right what do example

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,200
data sets look like how do different

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,880
banks use it

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,640
how can they improve how can they grow

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,640
consistently and then how can you build

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,559
a solution that works in one country

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,080
that starts to enable it to go across

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,440
multiple countries so i think there's

00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,080
some kind of big gaps

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,600
there that come once we've got the apis

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,480
there's still a lot more work that needs

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,559
to be done

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,399
in terms of you know standardizing

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,120
making available and really enabling

00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:48,399
people to

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,760
you know take advantage of that

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,360
well thanks matt yeah and let me touch a

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,240
little bit on you know what currently

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,480
has sort of been

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,679
implemented thus far in the finrac

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,679
community around

00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,840
open banking and then i'll you know just

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,760
get some more additional feedback on

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,080
how we can broaden that but i know

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,919
michael has been asking some questions

00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,279
so some of these efforts you know we're

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,960
trying to coordinate through

00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,560
a working group of volunteers and

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,159
partners across the community

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,159
so i think the link's on the mailing

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,839
list but we welcome everybody to join

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,679
our open banking working group to

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,200
discuss you know some of the

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,599
various api gateways that have been

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,639
utilized you know which apis to publish

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,040
and consume

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,480
etc but the efforts we've advanced thus

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,200
far have tried to focus you know a

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,159
couple fronts

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,000
first off more on like the supply side

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,839
you know making sure

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,599
the financial institutions that are you

00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,800
know following an open banking standard

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,560
are able to easily

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,560
you know provide these apis so we're

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,000
trying to work and follow the uk

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,760
open banking standard and make it

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,159
possible such that if you're using

00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,240
finrack or mephos you're able to easily

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,240
publish a set of open banking apis to

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,320
allow third parties as matt said to

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,720
either access information or initiate

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,359
transactions and do these right apis on

00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,599
their behalf

00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,599
so we've you know done a proof of

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,960
concept with a number of different apis

00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,640
and those are available

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,960
in a repository but we're looking you

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,880
know to work with the community to have

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,560
more of the apis for our first party

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,079
applications to be mapped to the open

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,359
banking standards

00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,200
and then the second front you know we're

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,520
trying to help drive innovation

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,440
is providing a reference you know open

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,720
banking app sdk

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,160
which provides some of the common

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,040
functionalities you would need in a

00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,040
mobile app

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,119
and then allows one to easily connect to

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,079
the various open banking and apis to

00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,400
demonstrate

00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,680
and focus on the specific use cases

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,760
enabled by the

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,240
apis and then the last front is more

00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,920
around having a lab environment to test

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,760
out you know both the development of

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,880
apps for these apis and also consuming

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,040
them from the

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,960
core banking side and matt you touched

00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,720
on you know how having access to these

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,000
common data sets would be

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,400
you know a gap that could help

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,440
accelerate the adoption of open banking

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,640
apis

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,640
like from the perspective of our

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,359
panelists what you know do you think the

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,520
finrac community could focus on to help

00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:59,040
the open banking movement accelerate and

00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,920
also how can open banking help

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,359
accelerate

00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:06,480
the adoption of finrax so so

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:10,240
i um so certainly from my perspective

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:12,079
is you know providing access to

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,560
reference data sets that kind of have

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,320
got example transactions that kind of

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,440
really dig into the detail of

00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,920
this is the sort of thing you're going

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,800
to see when you start hitting

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,240
you know real customers um yeah there's

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,320
there's a gap there that

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,920
everybody's going to hit um when they

00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,359
roll out and there's a gap there there's

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,480
going to be kind of different in kind of

00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:33,280
different countries

00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,520
so you know uh i would love to see a way

00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,520
that we can start to make that available

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,960
that people can just kind of yeah pull

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,880
off the shelf it's like yeah

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,560
here's the sort of data we can we've got

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,359
a solution we think it works we

00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,640
may be tested in our country how easily

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:49,200
is that going to map over

00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,920
to other countries um and then certainly

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,480
the you know

00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,560
the supply side bits um i don't think

00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,240
there's going to be very many

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,920
fintechs that are going to provide

00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,359
unique differentiated

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:04,079
um you know value by providing

00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,800
the standardized apis right you want

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,720
those there

00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,400
off the shelf so people kind of access

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,280
them it's going to simplify your

00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,960
integration

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,480
um you're used to talking to those

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,079
externally right

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,160
you may well end up being using those

00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,440
you know within your own integrations i

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,560
think the more of those that can be

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,320
available

00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,160
just the faster it's going to be for

00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,200
people to kind of spin up and start

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,400
coordinating

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,839
with other companies okay and then i

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,560
think we've got to wrap up

00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,359
victor ali do you have like just in 10

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,440
15 seconds

you know one last parting word on what

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,760
you think could help accelerate

00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,680
adoption of open banking join us in the

interchange ideas

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:46,560
about the implementation of open banking

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,839

weren't able to discuss today

00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,960
both on the technology you know the

00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,560
policy the back-end technology the

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,800
front-end technology front

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,240
so it's a very you know fast-moving

00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,839
