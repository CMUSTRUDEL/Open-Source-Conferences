The global COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed an unprecedented period of economic turmoil and instability that governments will have to overcome. Those in the informal economy are impacted the most and governments must be able to effectively mobilize large scale cash transfer programs to help them survive. Emerging from the government of Sierra Leone, based on their experiences digitizing payments to healthcare workers during the Ebola crisis, OpenG2P is a framework, community of practice, and set of open source building blocks to address the common pervasive challenges making it difficult to scale government to person payments. Fineract acts as the of the key building blocks managing wallets, accounts, and stores of value for individuals. This panel will explore the full open source stack for Open G2P and lessons learned in implementing large scale cash transfer programs.

Salton is a believer in the transformative impact of technology. He is experienced in building and scaling tech-based solutions to expanding access to much-needed information & services to the un(der)served, across Africa. Focused on Digital Financial Services (DFS) & Financial Technologies as a driver for Financial Inclusion, his competencies include Financial Inclusion Thought Leadership, Product Development and Delivery and Software Engineering: At 23, he founded iDT Labs, https://idtlabs.xyz, known for its expertise in developing & applying practical and sustainable technology to key sectors such as finance, agriculture, justice, & health through effective leadership, team-building, project planning, and delivery, fundraising, and multilateral stakeholder management. During the height of West Africa's 2014 Ebola crisis, he led the technology component of the Ebola response, implementing an innovative program that combined technology, inclusive finance, public health, and responsive governance. We broke new grounds in the use of mobile wallets, cloud computing, and open source technology to deliver scale, efficiency and achieve transparency of payments in crisis, playing a critical role in preventing the collapse of the Ebola response and recovery efforts, and the health sector as a whole in Sierra Leone. In recognition, iDT Labs was awarded the 2016 UPS International Disaster Relief Award, and Salton, the 2017 Queen's Young Leader Award.

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,039
yeah no

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,080
welcome everybody to our panel and

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,679
presentation on

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,160
openg2p so we've got joining us today

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,440
uh kisom and sultan at the moment

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,320
they're in

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,200
mumbai delhi right i always mix the two

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,360
up so

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,719
and then steve conrad's calling us in

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,280
from minnesota

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,840
so open gdp you know is something that's

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,000
emerged

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,600
led by you know sultan and some of the

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,840
others there and sierra leone you know

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,879
out of the ebola crisis and the response

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,120
they put together

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,800
to help digitize payments to the

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,640
healthcare workers there

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,000
and keysome and sultan you know have

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,120
been building out the

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,680
concept and coalition behind open gdp

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,240
as a reference architecture and a

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,520
movement

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,680
to help to digitize you know large-scale

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,439
cash transfers at the government level

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,119
which is a very prescient topic you know

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,720
given covid19

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,880
and all the responses that need to be

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,759
made to help restimulate economies and

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,520
whatnot

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,000
and so the miphos initiative you know

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,520
james and myself have been helping to

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,600
advance this effort you know helping to

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,520
align it with the the mephos and finra

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,360
architecture helping to align it with

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,680
what's going on with mojo loop

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,560
and payment hub and then steve is a

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,360
member of dial

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,840
he's helping to advance industry-wide

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,920
option

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,439
of digital public goods so dial

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,119
supporting the digital public goods

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,840
alliance that's forming that he'll speak

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,399
to

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,159
and open gdp aligns perfectly you know

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,240
as this digital public good

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,680
which helps to tie together a number of

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,680
these foundational

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,680
building blocks like accounts like

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,799
payments like digital id

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,600
so this session is aiming to educate uh

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,159
the community

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,280
on what's being brought forward here and

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,799
allow you to you know

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,640
identify opportunities that you can

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,360
become involved as i think it's a space

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,840
that

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,399
you know is very needed and others in

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,400
the finra

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,560
community aren't active about this

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,959
ongoing effort in this regard

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,080
so i'll let you all take it away and

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,280
then james you know

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,959
feel free to add in wherever you are

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,440
like on what you'd like to contribute to

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,840
the discussion too

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,560
yeah um so sorry i thought we were going

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,360
to just do a formal introduction of the

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,080
of the folks on the call um definitely

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,640
we want to introduce this concept and

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,440
we want to talk about how it is related

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,280
to the apache finrac project

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,040
we're also going to cover some of the

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,400
tool sets that have been developed and

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,519
some of the tool sets that have yet to

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,879
be developed

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,239
this is going to really pick up on

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,800
some themes that we've talked about

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,200
earlier which is orienting the project

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,680
towards use cases and making it useful

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,480
to the world and two connecting it to

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,680
other projects

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,200
so apache finrac by itself

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,800
does certain things but when you connect

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,840
it to other things like mojo loop for

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,800
payments

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,360
like an identity system like a

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,280
government

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:18,239
payments government uh transfer

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,319
effort you you get to larger um larger

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,840
use cases and larger benefits

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,480
so i think with that um maybe what i

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,560
could do is i could call on

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:34,400
um on chasm to sort of give us a summary

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,159
of how this um started

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,599
uh and sultan or actually let's go with

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,200
sultan first sultan

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:43,599
how did this start um and what's that

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,480
story about

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:51,760
so i would i i would

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,799
suggest we go with uh with

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:58,560
the movie on that because okay

00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,959
does a little better job of active

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,959
later

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,840
well the fun fact is uh james that

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,720
sultan and i met

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,400
uh during our experience in ebola and

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,200
many years later

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,680
we are married with uh with children so

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,440
this is a fun fact for the audience uh

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,440
you know as they talk about use cases

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,120
but but i'd like to james uh just say

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,520
that

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,560
um you know it'd be great to start with

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,120
this overall

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,120
um intention of you know what is the

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,000
digital public good and the alliances

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,320
that are formed

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,160
to really make it youthful we have a

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,400
slight deck for the audience

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,400
uh that steve is going to kick us off

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,800
with if that's okay

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,800
great great kick us off

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,960
see if we've got thanks steve here can

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,520
you see the uh slide deck window i'll

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,080
present

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,639
here is that uh it's showing yeah you've

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,800
got it

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,160
all right yeah so uh i can do just a

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,160
little bit of framing

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,639
uh and then dive into kind of the

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,919
specifics of of open g2p

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,759
and how it connects to kind of um this

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,919
digital public goods and building blocks

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,960
concept so yeah my name is steve conrad

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,440
i am from digital impact alliance i lead

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,520
our

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:23,039
engineering team at dial and uh i'm also

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,440
a contributor to the finract platform um

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,400
particularly did some work on very early

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,600
integrations with

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,919
mojo loop platform uh

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,199
today we want to talk about openg2p this

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,560
tool for building

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,880
um for mobilizing large-scale

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,919
cache transfers but i think it's

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,639
important to have a little bit of

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,120
background

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,800
on a couple of concepts building blocks

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,400
and digital public goods

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,240
and then we can lead into openg2p so

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,160
digital public goods i mean i think

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,199
we're all familiar with open source

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,880
software and products digital public

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,840
goods have a little bit of a

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,199
narrower scope their software standards

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,440
and data sets

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,680
that have been developed and funded by

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,840
international donors to support

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,280
the sustainable development goals that's

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,759
the working definition that we use at

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,720
dial

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,680
and that other organizations that we

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,960
work with

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,000
use as well so these are tools that are

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,400
specifically

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
oriented around humanitarian efforts and

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,360
and sustainable development

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,080
goals just a little bit of background on

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,520
dial

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,160
um style was started back in 2016 and i

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,919
think

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,600
one of the first things we realized is

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,479
that

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,520
the digital public goods or dpgs as we

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,080
refer to them

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,680
the ecosystem is really fragmented we

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,000
see a lot of very sector specific

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,120
products and implementations we see

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,880
places where

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,599
there's a problem and somebody writes a

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,639
very specific solution to address that

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:58,240
problem we don't see a lot of

00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:01,280
solutions that are uh cross-sectoral

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,400
or cross or work across contexts

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,639
and so dial created the open source

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,599
center to support digital public goods

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,720
uh including finrac and many other tools

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,199
and the idea is to

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,560
address challenges around sustainability

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,120
and community

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,120
but also around interoperability and

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,240
creating more generic

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,360
cross-sectoral solutions

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,199
so uh the dpgs that that dial has

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,880
partnered with include a lot of health

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,520
tools like bomny

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,319
open lmis rapid pro is a messaging

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,680
system

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,800
uh mifos and the finrac platform

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,960
so we've worked with a variety of

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,680
different tools

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,840
that exist already in the in the digital

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,759
public goods

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:49,759
ecosystem at the same time

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:53,680
digi dial developed what we call our

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,759
sdg framework and this framework

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,479
really frames the idea of creating

00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,400
solutions for the humanitarian sector

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,479
in terms of building blocks building

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,120
blocks are generic software components

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,759
that can be

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,720
reused and can be stacked together

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,080
plugged together

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,280
into cohesive solutions we broke out

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,720
some

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,000
use cases and we saw that you know a use

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,680
case might require

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,280
an identification building block a

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,240
messaging building block a scheduling

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,479
building block

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,319
uh an integration building block that

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,199
that provides

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,800
the flow of data between systems and so

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,199
we really started to recognize that if

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,479
we can

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,719
architect um solutions

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,919
using this building block approach we

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,440
don't have to rewrite

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,039
code from scratch we don't have to

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,120
rewrite everything from the beginning

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,159
every time we can stitch these building

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,680
blocks together

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,600
into cohesive solutions and so

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,000
and then we can develop solutions

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,040
quickly that address multiple use cases

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,519
across multiple sectors

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,440
we've developed an online tool that it

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,440
is starting to create these mappings so

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,160
if you are looking for a specific kind

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,320
of building block

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,000
a messaging building block or a payments

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,640
building block or an identity building

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,920
block

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,240
we're starting to map information about

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,839
what

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,800
products are already available in the

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,240
marketplace like finrac or mojo loop for

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,800
payment solutions

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,800
and um so we're trying to provide and

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,800
curate a set of data for actors

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,600
in this space around this building

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,800
blocks architecture

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,120
um so a few months ago we were connected

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,200
with the openg2p team and we're really

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,560
intrigued by the work that they're doing

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,399
um we see

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,000
so much potential in this platform

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,160
because it aligns so well to this

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,240
building blocks approach as you'll see

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,000
um so with a bit of that background and

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,640
framing i will turn it over

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,240
to k-zom to provide some more

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,399
information about opencg

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:53,360
openg2b and where they're going

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,760
thanks so much uh stephen good evening

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,959
to

00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,320
everyone from new delhi um

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:03,040
i am a founding volunteer at opengdp

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,320
and i'm going to be talking today about

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,279
a particular use case on digitizing

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,000
the large-scale payment programs with

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:18,240
the open source building blocks

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,920
if we move to the next slide um

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,519
well you know we're in the middle of a

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,519
pandemic um

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,079
and while there are estimates that you

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,920
know uh global deaths due to covert 19

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,800
is over a million

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,760
um and and you know sadly that number

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,760
will grow

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:38,079
it is uh dropped by this enormous uh

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,680
analysis by another u.n body that says

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,600
you know 130 million

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,440
more people will be pushed to the brink

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,440
of starvation

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,680
due to because of the economic

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,240
turbulence of kobit 19.

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,959
and on this slide you will see that

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,200
almost

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,160
every government whether it's the united

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,440
states or

00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,480
countries like sierra leone nigeria etc

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,800
the global approach has been

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,800
grants and loans to governments aimed at

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,120
strengthening the national cash transfer

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,640
programs in emerging markets

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,640
um because uh you know it's basically

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,040
the the best way to get money in the

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,800
hands of people and in covet 19 we're

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,120
seeing billions and billions of dollars

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,800
being sent to people who need it

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:26,000
if we move to the next slide um

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,560
this is the basically you know what we

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,560
realized

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,720
that you know mobilizing the cash

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,160
transfers is not going to address these

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,920
systemic challenges

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,680
related to identifying and assessing the

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,079
vulnerabilities of people

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,880
and the ecosystem in a transparent

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,880
inclusive and accessible manner

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,079
which actually is possible right because

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,000
we have these great

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,519
open source tools and technologies out

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,639
there um

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,240
but those who those who you know need

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,320
the cash transfer often don't have

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,440
formal identity and

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,360
secondly er you know we also know from

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,760
our own experience in sierra leone that

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,760
if

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,959
uh you know oftentimes when the cash

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,920
transfers is done

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,360
incorrectly they can have quite a

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,399
dystopian effect

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,399
on the uh you know community in terms of

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,399
civil discontent but also in terms of

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,040
just not being able to save a person

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,519
from

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,040
you know getting access to daily food or

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,200
you know daily essentials that they need

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,320
to survive this epidemic

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,560
um if we move to the next slide um

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,760
we basically you know this is this is

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,720
quite reminisce

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,800
uh i mean it's it reminds us of our

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,519
experience in sierra leone

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,079
uh during that time i was uh leading the

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,240
u.n

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,360
program to pay the ebola response

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,399
workers

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,680
and basically um you know uh when the

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,720
ebola virus

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:52,079
struck in west africa there were

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,480
um an alarming rate of infection

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,920
and death uh especially among health

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,320
workers that were

00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,920
putting themselves at risk and therefore

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,959
to incentivize them

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,880
there was uh you know especially for

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,720
them to play this these very critical

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,600
roles of you know swabbing

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,519
of like collecting dead bodies or or

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,399
working in treatment centers there were

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,880
incentives in the form of cash transfers

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,000
but that program started having negative

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,000
consequences

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,200
very early on especially as the number

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,600
of health workers grew

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,240
from you know a mere 200 in the

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,279
beginning

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,320
uh to you know a few months later to

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:33,040
you know 40 000. um and the

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,440
the negative consequences basically were

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,920
the

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,639
issues of non-payment or fraudulent

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,839
deduction

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,560
of the payment by their supervisors or

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,399
even after

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,240
they have received the payments by their

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,240
last mile agent networks

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,440
or just you know purely late payments uh

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,920
that resulted in

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,639
nationwide strikes and and basically

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,880
abandonment

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,560
abandonment of of these you know

00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,199
critical roles that they were playing

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,959
because

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,560
you know while they they took to the

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,360
streets there was just

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,600
no more power or no response to the

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,519
significant risk that they were putting

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,600
themselves in and this really brought

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,120
the country's response apparatus to a

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,360
grinding halt

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,120
um and it also started we also started

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,320
seeing dangerous spike of infections

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,399
nationwide

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,199
but what was a turning point for sierra

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,680
leone was the digitization of the entire

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,040
cash

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,720
um delivery chain uh and it's a process

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,440
that starts with you know

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,480
uh identifying who the beneficiaries are

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,680
the recipients

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,199
uh their registration the uh assessment

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,040
of their eligibility

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,720
enrolling them to the benefits then

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,880
finally paying them

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,880
and then continuing to keep that list up

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,480
to date because in a crisis the

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,639
you know number of people who move

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,360
around um

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,000
or get added to a list is quite dynamic

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,839
and and

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,839
linked to that is the handling of the

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,440
appeals and complaints that was all

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,000
achieved through a very seamless

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,959
integration

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,839
of these steps to create a system that

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:07,600
responded very rapidly and correctly

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,600
to uh to to the

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,040
the objectives which was to basically

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,240
pay all the

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,800
uh response workers 40 000 of them on

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,720
time

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,000
the right amount based on their risk

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,839
level um

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,360
and you know in in full so

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,839
what we did with the leadership of the

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,800
government of sierra leone

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,440
well as the uh you know the team of uh

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,759
local

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,639
self-taught programmers at idt labs a

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,639
startup that

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:38,880
sultan um started and is still a part of

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,160
um among you know many other things that

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,680
he doubles in

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,519
um they applied solutions that were

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,720
built in open source that were freely

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,440
available

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,320
um technology to address the problems

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,160
within this

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,079
chain of uh of uh gas transfers

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,480
and they used like you know open data

00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:01,680
toolkit for registration

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,920
um uh uh employed odoo erp

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,120
at the central database for uh managing

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,959
enrollment

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,440
uh and and trying to maintain the

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,720
coherence of that 40 000 health workers

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,199
generating playlists

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,440
and then you using things like open vr

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,360
or facial recognition based detection

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,199
which was really important because

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,720
they were just too you know beyond

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,199
people you know um

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,920
adding names uh uh fraudulently they

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:28,079
were also just

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,759
you know so many um uh uh sort of um

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,519
names that you know had different

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,639
spellings and and without a proper

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,800
identity were

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,320
appearing as uh you know two different

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,519
people when they in fact were one p

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,279
one person um and these were all

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,959
sort of you know the different ways in

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,480
which um uh

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,399
you know from end to end from the

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,360
beneficiary to finally getting the

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,279
payments out

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,560
uh through the uh digital payments

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,040
ecosystem that

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,560
uh that was activated during the during

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,880
the ebola crisis

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,680
um really kind of leveraging a whole

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,120
suit of

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,959
open source uh um

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,919
open source solutions as well as

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:09,199
building on top wherever there were gaps

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:12,640
and this you know this delivery chain um

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:15,520
approach to digitization uh cut the

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,959
payment uh time to you know get the

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,360
payments out to

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,520
to the ebola response workers from over

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,839
one month to around like you know less

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,240
than

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,520
one week and then put an end to payment

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,079
related strikes

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,600
and in doing so it also strengthened you

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,640
know the national capacity

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,440
capacity to contain the disease

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,840
uh treat the infected but also resulted

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,200
in a huge cost savings of like more than

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:44,480
100 i mean 10 million dollars for

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,280
uh for for

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,520
for the country and and this was largely

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,280
because of the removal of duplicates and

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,160
and as i mentioned it's you know

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,320
often times it's also unintended um if

00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:01,200
we go to the next slide

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:03,600
um uh so you know that reflection

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,600
uh of what we achieved and what we

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,240
solved for in sierra leone

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,679
was ex you know was struck a really

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,120
strong code for us

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,000
uh for for me definitely for sultan i'm

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,559
sure and and

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,160
for all the partners that are part of

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,720
this open gdp initiative

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,480
because there were you know the same

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,440
challenges that we're seeing today in

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,480
terms of exclusion in terms of you know

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,200
um uh enrolling uh uh uh

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,000
people uh rapidly to receive the cash

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,080
transfers

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,400
uh in terms of you know grievance

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,880
redressal mechanisms that's responsive

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,080
and that

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,480
uh cuts across um different points of

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,960
the

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,679
sort of payment value chain and what we

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,120
want to do

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:49,760
uh basically through you know open gdp

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,360
uh is is uh you know which is which is

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,120
of course an initiative

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,280
where the government of sierra leone has

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,320
a very strong ownership as a

00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,559
as as a contributor to the uh uh

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,400
to the digital public goods uh you know

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,400
to the wider community along with of

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,520
course me for style

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,960
is uh is is trying to build a coalition

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,919
to deploy the um the solutions that are

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,840
that are available

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,360
in open source to to the problems of

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,919
cash transfers

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,520
and and you know as volunteers our hope

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,240
is really

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,160
open sourcing these um it provides other

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,760
governments and other humanitarian

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,760
organizations that are sending the

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,559
billions and billions of dollars

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,480
uh with a bootstrap of of their social

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,880
protection digitization journey

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,960
and and really kind of you know creates

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,679
that that framework

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,039
that reference point to to sort of you

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,039
know

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,080
learn from that experience but also be

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,960
able to leverage

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,360
quickly the technology and the solutions

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,640
that are

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,640
out there for the problems uh uh

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,840
that we see recurring in today's

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,960
pandemic

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,679
um if you go to the next slide um so

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,120
what is opengdp it's basically a set of

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,679
building blocks that you see in front of

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,880
you that reuses and augments

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,799
existing systems and countries um to

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,039
you know uh our and our objectives

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:15,120
really being to reduce exclusion

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,880
um to to to address grievances in real

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,919
time and and really kind of

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,799
uh remembering that exclusion oftentimes

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,080
is for

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,720
you know vulnerable segments of the

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,640
population like you know elderly

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,960
or for women who are you know not

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,080
vulnerable but often excluded

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,480
um and and this is you know um this is

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,080
really uh kind of uh

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,600
the the building blocks approach is

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,159
really to um

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,240
to so that you know governments or

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,799
programs can adopt only solutions that

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,039
address

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,159
gaps within their within their uh

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,600
program

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:52,320
um and it you know also maximizes choice

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,039
uh and interoperability with their

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,720
existing

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,200
legacy systems um so with this i'm going

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,640
to

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,120
hand it over to sultan um and we'll go

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,159
to the next slide

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:10,080
so thank you um as

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:13,760
as outlined there um our

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:16,880
in in intention is to

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,880
provide a booster

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:37,039
uh within social poor detection

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:41,360
and uh and uh and and

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:45,200
and so what we have

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:48,320
to do as she she outlined

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,760
was um was there was basically a adopt

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:56,240
a building block on approach in

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:59,520
in in in which we defined it

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:04,400
you know the the the entire

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,400
the living chain into

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:12,240
bounded context as well

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:15,840
right and build so

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:18,960
some solutions of our building blocks

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:22,240
that um um i i i guess

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:25,360
just one and an only one in the

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:29,280
pinpoint with that chain

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:34,400
and and uh and through that

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:39,280
exercise and based off the lessons

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:42,720
from the ebola implementation

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:46,159
um you know we

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:50,640
we came up about within

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:54,240
three main sets

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:57,760
so um cash transfer

00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:01,039
need to um to digitize how they

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:04,960
um they identify

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:08,400
and uh and and and

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,520
the gister the people

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,480
in into the that the

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,480
their problems so we think this this

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,919
space we realized that

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:23,039
there were a set of tools or

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:26,480
all ready and in play so for

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:30,240
example most um problems out there

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:34,080
at this time use all the dk to

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:37,679
collect um this with the records

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:41,360
but um a huge gap um

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:44,799
exists in and and how these

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,799
weapons are deep to be

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,880
catered and and and then how these

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,159
records are

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,720
very fast and so um

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,120
you know um and and and and this gap is

00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,159
this is

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:03,760
existing even more so in

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,480
in the developing world where the access

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,640
to

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:13,600
foundation identity

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:16,640
cheating is missing so um

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,919
yeah so what we did there

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:23,039
was was built um you know

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:26,240
a set of specialized tools meant

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:30,480
to um to to to

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:32,720
others these different pain points

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,720
and

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:42,559
issues out there so um an example

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:45,760
would be the deep duplication service

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:49,440
which is meant to help

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:52,880
organize his sensations keep

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,760
duplicates out out of their payment

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,400
lists

00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:01,840
um in in in in mostly deployments

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,840
you know and lack of

00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,600
identity means that um

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:15,039
you know it is it's child arranging to

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,039
to to do this but um what would be where

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,400
nomadic if

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:39,240
occasion to help on all organized

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:42,400
sessions um or or governments

00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:45,840
duplicate and and then verify

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:49,200
their list so um and an example

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:53,200
of how um we were at an

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:57,919
of the concept of using

00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:01,679
um the projects of it out there

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:05,120
would be um that the duplication

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:09,200
says the service is built on top of

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:12,720
inelastic search

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:15,679
um and the next

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,919
major source vision says this is how

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,960
these these payments

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:24,159
are made right so um as if

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,400
it starts from you've been able to

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,720
identify and then we've been able to

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,760
come up with a very clean

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:35,840
sanitized list but once

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:38,799
you once these individuals are in the

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,000
the system then big bigger building

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:43,279
becomes the

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:47,039
you know the it's a pain point

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:50,840
of how to they get to get paid

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:53,840
how are these payments lists put

00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,840
together

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:12,559
and uh um and and and and important

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:16,000
building builder within this um

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:17,039
so fusion set is the the dispersed

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,039
maintenance

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:24,000
engine which um is built on

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,399
the widget i think on religious bills on

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,159
top

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,240
of the all of them in the of them

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:32,000
throughout the meetings payments

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:36,000
um of the of the memphis department

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,440
um yeah and uh and um

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:44,799
what it does is it it provides um

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:48,720
that uh uh of ups that abs

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:52,320
obstruction um between the

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:56,159
open g2p platform

00:27:52,320 --> 00:28:00,159
and and the

00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:03,440
financial system

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:07,600
so and uh i

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:10,960
am good so the um

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:14,080
the thought um uh

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:19,440
and and and and important

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:22,720
and in most in most of the deployments

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:26,159
um a solution setting that up

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,399
has been overlooked is um

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,399
how

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,559
i have been um

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:41,440
and and what we've

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:46,960
been able to to do for this

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,960
is um shooting that

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:56,080
complaints um management

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:58,240
systems um and

00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,240
he

00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,710
[Music]

00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,759
[Music]

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,840
yeah sure if we can move to the next

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,520
slide

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,520
to the to the next one

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:37,760
this one or one more one more

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,840
so basically i mean this is just showing

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,320
you the framework and sultan's already

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,520
put

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:47,120
you know um shared uh on in the chat

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,000
the uh sort of the the link to the

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,240
github

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,760
as well as the uh you know where we

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,000
explain in detail these

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,919
uh building blocks james you know you

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,919
are an architect of this

00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,399
this thing that we see in front of us do

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,640
you want to talk about this

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,840
sure um and i do want to make sure we

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,039
leave it just uh you know at least a few

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,039
minutes for

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,799
um questions and i i think we can start

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,520
the next session maybe a little bit

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,440
later

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,559
possibly because i don't think there's

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,960
anything after that one

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,760
um so you know there are different swim

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,000
lanes here

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,080
um and it's important when you think

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,520
about a g2p

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:26,159
process that you don't over uh

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,360
focus or over index on just the payments

00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,080
disbursement

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,279
the the part that's uh that sultan's

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,840
just been talking about

00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:36,240
is the the registration uh deduplication

00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,080
verification

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,320
eligibility engine and all of these

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:44,399
things and then on the other side

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:47,039
are the um sort of management of

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,240
you know who gets it and i would i would

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,080
give an example so

00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,360
at the beginning of the pandemic the

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,919
government of

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,640
pakistan went through a very rapid

00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,600
deployment

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,399
uh using their existing tools and what

00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,840
and and

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,320
and we got to hear from somebody

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,600
involved in that uh through this process

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,080
and what they were able to do is they

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:09,120
were able to use

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,919
uh use their biometric identification

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,000
system

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,519
plus some data analytics to really

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,320
identify people who needed to be

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,159
enrolled

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,679
and to generate a good list and then

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,799
they sent it through the disbursement

00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,279
engine

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,840
um but a piece that's missing in many

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,720
places

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,120
and i i think i would include um you

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,279
know pakistan and other places is

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,320
is the beneficiary complaint mechanisms

00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,240
like

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,440
what if i didn't get the payment or or

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,640
it's the wrong amount

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,399
uh and and so

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,080
we have to think through the entire

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,519
process and so

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,720
uh we've got enrollment we've got the

00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,600
list management we've got the

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,720
disbursement

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,960
process um and and

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,159
you know in addition to sort of regular

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,559
payments um

00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,559
some governments want to have this

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,240
issued as a voucher so that it's only

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,600
redeemable for certain things for

00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,919
foodstuffs or

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,640
or for certain supplies and so you also

00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,640
need to

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,240
address some of those uh those

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,360
requirements as well

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:11,120
have i addressed that do you think

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:13,919
totally james thank you um

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,880
we can go on steve thanks so much for

00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,880
running the slides

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,320
um so i mean this is this is this point

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:25,679
you know it's just really to emphasize

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,440
that um you know it augments existing

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,039
systems so it's not coming in and saying

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,480
here just you know throw away whatever

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,080
you've been working on for the last you

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,640
know 40 50 years or

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,559
last 10 years the beauty is that it can

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,720
it's easily aligned also to

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,880
the country uh laws the local

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,320
infrastructure and ecosystem

00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:47,360
um you know uh around

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,799
identity around sort of

00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,000
consumer protect consumer and data

00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:55,120
protection uh rules and regulations

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,960
and you know the stack basically takes

00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:00,000
that into you know takes that

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,240
and really owns it in terms of

00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,200
you know providing providing solutions

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,039
or options

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:10,880
uh to users um

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:12,960
if we move on um

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,960
to the next slide uh i mean these are

00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,039
our guiding ideals it's not rocket

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,240
science but we're really motivated by

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:23,360
an intention and a deliberate intention

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,600
uh to to really serve the end users

00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,279
which are often vulnerable people often

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,080
marginalize people

00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,880
and and really you know confer uh

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,000
privacy

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,159
and security as inalienable rights uh

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,519
for them and that's really taken into

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,320
consideration

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:42,080
in the whole sort of architect design

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,679
and and the way in which the building

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,919
blocks are laid out

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,960
um and you can read certainly in greater

00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,120
detail about them

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,880
on the website as well where we actually

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,440
have a working draft that we've put out

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,519
for

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:59,120
the community's feedback um

00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,120
uh next slide

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,399
i mean you know this is basically a

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,720
shout out to all the partners and

00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,399
and one you know to recognize the

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,679
tremendous leadership of the government

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,159
of sierra leone

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,800
it's a small country but it's you know

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,000
uh it's

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,280
it's it's a it's been a very strong

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,159
contributor and

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,720
and you know the the uh wanting to give

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,200
back

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,480
uh what they've learned to the world and

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,520
then and then of course

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,159
you know mifos and dial uh james ed

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:32,320
steve the folks really kind of uh

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,879
working through thinking about

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,760
um the tech stack but also in terms of

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,639
how do you make it

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,320
available accessible for everyone and

00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,320
then i think we have just the last slide

00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,520
which is basically a shout out to

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:48,240
sultan our speaker on this panel who is

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:51,760
the key architect along with

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,679
david who is also the education minister

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,359
and the chief innovation officer in the

00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,720
government of sierra leone

00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,560
um so thanks so much sultan for

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,760
championing this really important work

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:05,119
and and for this

in new delhi and presenting this idea

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,359
which has enormous importance in

00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,760
saliency right now

00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,560
the world bank is working on you know

00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,000
this

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,000
the governments around the world are

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,440
working on this and the open source

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,880
community i think has something to say

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,880
about how we do

00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:11,760
um gdp payments uh transfer payments

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,359
using low-cost commodity software you

00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,000
know providing the best value

00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,400
and and building out an ecosystem around

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,240
this

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,760
so i hope people will join take a look

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,480
at the documents take a look at the

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,520
github

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,480
sultan is an amazing um

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,880
inspiration to us so thank you thank you

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,640
all

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,320
and we'll move on to oh is there an

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:36,160
overarching gdp api being defined

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,160
yes um

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:44,079
that is a good question and

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,760
uh i think it goes to how the components

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,599
are being related to each other

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,119
so i don't think there's a single api

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,320
there are apis that talk to different

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,760
components

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,320
and then i think if you look at the

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,839
overall domain of the apis

00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,000
um i think we should probably have a

00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:00,880
discussion about that i mean sultan

00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,560
um maybe we would make that something

00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,839
that we put on the list

00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,400
um uh something to to try to describe

00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,800
but

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,720
it's it's that would be great sankar we

00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,520
would love to have your participation

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,320
so so reach out um and uh and we'll

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,000
follow up

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,280
all right i think with that guys we

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,320
should we should move over to the next

00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,280
session and i

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,839
just want to say thank you um again for

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,839
