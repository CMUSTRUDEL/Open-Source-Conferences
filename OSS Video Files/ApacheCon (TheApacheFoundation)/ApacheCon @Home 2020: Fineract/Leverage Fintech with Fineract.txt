[Music]

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,920
so what i wanted to talk

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,760
today is one of the things that we

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,640
as feature are seeing um

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,440
in in the in the last years as a as a

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,000
trend

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,480
is how fintechs are leveraging their

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,280
capability their capabilities on top of

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,280
finrac

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,320
and this is something that is a it is a

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,559
big trend

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,440
and it's something that that that we as

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,559
fitters

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,680
are uh very proud of and and

00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,879
and it's mostly our biggest contribution

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,159
bringing new users

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:08,240
new people new companies new new

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,240
vendors to the community so

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,080
a little bit about me uh i've been in

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,759
fintech since 2009

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,799
um i've been in the finrac and open

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:26,320
source community since 2014

um i've been contributing

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,159
and involved in the methods initiative

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,040
before finrax started before finra was

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,000
finrak

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,560
and and i was part of the the me first

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,200
team

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,799
the rehearsal initiative team that that

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,680
uh expanded

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,680
the reach through the through south

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,960
america i was first ambassador of the

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,159
memphis initiative

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,880
and then i was um director of of

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,600
business

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,159
the development in the mythos initiative

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,280
after

00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,640
after mephos i briefly joined gwellap

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,759
and and then i with my business partner

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,399
robert jacket we founded fitter and

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,080
and and because we saw the opportunity

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,039
for fintechs and other financial

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,480
institutions

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:15,520
that needed the that needed

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,480
uh a global and and

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,680
an experienced partner to implement

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,560
develop and

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,640
and and and leverage on top of of of

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,800
finra

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:32,000
ah so and also i'm a proud father of uh

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:37,840
11 month old baby

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,840
liam which is in the picture over there

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,760
so why why open source for fintechs that

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,640
that's a very

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,360
that's the first question so what when i

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,920
am

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,760
i'm approached by a fintech that is

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,000
looking for a solution

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,040
as a core banking solution like finrac

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,519
or any other

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,959
core banking solution there are tons of

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,599
core banking solutions

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,200
and and we street in feature we

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,000
categorize

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,120
the the vendors of bim of banking

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,159
solutions in three

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,239
so we have the big ones the global ones

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,440
that are multiple countries that are

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,640
multinational

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,879
that are generating revenues in the

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,319
orders of the billion dollars per year

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,480
or 500

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,640
500 at the 500 millions of dollars per

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,920
year up to a billion dollars per year

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,519
those are the big guys the ibm the sap

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,720
is the temenos the

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,840
no you know the names those are the

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,879
series a then you have

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,159
an another layer which are the the

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,879
original ones that

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,360
are companies that are in the hundreds

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,000
the

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,280
tens of to hundreds of millions of

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,159
dollars in revenue

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,640
they're working in in in the region like

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,000
they

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:59,519
they cover uh a big country like nigeria

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,080
on on and africa and they cover

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,879
europe they cover us they cover latin

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,959
america

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,000
but they are not global they they are

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,480
regional ones

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,120
because they they are very good at the

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,640
local

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,640
uh regulations and the and they work in

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,639
five to three to five different

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,959
countries in indian region

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,759
those are the the middle ones and then

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,840
you have the

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:27,120
the base the the the small ones that are

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,000
basically working on a single country

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,880
the in every country that we we work and

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,160
we operate

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,600
there's always uh a vendor that has

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,040
more than 60 or 70 in some cases 80

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,040
percent of the market

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,720
of the of all financial institutions

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,360
small financial institutions the big

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,440
banks

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,479
the big financial institutions work

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,280
usually with the

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,720
the big vendors but the rest of the

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,680
financial institutions

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,199
they work with these regional or or or

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,240
local vendors

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,360
and and and finrac today it's it's

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,759
playing the game

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,960
in the first and second tier we are

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,680
competing

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,440
basically with the local vendors but we

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,160
are region we are global

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,759
so we have the capability of deliver a

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,280
global product that is being

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,600
used in in multiple countries but

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,039
and and and and today we are playing

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,919
with little ones with the

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,320
the the the the little vendors and those

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,880
are

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,440
the ones that we compete but this is the

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,320
start

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,479
so for a fintech it makes a lot of sense

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,720
to join an open source community first

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,680
if you're a fintech usually you're a

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,400
startup

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,360
if you're a startup you want to build

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,240
something that is

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,039
new you want to build something that is

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,199
different

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,960
you want to retain your ip your

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,680
intellectual property because

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,160
if you're a startup your valuation is

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,440
going to be

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,320
much bigger if you have intellectual

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,520
property that

00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:01,039
if you only have um uh

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,919
uh resources or you have only have

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,960
clients

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:08,960
so if you want to

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:12,000
to to to have a startup if you want to

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,800
to create something new it doesn't make

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,280
sense

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,039
to create something new on top of what

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,919
everybody else is using

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:24,639
so as i told as we saw

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,280
finra competes with the the local

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,759
vendors

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,639
mostly and the regional vendors uh

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,600
usually

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,160
uh but but and and if you want to build

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,280
something

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,000
if you want to offer to your clients a

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,080
different

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
uh uses a different ux a different ui a

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,080
different experience

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,720
that your competitors are usually

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,520
usually our local competitors

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,680
it doesn't make sense to use the same

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,400
system that your competitors are using

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,039
because first you're going to start

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,520
losing

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,560
and and investing your small resources

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,720
that you have

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,800
by a technology that's it's already

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,080
available as an open source

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,280
uh contribution then you are not going

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,720
to be able to

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,440
to to build on top of the of the

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,160
property software usually if you build

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,840
some property

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,520
software if you license operator

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,759
software it makes

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,680
it is expensive and you are one of the

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:25,039
clients that is going to be

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,520
uh using the system and you're not going

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,360
to be

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:32,400
uh able to to um

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,560
to to contribute and to to use that that

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,120
that system and the features that you're

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,599
building

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:42,639
are uh owned by by the property

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,960
software vendor so

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,319
also it makes a lot of sense if you're a

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,520
fintech to join the

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,919
the finra community because it it it

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,440
makes

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,039
um it makes uh

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,759
it it makes sense because you don't have

00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:01,199
recurring cost you have

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,919
uh uh no license fees you don't have to

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,360
pay

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,560
any vendor for for the for the right to

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,280
use the software

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,039
because again it's open source and and

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,160
one of the things that for me it's more

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,919
viable and and

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:19,520
always tell the the the the

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,000
our prospects and clients why you should

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,680
be

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,440
uh joining an open source community it's

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,199
because of the community

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,399
uh we infinera are a community

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,839
and and and i always we always as a

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,159
human beings and

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,599
and and and some community of of

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,240
developers and

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,399
and business leaders in finra a

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,200
community all performs individuals

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,680
whether it's a it's a it's a company or

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,080
whether

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,680
it's a software project at the end of

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,240
the day

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:57,120
in the long run or the short run i hope

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,720
the community of builder the community

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,080
that builds finrac

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,560
it's going to be bigger and stronger

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,600
than

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,640
any other property software vendor

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,800
that can be around because we are

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,880
hundreds and we are going to be

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,680
thousands of contributors

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,120
that we are working in in the in the

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,040
global in the world

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,120
that are going to contribute and we are

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,680
going to make this project even better

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,480
and better

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,200
every day so that is some it's

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,399
unbeatable

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,920
so you are going to join a project that

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,000
is led by a community

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,839
that is not going to stop and that is

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,920
going to grow and it's going to create a

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,160
standard way of doing

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,200
financial institutions and financial

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,200
services provider

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,480
so what are the the fintechs that we are

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,720
seeing

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,920
using finract uh in in in our experience

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,000
so fintechs it's a you know fintech it's

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,760
a it's a weird it's a it's a new

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,839
kind of new uh term terminology

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,320
it's been around for many years but it's

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,680
been used in use in the last five

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,959
six years ago last six to ten years

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,720
it's been very very used the the the

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,760
fintech technology

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,120
so what we are seeing in in these days

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:22,480
are mostly lending fintechs

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:26,000
uh that are um typically

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:30,480
online originators so the lending

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,279
industry it's a it's a retail industry

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,079
basically uh if you if you see the the

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,200
past the

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,959
the last the the the the past the

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,000
history that that we

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,200
that we have most banks most financial

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,240
institutions

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,040
were uh having a lot of branches they

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,480
have

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:54,399
different branches they have um

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:58,000
uh a lot of uh capillary capillarity

00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:01,680
uh on top uh and and a lot of

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,399
access to the people in in in a retail

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,480
way

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,800
so the financial lending space it's

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,519
about selling money and and they sell

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,399
money

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,200
as a retailer and what happened with

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,160
retail

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,160
we know e-commerce and and e-commerce

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,760
kills retail and is killing riddle and

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,760
the e-commerce is growing growing

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,800
growing and more with the pandemic

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,760
so the same is going to happen and it's

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,279
happening

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:32,399
to the uh to the lending space

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:36,079
so we are seeing more and more uh

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:38,880
online retails that are selling money

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,600
which is lending or fintech in this

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,160
space

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,600
and these companies are are the ones

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,800
that are most interested

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,839
in using finra and and they will be more

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,839
and more in the future

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,160
we are seeing some of them implementing

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,440
and we have experience in

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,839
in in many in the four continents of

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,720
of fintechs and lending companies that

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,000
are

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,079
using finrac as the core banking because

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,519
the benefits of finrax that i'm going to

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,600
show later

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,200
but this is one of the biggest and

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,200
hottest spaces

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,399
the lending fintechs that are using

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,600
finra and

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:18,160
mostly online originators that

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,880
they they don't have any branch they are

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,519
an

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,279
e-commerce and the product that sells

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,519
its money

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,720
then we are seeing neo banks and neo

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,959
banks are are

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,880
that are new banks basically our digital

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,160
banks our banks that don't have any

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,600
branch

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:39,040
are banks that are fully digital

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:42,800
so they they need to build their

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,480
their presence on top of a of a standard

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,639
and on top of robust

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,399
platform and they are and some of them

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,160
are choosing finra some of them are

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,079
choosing vendors but again the same

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,200
problem of probably there is software

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,880
they will face and and and we are seeing

00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,000
some of these new bands

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,639
and migrating from uh from the

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,880
vendor that they have chosen to finrak

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,800
because they realize the potential

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,000
and the benefits of an open source

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,079
project

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,200
also we are seeing new wallets the

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,519
wallets

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,880
on the contrary of of neo banks are new

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,120
banks it has

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,079
all the all the capabilities of a fully

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,800
fledged fund

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,560
they have accounts they have loans you

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,560
can open an account you can have

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,680
loans you can have credit cards debit

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,560
cards uh

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,399
insurances whatever investments all all

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,519
of the things that you have on a re in a

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,560
regular bank

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,000
the neo banks are able and capable to

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,240
give it to you

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,600
because of regulation and because of of

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,079
the business offering

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,800
and there and some of them are using

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,519
finra

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,199
as their core banking application also

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,199
we have e-wallets

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,560
from e-wallets deferred from new banks

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,199
that the e-wallets are

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,480
just accounts and and a credit or

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,680
payment

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,880
basically there are an an account linked

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,600
to a debit card

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,480
and and and with that link they allowed

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,760
to

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,880
pay on and use that debit card either

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:12,000
digitally or in a brick and mortar

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,959
merchant so these these e-wallets are

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,360
also using

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,399
finrac as their core banking application

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,519
where they can

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,920
store their accounts they can use all

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,920
the

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,320
funeral capabilities to to create the

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,839
account to track transactions to

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,360
to to generate new accounts the kyc et

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,279
cetera et cetera

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,519
also we have seen some peer-to-peer

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,079
lenders peer-to-peer lenders it was like

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,240
a

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,240
big movement that now it's kind of

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,639
fading off because of the complexities

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,839
and regulation complexities on

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,720
on on the on the on how a peer to peer

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,720
lend their

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,720
work so uh i usually

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,639
so basically a peer to peer it's it's a

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,760
company that that

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,880
needs to in it's a fintech and

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,399
also it's a startup that it's struggling

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,839
in two directions

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,480
they need to get lenders and they need

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,519
to get

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,399
borrowers and usually uh

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,000
the financial institutions have a few

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,959
big lenders

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,279
people that that give them money to lend

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,760
and

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,600
and they have a lot of borrowers and the

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,000
the struggle for these companies

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,560
usually is not on the borrower's side

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,680
because it's it's fairly easy

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,440
at some levels to get people to lend

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,680
money

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,720
if you offer money everybody will say i

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,120
want money just

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,040
give me money i need money i always need

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,720
money i can do anything you want with

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,040
money

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,680
i want with money that that but the

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,160
difficult part is to choose

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,759
who to lend okay everybody will accept

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,959
the money but not everybody is going to

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,880
repay the money

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,399
but the peer-to-peer lenders have the

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,600
two too difficult

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:58,720
they need to get basically uh

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,519
uh one or two uh lenders for each

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,240
borrower

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,199
so they need to focus on building the

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,399
two communities

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,360
at once which is very very very

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,600
complicated and

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:15,680
and we haven't seen a lot of these uh

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,519
peer-to-peer lenders succeed but

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,959
many of them are very interested on

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,600
building their solution on top of

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,399
interact

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,160
because of the of the capabilities on

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,240
the on the final platform

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,680
they can they can implement whatever

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,720
they want they can implement the both

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,839
parts they can

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,720
they they surely can modulate and and

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,880
and replicate and track the life cycle

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,360
of the loan of the asset

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,800
from start to begin from start to end

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,800
they are going to do that

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,920
on top of interact and from the borrower

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,800
where they can

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,920
track how much money the borrower and

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,519
the investor

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,360
how much money they put the truck

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,399
interest et cetera et cetera

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,720
so um uh and

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,079
and and that's something that it's very

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,519
very uh

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,680
very good for the peer to peer

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,360
and then we have payment and collecting

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,480
companies when i call payments and

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,480
collecting companies are are like uh

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,000
they are not like e-wallets but they are

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,679
like more

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,400
agent networks you know um uh companies

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,000
that

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:23,280
create a network of different agents

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,439
where you can go to that physical agent

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:29,039
usually it's a kiosk usually

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:32,400
it's a small merchant with a device

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:35,840
whether it's a pos or an android device

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:39,520
with an app inside there we see

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,720
a few of them using finrac as the core

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,760
application

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,000
to replicate and to and to and to

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,960
uh and to modulate their business the

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
business case

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,039
on top of internet it's not exactly what

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,080
finnegan was

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:57,280
meant for but it can be used and

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,320
if you are a little bit clever with a

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,320
few tricks and

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:05,919
uh with few customizations and a lot of

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:09,600
configurations you can use finrac

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:12,840
as a excellent platform for um

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,640
for a payment network for an agent

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,960
network

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,000
uh i'm seeing the chat there's no

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,960
questions so

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,840
i'm moving on i don't know if if if you

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,960
are reading

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,960
correctly the the slides if everything

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,080
is okay

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,760
i can't hear you but i can

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:37,440
read whatever you put on the chat

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,440
if nothing i will move on

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:46,000
so why why in finra

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,720
and that's that's uh that's another big

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,720
question

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,720
uh and and i think that that

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:58,160
fintechs are are coming to finra because

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,720
for many reasons but if i want to put

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,600
like the

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,960
the the top five reasons these are the

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,120
top five reasons this

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,160
the first number it's it's my number

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,360
it's not

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,280
it's something that i don't have um

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,280
it's it's based on my experience in

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:17,039
finra

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:19,679
and and we know the actual

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,280
users that we know we know how many

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,760
people is contributing

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,799
but we don't know what we don't know so

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,320
if we can

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:31,840
assume that there is one thing like user

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,440
per one that we know and and for that

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,160
finite user that we know there is

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,240
another finite user that we don't know

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,200
the number of the community of funeral

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,080
users in this community is around 1 000.

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,559
and i unbelieve that this 1000 because

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,480
and

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:51,280
and i'm always knowing uh

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,160
people that is using miphos and finrac

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,400
that they never

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,320
contributed anything that they never go

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,559
it went to the

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,240
went to the source code to the community

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,360
and we didn't we didn't know that they

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,240
were using finra

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,159
before and they they are running a

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,360
company on top of interact or

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:11,520
what used to be me false so

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,679
i think that today the community of

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,480
finra it's around 1000

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,000
financial institutions in 40 countries

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,200
which put us

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,400
as big in the level of the big

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:28,159
vendors now it's on on reach

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,799
and and and and and platform users

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,520
put us in the level of the of the big

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,120
vendors

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:37,840
the worldwide vendors not in

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,360
in maybe in in capabilities not in

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,400
revenue whatever but in

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,360
number of people using and financial

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,799
institutions

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:50,159
using the the platform we are

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,559
at that level the second thing that

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,440
people

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,159
really enjoy really love about finrak is

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,280
they open

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,440
and the rest apis this is

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,600
this is key this is this is the most

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,000
important feature that we have

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,280
because fintechs and financial

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,799
institutions

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,520
are in a different game now they used to

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,919
be

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,360
financial institutions used to be big

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,799
balls of money

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,840
they will they they used to be places

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,720
where people

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,000
uh put their money and and they and they

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,200
put the money to

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,720
uh to to collect to to save

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,440
and to to protect i have a question 100

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,919
1000 financial institutions the users

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,000
are

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,120
are companies that are running their

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,240
operations

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:41,200
on top of interact that's that's the

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,200
number one thousand

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,159
sorry i'm so um and

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,000
and and now the game has changed the

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,360
game is connected

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,280
now your company it's value

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,280
if you have connections connections to

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,360
payment network connections to agents

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,400
connections to

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,799
credit cards debit cards uh on

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,159
so if you have a if you run a digital

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,240
company

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,320
the more connections that you have the

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,159
more valuable is your company the more

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,280
value you give to your company to your

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,480
clients

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,520
so the api functionality the rest api

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,520
functionality on

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,440
that that runs and that this

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,080
architecture of finrac

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,480
it's it's a it's a it's a it's a killer

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,799
app

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,520
it's the best thing that we have to

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,480
compete

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,440
and to and to be uh used for other and

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,600
more and more fintechs

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,960
the the capability that feature is full

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,159
web which is something that

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,520
now it's it's it's very it's kind of uh

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:47,840
it's it's something that is it's not a

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:50,880
differentiator but remember we

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,880
compete with the local vendors and and

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,799
local vendors are still

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:59,600
using 90s and 80s technologies

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:01,679
the banks are using older technologies

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,760
they're still using

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,200
mainframes and they're still using

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,559
kobold as their

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:11,440
as their software and development so

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,440
but but financial institutions fintechs

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,880
and small financial institutions that

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,760
that they are the ones that are uh uh um

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,360
using finra more and more and more they

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,559
they see a lot of value

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:27,679
being able to just open up a web browser

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,320
and and use the system everywhere in

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,679
their home

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,679
wherever they want they don't need to

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,120
invest them on servers they don't need

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,360
to invest in infrastructure

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,159
just a computer with a web browser

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,840
that's enough

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,200
and that's very important for our

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,440
clients

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,200
that that is going to be that is

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,159
resonating it's kind of the same level

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,039
to

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,159
the cloud ready upload interactive ready

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,520
and and

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:54,080
i'm i'm yet surprised that people ask me

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,240
when when i'm i'm pitching for to a new

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,600
client or new or potential client

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,400
and they asked me if if this system it's

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,559
it's been able to it's capable to be

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,679
deployed on on the on the

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:11,120
on the cloud and my question is always

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,000
we don't have clients that are outside

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,240
the cloud

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,039
so everybody is running this software on

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,279
the cloud

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,400
and that is very powerful and that's

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,960
very important

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,240
especially for fintechs that wants to be

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,320
nimble that once

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,520
they don't need to have a huge

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,120
infrastructure they

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,559
they don't want to have servers they

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,880
don't want to rely with

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,159
with hardware it's just paying for the

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,840
use that they have

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:38,159
and that it's a that it's a very good um

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,159
that's a good advantage for fintechs

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:44,000
using finra

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:48,320
and lastly the features uh and i want to

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,679
i want to uh focus on phenolic 1x

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:55,200
and not finite cn finite 1x

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,760
is uh has an incredible amount of

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,159
feature

00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,600
and it's growing and the panel that we

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,559
have previously

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,120
we were discussing on that that finrac

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,279
it's a

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,240
it's a it's a different animal from

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,159
other

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,640
open source projects because this is an

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,440
uh and consumed kind of consumer product

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,880
this is a

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:18,240
a a a product that is being

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:21,600
used by end users and not

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,240
only by technical people like other

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,880
projects

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,400
of open source like i know kubernetes or

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,679
linux or whatever

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:33,760
they are mostly used by tech people

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:37,279
that is building uh solutions using

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:40,559
that uh tool clinic it's a it's a

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,360
tool that it's it has an end it's been

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,559
used by

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:47,679
end users directly so that's a different

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,640
uh conversation and we are one of the

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,320
few

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,240
projects around the world that is

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,400
succeeding doing that

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,559
and and and i think that one of the

00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:00,080
things that are

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:03,840
defining why fintechs are

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:06,320
so happy and are adopting finra so fast

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:10,880
is because of the features the tons of

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:14,240
features that finret has

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:17,520
so the speaking of which one of the

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,600
the the the the biggest uh and the most

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,559
important features i think that that

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,240
phenerik has

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:27,039
it has hundreds uh but

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,360
what are most important and the fintechs

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:32,400
are really really interested

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:36,080
it's the rest api architecture that

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:39,279
we discussed previously the the easy

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,960
to configure financial products so if

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,400
you are an end user you're not a

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,840
technical person you're just

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,120
a financial expert uh and and you're not

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,200
you're not a coder you're not a

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,720
programmer it's really

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:55,840
it's really easy using the mifos ui

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,679
to configure new products to create new

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:02,320
products within a range of

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:05,440
presets products you have a variety

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,120
of things that you can do with with the

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,679
finra

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,840
and and when refused for instance the

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,360
loan the asset products the account

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,840
products the kyc

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,720
those are things that that you can do on

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,360
top of the

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,440
the top of finra that you don't need to

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,240
be a programmer you don't need to be an

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,520
expert

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,520
to to be able to use this this platform

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,799
and that is something that is very

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,679
unique and it's

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,240
it's empowering and it's leveraging the

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,799
uses

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,840
the usage of fintech's business of

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,679
finrax by fintechs

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,960
and also that we are cloud-ready and

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,080
agnostic

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,240
of which cloud so finra can be

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,279
implemented on any open cloud

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:52,240
uh made also in a private cloud and

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:55,200
you can implement if you want on-premise

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:58,480
i don't see why you will do that but

00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,720
if you want to do it you can do it so

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,720
we've seen implementations and live

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,080
implementations of interact

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:10,000
in google cloud in amazon cloud

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:12,080
in in in microsoft cloud

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,320
we didn't have us as a company

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,960
experience doing that on red hat cloud

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,640
but we

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,279
for sure we are going to see that in the

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:22,320
next in the in the near future

00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:24,720
so it's it's really we are agnostic of

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,240
in which uh infrastructure you want to

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,039
implement finra

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,679
it runs on everyone and and it runs very

00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,080
well

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,960
and it does a lot of the of the work

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,279
that you need

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,720
if you're a fintech and and and the rest

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,000
that you need to build

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,200
uh uh it's it's it's it's possible to

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,840
build because

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,840
finra is a product of the community

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,960
sorry and and the community

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:55,039
wants everybody to contribute so the the

00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,080
barriers to contribute

00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:01,360
code to contribute things into finra

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:04,640
are low so hence

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:08,159
if you want to use this software it's

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:11,600
it's fairly easy to to to

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:14,240
learn it and to being able to to

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,120
be a productive developer on top of

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,399
internet

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,279
because there is fairly good

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:21,600
documentation there is it's easy

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,640
and and the code is it's very well done

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,080
so you can

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:29,039
uh in in in in short

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,399
time you are going to be productive uh

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,039
running the system

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,399
and running the code and being able to

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,960
uh

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,080
to generate features and and more

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,159
functionalities

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,640
either to your company or the community

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,640
hopefully

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:51,600
so uh this is my

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:55,600
my talk i i now open to questions

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:59,360

um ask me any question

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:38,480
about why fintechs are using finrac or

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,480
any other things that you want

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,080
if not

00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:44,640
[Music]

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,600
again the next session is going to start

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,039
in

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:53,760
a few minutes you can

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,760
checking the sessions panel

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:06,399
so any questions

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,360
do you have any training on finra we do

00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,880
have

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,519
uh we do train uh

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,279
there's a on the community side in the

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,559
mephos page there's a lot of

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:22,399
in videos and there's a lot of

00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:26,000
material and documentation

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:29,279
but we as fitter we contribute

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,919
to the we have a

00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,880
training for developers advanced

00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:37,919
training program

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:41,279
and and basic training program uh

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:44,000
here is my email so you can send me

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:47,840
an email and i can send you more

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,840
information about the training

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:57,440
where would i find groups using finrac

00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:00,720
the the the best place to go is the

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,480
finrac dev list there

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,640
there you have a lot of features you

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:08,240
there's a a

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:11,679
a few there's a slack channel there's uh

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,200
another chat application that ed maybe

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,720
can help us

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,080
answer that but the the main place that

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,679
you can go

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:24,799
and ask for groups for for communities

00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:29,840
you should finrak is the dev group

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,840
dev list at finra apache

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,880
do fintechs raise any any concerns about

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,159
open source when pitching

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,559
them security competition

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,240
they always ask about security but that

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,720
is something that that that

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,519
it's it's always the same thing with

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,760
open source

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,039
people is i don't know why people is

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,399
concerned about

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:59,120
security in open source whether

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:01,039
the most insecure systems are the

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,840
privilege software but

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,919
i don't know it's just uh they created

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:10,000
the the the rumor that

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:12,880
open source is is uh it's insecure

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,559
so um but that that's something that

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,919
it's it's easily

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:20,559
explained and people understand it

00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,840
i think that that the major concern that

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:25,120
they have is about

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:27,600
support and and and when they say okay

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,960
but who is going to help me when when

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,960
something happens

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:36,080
and and and that the big

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:40,080
pitch for them and the bigger the bigger

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,120
the best uh thing that we can say to

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,960
them is

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,320
when you join a finer act when you join

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,440
an open source community

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:51,200
you are not locked by a vendor

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:53,519
you are not you can choose

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,120
whatever you want from the community

00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,640
there are plenty of vendors

00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,240
that can help you with finra in

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,039
different countries you have local

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,840
vendors regional vendors global vendors

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,440
but the good thing about joining a

00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,699
community like finra

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,560
is that um

00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:14,240
[Music]

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:17,359
you don't you are not uh locking

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,879
with a single vendor and that's the

00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:22,240
biggest concern

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:23,119
and the biggest the biggest attribution

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,079
of being

00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,079
part of a community

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,159
so um do you have concerns about

00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,679
contributing upstream because it removes

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,560
competitive advantage

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,960
how do you address that sometimes they

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,240
do

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,480
and and so what we

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,480
in feature what we try to do is to

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,760
encourage our all of our

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:57,599
clients to to contribute back

00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:00,640
the the source of what they develop

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:04,160
some of them want some of them doesn't

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:07,440
and if i told them uh one of the biggest

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,440
things of of of building their

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,880
application building the company on top

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,560
of interact is

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:17,040
uh retaining the ip the preparatory

00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,920
uh of course they are not going to be

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,440
willing to

00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,800
contribute back but having people using

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,400
the software having people

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:29,440
using the system it's powerful enough

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,000
and it's good enough for them to to be

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,960
able to

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,599
contribute back and to make the

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,200
community

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:40,720
a bigger a bigger community and and and

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,640
as we grow with companies as we grow

00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,560
with users

00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:48,880
we are going to uh grow with uh

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,640
with contributions that that's something

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,880
that for me it's clear

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,000
and it's something that that that it's

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,040
it's it's it's

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,040
uh it's part of of why

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,240
for us it's very important to to get

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,240
back to the contributions

00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:13,680

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,760

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:27,520
um well

00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:31,200
finrax supports all type of currencies

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,200
it's a multi-currency system

00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,040
and and hello can you see me

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,880

00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:44,480
know if you see me

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,359
yes okay so finrax supports all

00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,720
currencies

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:49,440
um and and of course you can support and

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,200
you can

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:56,480
um create a bitcoin

00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,920
a btc currency and and it's going to

00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,480
support it

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,119
what it doesn't have it's uh it's a

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,990
wallet

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,240
it's a it's a

00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:06,880
[Music]

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,240
crypto wallet and i think that this is

00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,599
something that we

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:14,400
should uh include in the

00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,480
community and in the in the project

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:21,240

a built-in uh crypto wallet

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,800
it's something that is going to be

00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:35,119
