	To Infinity and Beyond: Scaling Fineract for the Enterprise.
Avik Ganguly, Nayan Ambali, Ed Cable, Istvan Molnar, Victor Romero

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

This panel discussion will showcase a number of institutions that have extended to Fineract to support different use cases at scale including lending, payments, wallets, and digital credit. They will discuss the platforms enhancements they made along with the DevOps strategies to help scale Fineract to reach millions. They will also explore the practical ways in which the community could achieve greater performance in the upstream Fineract codebase, the roadmap to achieve the same, and replicable tools the community can collaborate on to continually improve performance on both generations of Fineract.

Avik Ganguly:
Avik Ganguly is the founder of Fynarfin, a fintech company building scalable enterprise solutions on top of Apache Fineract. Avik is a Fintech specialist and open source evangelist who picked up his trade while working with Mifos, Conflux and Novopay.

Nayan Ambali:
Nayan is the Co-Founder and CEO of Finflux, a leading Mifos partner, whose cloud distribution built on top of the Fineract APIs is reaching more than several dozen financial institutions serving more than 3M clients and a portfolio greater than $2.5B USD.

Ed Cable:
Ed has been a part of the Mifos project since 2007 in its early days at Grameen Foundation. He oversaw the open source community, connecting its members worldwide with the tools, support, and engagement needed to build and use Mifos. Leading the growth of this burgeoning community, he saw the dedication and persistence of its members and decided to found COSM (now the Mifos Initiative) to unite their efforts and help them collectively fulfill the vision Grameen Foundation set out to achieve. Prior to this, he graduated from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania where he led marketing for the nation’s largest student-run credit union and discovered his passion for technology-driven international development in their budding social entrepreneurship program. When he’s not watching over the Mifos community, he’s tending to another community of sorts, his mini-farmhouse of animals – chickens, bunnies, dogs, goats, cats, birds, and fish.

Istvan is Partner and Architect for DPC Consulting, an enterprise Java consultancy from Budapest, Hungary that has decades of experience implementing banking and real-time payment solutions at scale. Istvan has led the deployment of Mifos and Fineract at a bank in Germany as well as banks in SE Asia. Building off of the experience implementing real-time payment systems for Singapore and Hungary, Istvan has lead the design and architecture of Payment Hub EE, a powerful bridge and microservices workflow orchestration tool spearheaded by the Mifos Initiative, for integrating Fineract with real-time payment systems like Mojaloop.

but

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,240
today you know we've got a good variety

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,199
of panelists

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,200
joining us so we have ishvan molnar from

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,760

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,120
the panel

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,160
so we want to cover a number of topics

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,079
on the panel today

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,239
first off you know just starting to look

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,600
at in general across the financial

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,960
services sector

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,800
you know where is finrac and finraxion

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,800
best position to scale

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,160
and then we'll dive in a little bit more

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,680
around you know some of the best

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,359
opportunities and pain points and

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,000
challenges and scaling

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,159
each generation of the finrac platforms

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,040
we'll take a closer look at some of the

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,840
direct use cases where these individuals

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,080
have helped to

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,280
achieve maximum scalability on the

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,880
platforms

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,640
and then we want to take the discussion

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,320
in the direction of you know what are

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,400
some actionable items

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,159
to bring forward to the community as a

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,320
roadmap you know what are some of those

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,320
shared resources and pieces

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,840
that we could work on together as we

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,000
know that a lot of partners

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,159
and companies out there building

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,759
solutions on finrac have achieved

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,360
great scale but we need to bring a lot

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,799
of this back to the community

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,320
because it makes no sense for each

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,079
partner to individually be doing the

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,680
same effort time and time

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,079
again and it really would benefit from

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,920
being part of the upstream code base

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,200
so i'll be trying to moderate the

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,119
discussion today

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,840
but let's start off just by having each

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,840
of our panelists briefly introduce

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,840
themselves

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,799
uh it's fun do you want to go first yeah

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,920
yeah i can yeah

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,439
so i'm mr monarch and

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,160
working with our own company in the last

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,520
i don't know

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,959
20 plus years now and but during this

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,200
couple of years uh i was participating

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,599
in different projects or even being

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,040
working at international organizations

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:25,040
international banks so

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:28,080
get pretty deep into the financial

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:32,480
industry and

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:35,120
then the whole company of 20 30 guys

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,920
very involved in multiple projects in

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,840
europe and also in southeast asia

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:45,440
delivering software based on finra

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,519
in the last five years for the customer

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,720
specific requirements

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,200
given the regulatory reasons that needs

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,480
to be

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:58,080
customized or the scalability reasons

00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,000
that um how to handle that type of load

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,239
that they were looking for

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,280
and one additional area that i'm pretty

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,640
much involved

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,360
real-time payment kind of solutions

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,560
uh both in for example in singapore

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,560
faster payment

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,640
i was there then it was introduced in

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,080
hungary or in the european union the

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,560
super instant

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,120
payment and shortly i will also talk

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,280
about

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,560
that what we have developed delivered on

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,879
the payment

platform as a service offering as well

00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:02,080
along with that we build um some bespoke

how to transition away from legacy

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,840
technology which

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,840
impacts their business

and fintech youndo

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,560
hello we are i am

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,960
victor romero we have been working with

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,280
financial institutions here in mexico

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,479
and

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,680
latin america the financial

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:58,160
institutions are banks our

00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:01,680
social cooperatives and well

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,919
we have done developments on top of

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,520
finrak and finneraxian

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:11,600
integrating payment hubs integrating

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:15,120
also mobile application like wallets or

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,840
mobile payments only and we

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,039
we accomplish with the local regulation

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,400
depending of

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:25,600
of the country that's it

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,600
thank you thank you victor

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,880
yeah so the first you know question i

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,720
wanted to

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,680
propose to our panelists today was

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,320
really you know from your experiences

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,000
what have been ideal target markets to

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,479
you know leverage the core strengths of

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,080
either finrac or finraxian and what have

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,199
you seen as like the most

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,000
ideal and use cases to scale on either

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,800
generation

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,479
of the platform so anybody feel free to

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,600
jump in with their experience

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,800
um i would come with one

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:03,199
idea to this that

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:05,120
an interesting use case for finra

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,199
that many global institutions are

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,160
struggling with their existing

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,639
core banking platforms and it's always a

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,440
case

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,680
that if you come down to the numbers

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,120
that how much does it cost for me for a

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,479
single account

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,800
and if i get a customer could i afford

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:26,080
this with that expensive technology

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,680
legacy let's see what i have and many of

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,600
these institutions looking for an

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,400
alternate solution to bring in

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,000
a lot of additional customers who

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,479
doesn't work with their existing

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,440
systems but they look for an alternate

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,919
solution

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,800
uh those customers typically do not

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,360
require

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,440
extremely sophisticated services and

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,919
extremely sophisticated components

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,840
and this is where finra could fit into

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,479
an existing landscape

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,199
and that's really uh i believe a huge

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,199
area to grow

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:03,680
i agree with a lot of what is one said

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,240
like for example maintaining a savings

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,680
account

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,599
in one of these four banking

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,560
implementations in india takes around

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,000
the

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,400
13 uh per month

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,759
and when the customer doesn't maintain

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,199
enough balance

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:21,360
the banks like impose not maintaining

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,759
monthly average balance fees

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,479
which is where the exclusion happens

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,199
even though

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,919
government through programs have made

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,440
everyone

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,360
open an account in these institutions

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,800
those accounts are not really usable

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,360
because of these fees

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,400
due to minimum balance which results in

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,120
like

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,039
300 to 400 million government banking

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,280
accounts in india

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,319
and that is where a lot of opportunity

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,319
for finner exists

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,919
was this finrak 1.x or finrax cn or both

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,319
platforms would you say

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:01,599
when you mentioned this as an ideal use

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,160
case in the target platform

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,800
i had the opportunity to talk with

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,560
different

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,759
institutions and they do have different

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,960
appetite

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:16,400
so some of them like

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:19,520
once you come out from the mainframe era

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,919
and then java and the

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,280
so-called monolith is a huge jump

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,160
already

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,479
some who did already that exercise then

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,879
they

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,000
say that now everything must be micro

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,719
services

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,959
regardless does it make sense or not but

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,240
like this needs to be on the

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,479
presentation for the ceo so it's tricky

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,719
that it's not really depends that

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,959
what the platform is capable to do

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,000
rather than buries the institution with

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,920
the marketing

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,600
and they are buying in that everything

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,720
must be micro service or not

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,040
so based on that clearly

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,480
to make a decision that for this

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,600
institution i rather

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,800
suggest a cn-like solution because

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,279
that fits to their idea

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,959
of a core banking platform meanwhile for

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,839
others who

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:12,160
had different concept different approach

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,920
they were happily satisfied

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,040
with um with the finra one point x

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,680
version

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,480
with the addition that it needs to fit

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,600
to their

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,480
existing ecosystem meaning that data

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:30,000
warehousing reporting to be extracted

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,000
and and like even front and for example

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,560
they wanted to integrate into their

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,279
relationship managers front-end so it

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,399
become

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:41,120
an important component but it's not

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,600
alone the core banking platform for them

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,120
just

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:48,560
an important component in that sense uh

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,760
the one point x extremely fits uh

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,000
what what they wanted

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,440
thanks ishvan and then victor i know you

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,399
know for some of the customers you've

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,360
worked with

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,160
they made that calculus analysis between

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,320
one.x

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,240
and cn can you explain a bit of that

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,600
process in which direction you went

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,360
and why yes

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,360
for for the customers that we have

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,600
integrating

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,880
vault systems we are using finrac

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,480
as the loan origination system

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:25,200
and the calculation of the

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,160
loan accounts and the maintenance will

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,440
be

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,279
in this platform and on the other hand

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,320
we're using finrax

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:37,360
and the the deposit

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,760
this one disbars meant in this platform

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,160
because the escapa is scalability that

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,200
we have

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,399
developed for for this another platform

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:52,000
because we are expecting

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:56,079
well our customer to handle more than

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,360
20 millions of debit accounts

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:02,320
and we need to integrate with atm

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,839
and point of sales and also with the

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,720
digital channels like

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,959
internet banking and mobile banking so

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,320
that's the reason that financial will be

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,800
the bad one

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:18,560
for the workload

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:21,360
that that is expected the customer

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,640
and the integration between these two

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,000
platforms

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,120
is on top of two tools one is the the

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,200
vpn

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:34,480
which is cv and the other is gravity

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:43,040
which allowed us to expose the

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:44,640
apis in the open banking specifications

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,240
thank you and we are definitely going to

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,320
come back to some of the

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,079
benchmarks and scalability targets you

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,720
were able to achieve and how

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,839
in a moment and then avec uh like from

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,920
your experiences

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,720
where would you say are the you know

00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,600
ideal use cases for either finrac 1.x or

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,600
finrax cn

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,600
um that includes all the capabilities we

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,760
have

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,320
like that includes payments deposits

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,320
loan collections

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,480
although some of them needed a bit of

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,320
tweaking and

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,760
additional components such as the

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,120
payment have definitely helped

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:24,639
a lot right

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,519
and we were able to achieve considerable

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,519
scale

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:33,920
with by squeezing out optimizations on

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:36,720
finrac itself and most of the

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,720
teams were happy with the payment schema

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,680
connectors being separate from the core

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,000
services

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,000
even

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,639
right

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,160
and then ishvan and avik you know

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,399
especially around finrac.1.8

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,880
like what were some of the pain points

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,959
or bottlenecks you had to overcome

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,160
to achieve the scalability targets when

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,519
you were

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,519
addressing those for your customers

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,959
and what

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,480
we have seen

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:18,560
that we we touched upon

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,800
yesterday that the batch processing part

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,240
of the system

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,639
and again it depends on the requirements

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,600
in a

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,959
traditional setup you have plenty of

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,600
time during the night

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,639
to run those batch processes no one else

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,639
is working

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,839
or actually all the other systems are

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,600
doing their batch

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:42,800
jobs so so if time

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,120
is there that that's not an issue but as

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,920
you get increasing the number of

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,240
accounts

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,720
i mean especially if these are loans

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:55,199
which requires some end of day

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:57,839
um heavy-duty lifting then

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,519
then you are starting to squeeze into

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,040
the given time slot

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,839
because you need to get

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,480
the gl files ready for the other system

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,160
to pick it up to process it so by the

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,199
morning for the regulators

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,240
your reports are getting ready so tuning

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,399
of these batch

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,519
processes with the one point x was

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,800
always kind of

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,519
a thing to do um

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,320
because because they have different

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,880
behavior

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,519
obviously during the generations there

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,079
were different logic as they implemented

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,120
um some is using individual accounts

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:37,120
some is using

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,680
a big bulk of uh select statements and

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,639
run those transactions through so that

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,320
requires some

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:48,720
some consideration for sure and actually

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:52,000
a consequence of this one that the

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,959
let's say business day concept was

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,920
required

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,880
and i would say that we ended up in all

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,480
of the

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:04,639
implementations that somehow

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,800
tying the system did and the business

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,920
kind of date together doesn't really

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,160
work

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,199
so so that needs that had to be

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,120
introduced so

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,519
potentially the system was running on a

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,560
different day and doing the calculations

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,680
logically

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,519
that actually the system date was and

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,120
there are places that this is already

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,079
available in the code base

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,399
but it's i would say that it's not

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,800
consistent across all the different

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,560
parts of their core base

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,959
so that's the two things that i could

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,959
bring up

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,160
thanks and welcome to some more of those

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,759
similar items when we talk

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,759
about actionable items for the the

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,079
roadmap uh

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,000
you know like could you speak to some of

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,160
like the

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,440
customers and experiences you've had in

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,000
achieving the most scale

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,759
out of either finrac 1.x or finraxian

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,680
and what you needed to do to

00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:02,240
enable and achieve that all right

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,720
so one big part was introducing the

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,880
right

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,920
tooling um initially we started

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,120
pushing data into elasticsearch through

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,079
webhooks

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,600
then we made uh an event pipeline with

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,880
kafka

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,040
and then gradually the kibana dashboards

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,560
got started using not only for

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,880
operational analytics but users started

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,040
assuming that it's the business

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,160
intelligence tool

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:37,040
and that's where we faced a lot of

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:40,720
challenges where we had to look into

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:44,399
different tools such as presto

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,680
which can do um a with distributed sql

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,199
queries

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,680
and uh encourage users to use a bi tool

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:55,839
like apigee superset or redash

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:59,360
and not expect all the analytics

00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:02,880
uh visualizations to come from kibana

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,520
especially uh with post-facto changing

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,839
data become an issue

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,120
after the event has occurred since you

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:14,319
cannot join

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:17,760
indexes per say in elasticsearch and

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,799
that's where we looked at introducing

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,439
spark

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:26,720
to do some of the etl stuff so that um

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:29,760
like we need not um

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,960
like pull from elasticsearch always

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,200
so spark also started putting the data

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,120
in

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:41,039
micro batches into an s3 sync

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:43,520
and then presto could also read from

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,520
s3

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,480
so this is the more or less the tooling

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,000
part

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,720
and yeah aurora helped uh scale uh

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,600
but uh percona proved a much lower cost

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,960
alternative

00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:02,080
to other clusters

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,760
thanks alvik and then victor like you

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,679
had some pretty high

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,080
scalability targets you needed to meet

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,400
for the project down there

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,200
in mexico can you explain you know some

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,120
of what you did

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,720
i know you swapped out the database in

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,559
finraxion and

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,559
what did you do to help achieve that

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:26,480
yes because of the workload we have

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,880
replaced it postgres or mariadb which

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,320
was

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,760
the previous database using finner rcn

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:37,440
and we started to use tdb which is

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,720
a new sql database in order to

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,280
[Music]

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:46,320
handle the elastic transaction

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,720
that could happen during the online and

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,240
also to

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:55,280
to handle the workload expected

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:58,400
because the number of accounts

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,679
this is in one side i mean only the loan

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,520
accounts but

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,880
also the customers the information

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,799
related to the customer

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:11,919
is important to keep for the

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,520
information or they required by another

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,919
institution that have

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:22,320
contracts with the with the bank so then

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:25,039
we have replaced this this database

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,640
and it right now is is working as

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,679
expected

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:33,280
on the other hand also all our

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:37,520
development has been used in containers

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:40,880
docker is our container engine

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,880
and we are using

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:48,000
kubernetes for the docker

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:51,360
orchestration this are our

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,039
tooling for handling the scalability

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:57,360
requested by the by the customer

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,720
and also on the other hand we have

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:03,679
replaced

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,679
the web servers for

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:11,919
instead of nginx we are replacing the

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:15,840
open light speed which allows

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:20,240
under the http version 3

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:22,400
protocol so this allowed us to

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,000
to have more concurrent connection for

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,320
the web

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,320
page for the customer

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,120
and also when we have done enhancement

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,559
in the accounting

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:43,760
on most of the cases are

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:48,720
for the cash-based accounting

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:53,039
and on the other hand also we have

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:56,880
in case of the batch processes because

00:20:53,039 --> 00:21:01,679
the the need of running

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:04,880
the calculation for the interest

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:09,200
cannot be run in a single machine

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:12,320
we are running in different clusters

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:15,440
so we have basically quarks

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:18,240
using gdbc store

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,280
instead of ram store this is for the

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,280
finite cm part

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,559
okay thank you victor and then i'm gonna

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,240
you know pivot to

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,320
the question that alex had as i think

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,120
it'll be a nice point of segway

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,280
into talking more about the roadmap and

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,600
you know collective items that

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,360
the partner community can collaborate on

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,000
that can go into upstream

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,280
so alex brought up the question around

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,440
you know what are

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,120
some of those performance benchmarks in

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,000
terms of tps that had to

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,880
to meet so for your you know customers

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,640
can you

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,080
explain some of the benchmarks you were

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,760
expected to meet

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,280
and like what you ended up achieving

00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,559
because i know from the perspective of

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,880
the mephos community

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,880
you know we've seen interest from like

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,640
telcos and fintechs and they're like oh

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,120
you know can you support 1000

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,159
2000 tps i think one large fintech was

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,799
even seeking

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,080
you know three to five thousand tps and

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,600
so at a community level

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,679
if we could have you know more like

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,840
recent performance benchmarking tests

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,679
done

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,039
to what's there as part of the open

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,960
source i think that would help the

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,120
broader community be able to

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,720
get thinner act more more widely adopted

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,000
so we'd like to learn

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:35,200
what targets you had to achieve

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,280
okay we will wear this performance

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:42,960
information as soon as we get the

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:46,960
the results but this would be

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:50,240
a good reference for all the

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:55,840
community and the people interested

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,840
to use similar use cases

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,200
and then it's fun what specific metrics

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,760
did you need to achieve and i think one

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,799
you know good item for the roadmap would

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,960
be at least to just

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:13,200
publish you know what are these typical

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,520
metrics and expectations that come up

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,640
from you know these prospective

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,120
customers looking at

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,640
finrac and then ideally you know we can

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,720
establish a goal

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,640
at a community level to try to achieve

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,400
some you know minimum

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,559
target metric there but at least being

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,240
aware of what the target metrics are and

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,760
what we should be measuring

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:37,360
would be ideal as a starting point yep

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,520
i have i have two which which

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,799
probably makes a lot of sense one of

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,240
them as i mentioned

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:46,080
around this batch processing that

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,840
what's the number of loan accounts that

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,320
you could comfortably

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,320
manage in an end of the process let's

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,600
see in an hour

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:59,039
and he i

00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:01,840
don't have the numbers at hand but

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,679
as far as i remember so the target was

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,799
let's say like

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,240
000 accounts to be closed in an hour

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,720
time window

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,520
and that is like not straightforward to

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,919
achieve

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:18,640
uh with the with it so that's one

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,320
metrics that could be used and another

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,080
metrics the opposite the

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:27,200
opening of these loan accounts um

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,919
if you take that use case

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,320
that on a black friday you keep shopping

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,440
and customers wants to use

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,640
this type of loans for their shopping

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,200
then you could end up with really peak

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,880
loan account creations now there are

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,159
multiple ideas here

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:50,559
that that how you can

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:52,640
kind of create um or reduce this peak

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,760
but ultimately that could be like

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,240
another

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,279
measure that that how many accounts

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,320
could you open

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,919
in a given timeline i don't have the

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,480
numbers here that what

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,520
but but it's definitely on the thousands

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,799
scale

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,880
uh per minute let's say that

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,720
that you should expect from the system

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,240
to be able to handle

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,919
and then obviously there's a real-time

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,840
transaction scenario

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,440
uh and we all know that these peaks

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,279
could come in especially if someone

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,640
bombards the system with a

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:26,240
huge batch uh and then it's flood

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,919
floods the system with real-time

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,200
transactions that could be another

00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,480
factor

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:35,919
that we can consider as a performance

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,360
something that we measure vanavik i'll

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,600
let you quickly respond

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,120
and then i'll go through a couple of the

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,840
sort of items we've been proposing on

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,720
the road map

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:47,760
and get some responses as we're coming

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:51,120
into about five to six minutes left

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,159
right so i don't think there's an easy

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,039
answer to which

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,720
metrics because uh what we are using in

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,760
production is uh like

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,520
some commercial tools like uh like nginx

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,720
plus and new relic

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:08,480
and we would like want almost

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,880
similar set subset of those metrics

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,240
and not narrow it down to one or two

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,400
metric

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,400
and yeah

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,240
okay thanks avec and then yeah michael

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,360
oh sorry go on

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,200
so what we could do but but some of

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,480
these metrics what we could list

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,240
and create as part of our integration

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,640
test some kind of measurements

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,960
so that on a given platform that where

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,880
we are and we could always say that

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:44,320
okay our our baseline is 50 something on

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:47,039
6 cpu and this database and then

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,960
as the code gets modified at least we

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,840
make sure that we try to improve

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,120
on some of these metrics and yeah i

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,039
listed a couple

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,919
and probably could come up with a list

00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:00,000
of 10 that what makes a lot of sense

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,360
like another use case could be that if

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,640
you use your

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:07,760
system as a wallet and you have

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,880
cards associated with the urbanites

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,880
then again comes this christmas shopping

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,559
black friday shopping and all these

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,679
nightmares uh which

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,440
could gives us another important input

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,559
that what transactions

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,559
could we look for

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,799
okay and then a little while back on the

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,200
list you know michael helped to propose

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,840
you know what some of these areas of

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,480
tools that

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,600
are replicable that could be focused on

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,200
and what are some of the shared

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,200
resources the

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,880
community could collaborate on so ishvan

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,000
i know when we were planning for this we

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,000
talked about

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,840
some of like the the tooling that could

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,679
be utilized so just trying to recommend

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,480
and standardize around some of the tools

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,240
like

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,520
from atheists and grafana so i think

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,679
that was one point

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,559
we wanted to move forward and then we

00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,279
also brought up

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,159
you know how it'd be better to expose

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,000
you know the proper

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,200
endpoints for capturing more of these

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,799
business level metrics

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,559
so can you talk a little bit about what

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,120
we discussed there yeah

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,120
and so

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,799
so again two aspects so how we collect

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:15,520
and what actually we are collecting

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,279
uh on these informations and probably

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,279
the other aspect that if we want to

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,480
drive the system that what tools we are

00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,039
using to drive it

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,840
so there's there's a whole bunch of

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,720
tools from

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,760
geometer and at least that's an apache

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,240
project

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,760
uh being on the apache conference but

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,559
from gatling

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,880
or or if we go a bit further on the

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,440
behavior driven development side

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,159
that we use that successfully to drive

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,960
this

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,159
test uh that that you define business

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,720
scenarios in an

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,360
in a business language let's say and

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,919
then you

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,279
could drive the system with this

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,480
information via the

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,760
apis what is exposed and so coming to

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,039
the other side

00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:02,320
collecting the information what we have

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:04,799
done recently

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,840
related to the payment of implementation

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:09,279
that we used

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:12,480
prometheus and graphene to expose

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:15,360
many of the metrics and including

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,200
business type of metrics that how many

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,880
transactions take place or what's the

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,039
volume of the transactions

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,320
what's going through and then you could

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,559
have some real time

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,720
inside that what's going on the system

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,919
and another good set of tools

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:34,260
is the elastic stack

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:35,360
and kibana that

00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:39,760
[Music]

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,360
sorry so the elastic stack and then keep

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,520
an eye which could also give another

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,919
type of insight on the traffic

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,559
uh what's going through and again

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,720
driving

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,840
or creating dashboards before that

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,880
information

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,279
could make a lot of sense thanks this

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,159
one

00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:58,080
and then another resource that michael

00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,760
proposed was more around you know having

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,840
some of these data sets and having some

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,399
of these scripts to actually do

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,240
the performance testing is that you know

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,440
a good area where

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,600
partners could come together and

00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,880
collaborate in the commons and

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,559
do you have you know testing scripts or

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:23,840
data sets that could be shared back with

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:23,840
the community to achieve the same

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,279
sorry ed are you asking me yeah you are

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,720
of it because i know you know for having

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,520
to do these tests like for your

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,279
customers

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,200
yeah is this like a resource that you'd

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,720
be able to to share back

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,120
with the community because i think this

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,600
we we'd identified this as a good

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,120
part of like the set of common resources

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,880
in the middle that

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,120
it could be there available for others

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,720
to use and do these tests on their own

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,720
and whatnot

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:56,559
um yeah go ahead god

00:30:52,720 --> 00:31:00,159
and we have a bunch of geometer tests

00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:03,600
uh for for testing loan collections

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:05,120
in uh and accrual and uh

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,880
triggering across and monitoring the

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,320
metrics so those

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,559
tests we can share um and i guess

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,600
we have something for origination as

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,840
well

00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,799
uh so yeah those jmeter scripts you can

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,279
share

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:23,039
they will become another asset to

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:26,159
maintain though on top of the

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:29,279
existing api documentation in html

00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:32,559
over swagger then the

00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:35,840
integration test suit so

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:38,880
yeah and

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:41,919
one tool what we have used

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,080
is the cucumber stack

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,000
for behavior driven development it's not

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,480
for performance but then

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,440
but then you could actually execute them

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,559
parallel

00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,640
but it it is i would say very customer

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:57,039
specific because with these tools

00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,960
you need to implement kind of a language

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,200
that you agree with the business of how

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,399
they use this so that's probably

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,120
hard and it's also kind of complicated

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,360
to

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,200
to maintain but the other one which

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,440
makes a lot of sense and

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,840
again we mentioned this probably

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,600
yesterday

00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,600
using um um what

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:24,559
postman postman collections um similarly

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,159
to geometer just a different tool

00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:30,480
that we capture some of the

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,760
like an account open process or a whole

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,480
complete set of

00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,600
transactions in a sequence and then you

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,120
can run them

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,240
uh some kind of tool to measure the

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,159
performance of the system

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,440
i'm thinking that is there anything in

00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,000
which which is

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,919
which is which could be generally can be

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,200
part of the integration test uh

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:56,960
platform um we we need to look for

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,720
look for this

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,720
okay no thank you and i think we're

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,279
getting to the end of our session

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,720
and we need to start channeling people

00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,360
over to the next one but to sort of

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,279
recap

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,080
you know we discussed as part of this

00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,519
road map trying to define and identify

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,120
you know what some of those metrics are

00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,559
and targets we need to achieve as

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,039
michael noted you know we really want to

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,440
focus

00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,960
first off on having more that testing

00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,080
infrastructure then we can think about

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,320
the actual

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,600
monitoring tools and then you know

00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,240
lastly once we know what those

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,720
bottlenecks

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,320
are you know actually have tickets to do

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,880
the proper tuning and indexing and

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,640
whatnot

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,399
you know changes at the code level to

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,480
achieve the scalability

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,840
so you know michael took notes here

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,600
we're going to try to translate these

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,519
into tickets in jira

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,840
and actual items for people to pick up

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,679
and then mifos is helping to guide

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,880
like a scalability working group as well

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,360
to just give you know

00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,120
individuals a place to communicate and

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,919
have regular meetings to track these

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,440
items

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,360
so we really welcome others in the

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,159
community to join these efforts going

00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,640
forward

00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,880
as finrac and finraxian continue to get

00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,480
adopted by larger and larger

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,320
institutions and we want to you know

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,960
make sure it's world-class

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,640
and individual partners and companies

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,840
don't need to invest all their effort in

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,599
achieving scale

00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,839
when we can do it collectively as a

00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,320
community but want to thank michael for

00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:16,879
taking notes and thank ishvan

00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,320
victor and avec for being on the panel

00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,480
and hopefully you know if they're more

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,560
discussion take it to the birds of

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,520
feather session at the end of the track

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,599
today

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,879
and then next up we've got a panel on

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,480
openg2p

00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,040
which is also about you know achieving

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,280
scale in the form of digitizing

00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,800
large scale cash transfers at the

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,839
government level and hope you all can

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,839
attend that

00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,040
and i'll see you over there momentarily

00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,800
thank you everyone

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:49,839
thank you thank you ed thank you

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:49,839
everyone everyone

00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,159
