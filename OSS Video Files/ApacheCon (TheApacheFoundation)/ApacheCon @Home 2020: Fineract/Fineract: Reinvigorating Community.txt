	Fineract: Reinvigorating Community
Michael Vorburger

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

The Apache Fineract community has seen a marked uptake in new activity in PRs and on the dev mailing list. This talk will present some of the measures that we have taken which enabled this. It will use the Apache Fineract project as an example, but the shared lessons learnt will be generally applicable.

Michael is a long time open sourcerer who over the years has been involved in too many projects to enumerate. He started in FLOSS one fateful night many moons ago through a friendly interaction with a maintainer on an IRC channel of what was then the Mifos project. Ever since, he has been actively supporting the humanitarian open source platform for financial inclusion that is now known as Apache Fineract in a volunteer capacity. Currently employed by Google, previously at Red Hat, this talk is given in a purely personal capacity.
