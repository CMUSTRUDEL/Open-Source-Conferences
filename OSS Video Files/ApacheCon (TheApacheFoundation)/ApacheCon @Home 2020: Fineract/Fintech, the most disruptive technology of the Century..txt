The 4th Industrial Revolution, technology has made us jump light-years in terms of well-being, human capacity, knowledge, equality, and social inclusion. The change has been so big, so profound and so fast, that not everybody has been available to experience it, and not every industry could be adaptable and innovative enough to survive this change. The power of Technology used for good, and all the benefits it can provide, has not only changed our ways of living, but also our ways of thinking, bringing financial inclusion (a key pillar in social inclusion) to places never think of thanks to mobile and electronic money. Technology and innovation applied to Finance with Financial Inclusion as its mission and vision, took out of poverty millions of people; giving them access not only to financial services, but also to education, safety and equality. In addition, half of the world’s population is under 30: all background people born and raced in the eye of the storm. A generation that knows and wants to change the world, that claims for more rights, benefits and comfort. A generation becoming, if not already become, the economic machine to move our financial and banking system. A System with more than 200 years, reluctant to adapt this new Era, will have what it takes to provide ethical, innovative, equally, useful, and human centered financial services? Fintechs have already started and succeeding.

I’m a young, committed woman, always caring for others, and thinking of the next steps on how to solve financial inclusion problems. I am the Vice President of Market Entry at Kuelap, Inc. In where my team calls me ‘a force of nature’, since I am convinced that as part of my generation everybody should be a change agent, improving the state of the world, and doing the little things today that will have an incredible impact tomorrow. I am a problem-solution driven person. Always searching for a way to improve and find a solution to any given problem. I am highly committed to Social Inclusion, and work to fulfill that vision bringing Financial Inclusion to people all over the world. Before Kuelap, I worked at the Mifos Initiative; where I was the Account Manager. The Mifos Initiative is a non-profit open-source and free software project, with a presence in 37 countries, with more than 500 Finance Institutions using the software and reaching over 6 million final users. I have worked for and committed to projects that promote Social Inclusion as a volunteer for the past decade. As a former Law student, I was involved in projects that included the coordination of legal assistance of the largest free clinic of Uruguay; project deployed by the Student’s Centre of Law School at the Universidad de la República. Since 2013, I am a Global Shaper, an initiative of the World Economic Forum, which gathers young leaders to create a high impact on social projects. In 2014, I decided to bring my experience, knowledge, and enthusiasm on Social Inclusion to my professional life and started to work on Financial Inclusion, as a key pillar to overcome poverty around the world. In that regard, I co-founded $ERO, an Electronic Bank for the Base of the Pyramid in Uruguay, which was the first Latin-America startup in obtaining a Central Bank’s banking license.

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,880
way back

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,399
since thanks to him i actually started

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,000
in this business

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,000
um so i am very honored to be part of

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,720
apachecon is my first time

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,560
so it is such an honor for me and also

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,520
for quail at my company

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,159
um so as javier was saying i'm going to

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,640
talk about

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,200
fintech and why for me is the most

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,200
disruptive technology of the century

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,240
and probably this is going to be a

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,439
session

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,440
that um is not going to be like the ones

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,120
that you've been hearing before

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,360
uh since i don't have a much technical

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,040
background you're not going to listen to

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,239
me talking too much about

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,840
you know um hard technology but

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,959
more of a business point of view around

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,080
this

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,080
so um

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,000
i just wanted to start by saying that we

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,959
have to

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,400
bear in mind that there's only one

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,040
future that i think that

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,680
we all should be interested in and i'm

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,680
definitely

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,440
interested in and it's one where

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,480
financial services

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,640
meaningfully improve people's lives

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,720
in this talk we'll go on a journey

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,879
together to explore this future

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,480
and i want to share with you a path from

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,280
where we are today

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,120
to a world where your ideas are realized

00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,680
and improve the lives of the people you

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,440
serve

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,440
so let's get started

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,720
so if you are here probably you have

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,000
some clue about what fintech is

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,280
but uh i'm going to give you some

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,599
um notes on that and probably you know

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,239
that financial technology or fintech

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,440
is used to describe a new tech that

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,680
seeks to improve and

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,280
automate the delivery and use of

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,000
financial services

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,799
at its core fintech is utilized to help

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,519
companies

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,440
business owners and consumers better

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,920
manage their financial operations

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,280
processes and lives by utilizing

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,000
specialized software

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,080
and algorithms that are used on computer

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,480
and smartphones

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,519
when fintech as we know it emerged in

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,200
the 21st century the term was initially

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,720
initially sorry applied to the

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,599
technology employed

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,439
at the backend systems of established

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,920
financial institutions

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,560
since then however there has been a

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,879
swift

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,840
a shift to more consumer-oriented

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,640
services

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,920
and therefore a more consumer-oriented

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,920
definition

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,920
fintech now includes different sectors

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,000
and industries such as education

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,040
retail banking fundraising and

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,320
non-profit and

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,959
investment and management to a new to

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,959
name a few

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,560
so sorry it's just that being with the

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,360
two screens a little bit complicated

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,560
so as i was saying fintech as we know it

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,000
emerged

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,320
um in the early stages of the 21st

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,919
century but what is very interesting is

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,880
that actually fintech

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,000
without that name started around 70

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,240
years ago

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,600
and what is striking is that about the

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,320
last 70 years

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,880
of development in these technologies is

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,440
that while

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,199
they became mainstream and widely used

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,160
by banks and their customers

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,800
the banking sector wasn't threatened at

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,840
all

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,800
on the contrary during these stages

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,800
banks grew

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,000
the most talked about and most funded

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,800
fintech

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,680
startups share the same characteristic

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,639
they are designed to be a threat to

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,680
a threat to and challenge and eventually

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,360
observe

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,800
entrenched traditional financial

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,360
services providers

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,080
by being more nimble serving an

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,039
underserved segment or providing faster

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,759
and or better services so fintech is a

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,840
different

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,160
is different than many other startup

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,360
sectors because the financial world

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,000
is heavily regulated and mostly consists

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,880
of a relatively few number of large

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,520
well-established firms if one word can

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,360
describe

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,440
how many fintech's innovations have

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,440
affected traditional trade in banking

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,840
financial advice and products

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,000
it's this disruption like financial

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,759
products and services that were once the

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,400
realm of branches

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,840
salesmen and desktops moved toward

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,039
mobile devices

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:07,840
or simply democratized away from large

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,840
entrenched institutions

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,479
and here's the key to everything

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,319
technology and innovation

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,840
applied to finance with financial

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,039
inclusion as its mission

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,520
and vision took millions out of poverty

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,840
giving them access not only to financial

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,960
services but also to education

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,120
safety and equality being able to have

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,120
access to a transaction account is a

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,000
first step toward broader financial

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,000
inclusion

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,759
since a transaction account allows

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,319
people to store money

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,520
and send and receive payments a

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,919
transaction account

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,800
serves as a gateway to other financial

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,720
services

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,400
which is why ensuring that people

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,759
worldwide can have access to a

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,639
transaction account

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,800
is most important as business and

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,120
technology innovators we have not only

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,840
the opportunity but the responsibility

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,960
to create

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,840
and deliver solutions to whom needed the

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,840
most

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,160
so where are we standing with all of

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,319
this

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,319
back in the early 80s nobel laureate

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,840
muhammad yunus was the pioneer in

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,080
creating a new mindset

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,840
and business culture within the banking

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,599
and financial industry

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,759
financial inclusion and social

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,680
businesses towards the world of cedar

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,400
poverty by 2030.

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,880
so let's see how this has developed

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,759
first

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,080
we find microfinance and here is where

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,160
all

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,479
started professor yunus founded the

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,800
grameen bank on the principle that loans

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,000
are

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,759
better than charity to interrupt poverty

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,400
they offer people the opportunity to

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,520
take initiatives in business or africa

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:49,520
agriculture with which provide earnings

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,919
and enable them to pay off the debt

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,000
the bank is founded on the belief that

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,840
people have endless potential

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,120
and unleashing their creativity and

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,919
initiative

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,919
helps them end poverty grameen has

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,680
offered credit to classes of people

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,800
formerly underserved

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,759
the poor woman illiterate and unemployed

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,560
people

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,280
access to credit is based on reasonable

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,199
terms

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,720
such as the group leading system and

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,000
weekly installment payments

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,919
with reasonable long-term of loans

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,440
enabling the poor to build on their

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,400
existing skills

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,680
to earn better income in each cycle of

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,680
loans

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,240
given the opportunity and access the

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,360
impact and results on people's lives

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:37,039
is radical but credit is not

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,080
merely enough so there comes financial

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,000
inclusion

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,240
and if we talk about inclusion for the

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,519
unserved and the answer

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,440
microcredit again is not nearly enough

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,080
the world bank had defined financial

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,200
inclusion as the means that individuals

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,839
and businesses

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,000
have access to useful and affordable

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,720
financial products and services

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,440
that meet their needs transactions

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,480
payments

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:06,839
savings credit and insurance delivered

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,839
in a responsible ethical and sustainable

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,839
way

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,440
and then now we have this main goal of

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,680
no poverty by 2030.

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,959
technology has made us jump light years

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,440
in terms of well-being

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,040
human capacity and knowledge equality

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,160
and social inclusion

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,800
the change has been so big so profound

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,399
and so fast that not everybody has been

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,320
able to experience it

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,399
and not every industry could be

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,000
adaptable and innovative enough to

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,480
survive this change

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,279
the 2030 agenda for sustainable

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,320
development

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,880
adopted by all united nations member

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,600
estates in 2015 provides a shared

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,399
blueprint

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,839
for peace and prosperity for people and

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,200
the planet

00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:00,000
now and into the future at its heart are

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,320
the 17 sustainable development goals

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,200
which are an urgent call for action by

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,440
all countries

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,480
developed and developing in a global

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,959
partnership

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,160
they recognize that ending poverty and

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,560
other deprivations

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,360
must go hand in hand with the strategies

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,160
that improve

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,720
health and education reducing equality

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,519
and

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,360
spur economic growth all while tackling

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,600
climate change and working to preserve

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,160
our oceans and forests

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,320
the power of technology used for good

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,360
and all the benefits it can provide has

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,720
not only changed

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,279
our ways of living but also our ways of

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,440
thinking

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,360
bringing financial inclusion a key

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,399
pillar in social inclusion

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,920
to unimaginable heights thanks to mobile

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,880
and digital financial inclusion is a key

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,800
enabler

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,160
to reducing poverty and boosting

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,800
property

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,480
prosperity story so i am sure that right

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,279
now you're wondering okay so

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,440
where is she going with all of this so

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,079
all of this i believe that set up the

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,880
stage

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,720
to understand exactly what it is that

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,519
responsibility that i was talking about

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,760
before

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,560
and what we can do as business

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,600
innovators

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,760
and as technology innovators and

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,959
right now since we are hearing apache

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,320
con and knowing

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:19,040
how important it is the apache um

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,320
foundation is actually wondering okay so

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,399
what can i do

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:28,240
with all of this so let's take a look

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:30,079
at this if we see fintech and actually

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,720
this is from the business insider global

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,480
fintech

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,120
ecosystem for 2020 we can see that

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,279
fintech

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,360
it is a mess or at least it's difficult

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,760
to understand

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,279
it's a crowded landscape focused almost

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,839
entirely on upper

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,959
income people in upper income countries

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,040
for newcomers

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,000
it's hard to differentiate and establish

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,399
a foothold

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,040
even worse with the focus in the united

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,680
states

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,800
and in their european markets is not

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,760
even a level playing

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,680
field for innovators in these markets

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,480
the customer accounts are controlled by

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,639
the

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,000
big banks the payment networks are

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,200
controlled by the

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
big banks and the regulators are more or

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,800
less controlled by the big banks too

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,200
fintech has been so busy chasing

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:21,279
unicorns that we have missed the market

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,680
right in front of us their real impact

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,279
and that doesn't seem like a very

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,320
compelling future

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,480
but i am very optimistic so

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,760
let me tell you that actually there is a

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,000
very compelling

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,040
future and the mckinsey global institute

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
has actually

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,399
measured it there are 11 trillion

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,600
dollars of financial activity

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,440
untapped banks or fintech consisting in

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,639
a consumer marketplace

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,160
of three to four billion people so what

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,440
is going on with this market

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,160
why is nobody um tackling this model

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,600
this market

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,600
and where is this market

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:04,320
this market is actually in the

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,079
developed economies technology has

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,240
created new opportunities for digital

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,519
financial services to accelerate

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,399
and enhance financial inclusion digital

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,560
finance is

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,399
increasing financial inclusion and is

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,200
associated with higher gdp

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,160
growth the revolution in financial

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,720
services the

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,160
delivery is well underway we are

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,320
arriving in a new era

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,279
moving from a time where people almost

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,160
universally

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,399
dislike the inconvenience cost and

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,440
slowness of financial services

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,000
to a time where these are as easy low

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,240
cost

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,839
and fast to use as apps or smartphones

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,639
financial institutions and services

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,600
providers can finally participate in an

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,079
efficient and

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,639
cost effective manner we can put the

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,160
preferences and needs of our customers

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,000
into better focus

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,320
while growing the market to include

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,079
people who depend on and need more

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,680
affordable transactions

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:03,760
and this market is global more than half

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,360
the adults in the world are waiting for

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,519
fintech solutions

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,519
so what is it going to take

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,440
facing a changed world and radically new

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,959
market dynamics created by the internet

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,839
and the digital transformation of

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,800
economies

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,519
transactions mobile access and of money

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,760
itself

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,040
every new and surviving financial

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,760
services business

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,399
is looking for strategies to adapt

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,760
connect

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,600
and grow all world assets such as

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,600
locked-in customer-based financial

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,920
resources enclosed by fortress-like

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,160
walls of high transactions costs

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,120
and a molasses slow timeline of service

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,560
improvements

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,959
have become liabilities fintech startups

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,760
financial institutions and markets

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,079
teaming with old and new customers alike

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,120
are all in this disconcerting situation

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,000
together

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,920
as a result most banks and credit unions

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,120
especially a small and medium financial

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,399
organizations

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,000
require assistance in the transition

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:13,760
from the legacy system

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:16,720
to future technology solutions

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,160
what we need is a highly efficient way

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,560
of transacting

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,240
creating efficiencies is important but

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,560
alone is inadequate

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,760
and leads only to the incremental

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,720
innovations like

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,000
atm machines and addresses only a small

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,199
part of our

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,320
challenge we need a highly efficient way

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,360
of transacting

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,160
and a fast easy network with clear

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,440
and standard ways for those transactions

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,240
to work at much

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,480
lower cost so they can scale and be

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,199
offered to more people

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,079
sever service providers and institutions

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,959
can't design

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,160
products based on standards that improve

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,480
efficiencies

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,199
and offer services and innovative

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:04,240
products at a lower cost to customers

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:04,240
while making while making better profits

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,959
the real purpose of open source is to

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,600
develop

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,399
standards that drive the delivery of

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,680
services

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:20,160
at a massive scale software companies

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,120
industry groups and regulators

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,600
collaborate

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,560
on open source projects to develop and

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,000
enhance

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,839
these global standards as you may know

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,440
the most important global software

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,160
standards are governed

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,759
by guest who yeah the apache software

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,720
foundation and the linux

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,320
foundation who provide fair and neutral

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,720
governance

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,839
we have to embrace what's out there

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,000
nobody builds

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,040
anything from the ground up anymore

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,920
instead

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,720
you manically obsessively passionately

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,839
focus

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,839
on your value to add your customers and

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,959
on getting to market first

00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,279
by only building what we need only when

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,000
we

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,360
need it and you do that by leveraging

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,919
the value add

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,679
and the services of others who are

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,559
passionately focused

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,160
on you as their customers you have to

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,720
understand that once you

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,400
enter the fintech world it's just not

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,240
another software project

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,760
it's just not looking for the next

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,160
unicorn you have to understand the

00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,120
responsibility that

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,799
we all have and we need to create this

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,000
add value this social

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:33,840
impact the real innovation now

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,840
more than ever

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:46,000
so imagine this someone somewhere remote

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,559
in a low income country in the early

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,280
hours

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,200
of the morning a woman wakes up and

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,840
dials her cell phone

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,400
he's borrowing a very small amount of

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,400
money digitally to buy some vegetables

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,960
in the local market

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,559
during the day she will sell her

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,600
inventory in her shop

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:08,240
located in the outskirts of the town

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,360
some customers will pay her using their

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,720
mobile wallet

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,600
others with cash she will transfer the

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,080
cash

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,440
onto her phone at the shop next door

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,400
where the merchant

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,280
is also a mobile money agent at the end

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,160
of the day

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,520
she will be able to pay back her loan

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,720
and keep her profit

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,360
in her mobile wallet she can use this

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,480
mobile money to pay for the gas he uses

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,799
to cook dinner

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,600
as the utility company has recently

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,000
connected

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,280
its payment systems to the mobile money

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,559
infrastructure

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:45,600
in your daily life this is huge

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,160
progress and technology like the one

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,960
that is curated by the apache software

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,320
foundation

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:57,840
and finra itself is what actually has

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,840
brought this huge impact thank you

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,720
hey lisa thank you for your presentation

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,600
i don't know if there is any

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,240
question from the audience uh if anyone

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,559
wants to

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,559
ask any questions if not i

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,039
i would like to ask you one thing about

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,400
the fintech

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:47,520
and and is why do you think that

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,720
that that fintech it's

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:53,120
it's it's been so powerful in the last

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,039
years and what what are the trends that

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,160
are you seeing

00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:00,880
in the in the fintech space today

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,880
or these days

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,240
i think that the main fintechs well

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:10,559
first of all um

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:13,200
to answer that question again um in my

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,159
every day when i'm working when i am in

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,200
the field

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,159
what i'm always seeing is how fintech is

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,520
making a social

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,240
impact so in these kind of spaces where

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,360
we work

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,320
you are not going to find um ai

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,000
or machine learning or technology like

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,880
that or cryptocurrency

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,799
you are going to find um new innovations

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,960
and actually ways to

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,000
maybe solve problems the same old

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,240
problems but

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,360
with new methodologies or with new

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,840
techniques

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,720
so the main trends on that space that i

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,000
am seeing

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:51,039
is um providing for with

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
more transactional accounts to people

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:55,520
especially to the underserved uh people

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,840
because we have to make

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,120
um a difference between the people that

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,000
is unserved

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,480
and the people that is underserved

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,280
generally in the emerging economies we

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,960
can find

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:12,159
that we have a very large

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,960
percentage of people that is served by

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,360
banks or by any financial institution

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,039
but then we see that these people are

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,840
not using their accounts for many

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,760
reasons

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,280
if it is because it is too costly

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,799
because it is too difficult because they

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,559
don't have the connectivity or

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,919
basically because they just don't know

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,880
how to manage that

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,080
so all of that people that it seems that

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,559
they are actually

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,840
included actually they are not and they

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,440
are underserved

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,120
so one of the main trends that i am

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,280
seeing out there is

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,240
all these technologies or all these

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,159
startups that are trying to serve

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,320
that people that it is underserved

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,000
especially by providing with

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,039
transactional accounts

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,679
to make sure that when people um have an

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,840
account in any financial co-op

00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,240
or if they have yeah especially when

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,480
they have in a financial co-op or if

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,520
even if they're receiving money from the

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,600
government as

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,440
social security or something like that

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,320
that they actually know how to use that

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,640
instrument

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,960
and that they can do transactions with

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,080
that account i think that is the main

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,720
trend that we have right now

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,919
so you you don't just you're not

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,840
focusing on

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:28,640
on just big innovations and

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:32,159
and new technology wave it's just

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,000
allowing the the unbound to do

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,280
things that the first world and the

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,840
people that is included

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,559
normally do and they are not not so

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,960
normal for

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,960
for the people that is like living with

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,159
two dollars a day

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:50,240
exactly and that's where uh

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:53,360
the the the um the most people

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,840
that is unserved or underserved is

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,960
so um like for example i'm sure that

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,000
everybody that is in

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,720
this session and even i if i go

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,640
and grab my wallet like how many cards

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,320
do we have especially here in uruguay

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,720
that basically you go to the supermarket

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,880
and you get a debit card from any bank

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,120
or um and all those cards are

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,559
international debit cards so therefore

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,080
you can link that

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:20,720
um to any wallet so

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,280
mobile wallet maybe i have five six

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,080
different

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,520
accounts for mobile wallet and of course

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,760
because of my

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,919
background and where i live and for what

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,559
i do for a living actually

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,039
i know how to use all of that but then

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,120
you go

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,320
to these emerging economies that of

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,720
course are not

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,720
nothing like uruguay like you go to

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,600
southeast asia or you go to central

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,000
africa

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,880
and also to many parts of latin america

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,679
and you find

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,360
um all these people that they might have

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,240
an account but they just don't know how

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,480
to use it

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,000
or that maybe they don't even know that

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,799
they have the chance

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,760
or the opportunity to open an account

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,080
everywhere

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,000
so um i think that we really need to

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,240
make the difference between what is

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,760
going on and what is disruptive

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,559
in an emerging economy um region

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,279
versus what happens in a developed

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,000
country

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,799
because the innovations that people who

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,360
live

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,000
under our more or less similar

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,360
conditions

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,760
or in our privileges um yeah what we

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,240
want

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,120
is like i don't know that that only by

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,600
thinking

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,120
i can get my things paid and that is

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,320
something that is disruptive for us and

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,840
that we can use

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,799
but actually what uh we what people

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:39,200
in the other regions of the world who

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,840
really need a transactional account need

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,799
is actually transact is to be secure is

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,080
to learn

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:49,200
how to uh run their domestic finances

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,919
is how to say how to invest um

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,679
even get credit reports because many of

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,480
these people maybe they have informal

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,279
jobs

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,880
and they are very good payers but they

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,520
just don't have a credit record

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,320
so they will never get a loan or they

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,039
will never

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,559
even be able to open an account on any

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,679
financial institution

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,559
so i think that it's very different what

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,000
we can see

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:16,240
from um the us and europe

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,640
and other countries in the world versus

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,400
what we can see in emerging economies

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,640
so i really think that uh before

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,600
if we are working towards financial

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,679
inclusion

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,520
and if we are working in emerging

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,720
economies before we start

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:35,120
thinking what will be the next wheel

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,080
in fintech we need to understand what

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,120
the customers

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,600
need and how we can help them so they

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,720
can

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:46,080
have a better life

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,279
absolutely absolutely and you mentioned

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,480
and i know that you have a lot of

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:52,559
experience with the

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:55,440
cooperatives and and and create unions

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,679
how are they adopting new technologies

00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,960
and and what are the difficulties

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,960
for for this space to to adapt

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,279
fintech and and new emerging

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,279
technologies

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,880
that is a very very interesting question

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,880
and what is even more

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,480
interesting is that i think that uh

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,720
financial co-ops

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,200
and when i mean financial co-ops i mean

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,000
almost any financial institution that is

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,279
not a bank

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,960
or a retail bank um that they have many

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,279
names all around the world

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,120
so what is very um interesting about

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:30,480
these financial institutions

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:33,360
and more or less they all think alike or

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,880
they are very similar so basically first

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:39,039
and foremost their business

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:42,559
is very bank alike so what they do is

00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:45,120
sell and buy money basically um

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:47,279
and but the thing is that they are

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,480
running that business for people

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,120
that is not only wanting to buy or sell

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,960
their money

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,960
they need more because um well

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,559
we know that people have different needs

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,200
in different regions of the world

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,320
so the first thing that happens is that

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,840
um there's a

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,360
there's a this huge tsunami of

00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,240
regulations and new technologies as we

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,240
all know

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,400
um all around the world and these

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,480
financial institutions who maybe

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,720
five years ago or even less weren't

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,120
regulated now they are regulated

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,760
so now they just cannot run their entire

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,799
business

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,159
in an excel spreadsheet if you're lucky

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,159
to find one of those

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,760
or even running by paper they will need

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,279
to have a core banking system and they

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,080
will need to have that core banking

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,360
system

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,120
that is able to um have reports and

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,440
those reports need to go to their

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:40,720
central banks or any regulator

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,360
um and even though

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,159
at the very surface these financial

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,000
institutions

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,600
understand that they need that kind of

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,520
technology which for

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,440
us maybe it is like completely basic

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,840
having a core banking system

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,120
um at the surface they really understand

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,159
that they need that

00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,799
but then on our side and i think that

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,919
i have discovered this thanks to all my

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,679
years in koalap

00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,799
um is that at first we believed actually

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,960
that it was just

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,720
a matter of providing for the technology

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,840
and if we give you the technology in a

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,640
sustainable way

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,279
then that's it you will have um your

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,440
system

00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,440
and then you can improve your your your

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,960
business and your member base and you

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,080
can have like all these

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,919
um new technologies and stuff but then

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,320
you realize that that is not the right

00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,360
way

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,480
you actually need to help this financial

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,720
institutions

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,399
to get or to go through a digital

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,200
transformation process

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,840
because um most of the times again you

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,399
will find

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,240
maybe a financial institution who has a

00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,360
legacy system who has a court banking

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,399
system from the 90s

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,320
or maybe the early 2000s but that is if

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:50,399
you are very lucky but if you're not

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,880
that lucky you're actually go to the

00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,640
real

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,640
field and working with the real people

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,279
who need it they'll be running their

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,039
entire

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,440
uh operations in an excellent

00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,200
spreadsheet again if you're lucky

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,960
otherwise they'll be doing it just by

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,440
paper so you need to take

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,559
that people from that mindset of being

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:11,440
paper based to move to a digital based

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,960
system and that means that you need to

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,840
change their entire

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,799
business because again these financial

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,600
institutions

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,240
are their entire business is based on

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,640
paper

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,480
and now you're taking them digitally so

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,039
it's just not having an app it's

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,200
just not having a platform or a core

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,279
banking system that enables them with

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,240
other technologies and to other

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,559
solutions

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,640
you really need to change the mindset

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:39,679
and that's where i think

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,559
that our responsibility as business

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,080
innovators and

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:47,279
and technological innovators uh lives

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,240
is that oh sorry is the bell and my jobs

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,279
are going to go

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:54,799
mental um

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:57,600
so um what we need to understand there

00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,159
is that our role there is not just

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,080
bringing

00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,279
the technology or delivering the

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,039
technology we

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,200
really need to grab these people by

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:07,279
their hand and and help them

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,039
walk through this process because

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,720
otherwise we are not going to be

00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:13,279
successful and you can spend

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,480
millions of dollars and you can spend

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,200
years and years

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,640
trying them to use a technology that

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,559
they are not ready for

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,159
because again we are talking about

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,520
financial institutions

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:28,000
not just people probably if you go

00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,320
to the field and you go even to a rural

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,360
area and you provide directly to the

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,880
consumer to

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,880
that final um user

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,799
a technological solution probably they

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,320
will um

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,559
use it faster than a financial

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,159
institution but a financial institution

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:47,360
is a completely

00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,720
different uh thing and you really need

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,640
to be aware of that

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:55,919
before you get um to work with them

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,640
but i have a so what why

00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,360
do you when this is an open question and

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,120
i don't have

00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,480
of course i don't have the answer it's

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,840
it's

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,640
what will you invest your your resources

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,679
and your time

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:12,880
is in trying to convince

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:15,039
people that they need to come

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,840
and digitize their process and

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:20,240
procedures and

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:22,960
business and like convince all

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,159
all the old school guys to come to the

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,440
new world

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:30,720
or you you support

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,480
the new fintechs in order that because

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,919
they don't they don't need to

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,919
so on one hand you have the the old

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,440
old school guys who has their clients

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,360
and the customers

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,880
and and and on the other hand you have

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,480
the fintechs that they have they have

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,519
the technology but they don't have the

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,720
customers

00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:50,640
so sometimes they are going to

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,640
meet in the middle some some fintechs

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,919
are going to get more customers and go

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:58,880
gain traction and some cooperatives and

00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,679
trade unions will die in the middle so

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,200
where are you

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:05,120
putting your energy to today and on

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,279
if this is a trade-off or this is

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:11,120
something that that can be

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:15,200
forever or someone is going to win

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,760
or no well that is a very interesting

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,279
question

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,200
and that is something that i think that

00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:23,360
all of us have been thinking

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,360
for many years now and

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,080
again of course i don't have the the

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:32,159
right answer maybe but what i do believe

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,919
is that um we are kind of living like

00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,279
in parallel worlds when you are in the

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,720
fintech industry

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:41,279
so you have like all the technology

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,799
you know that this is the best thing for

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:46,559
financial institutions

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:48,080
or for um the the end consumer

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,000
but of course they are not going to

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,000
believe that or is going to be very very

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,600
difficult for them to understand

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,720
so that is the world that the fintechs

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,279
are leaving then we have the other world

00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,440
which is

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,200
the real world or well not the real

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,480
world maybe the matrix

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,360
um and we are the real world um so

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,320
in this matrix like world what happens

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,840
is that

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,320
that is actually the reality that you

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,360
have to face and the financial industry

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,799
is not going to

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:20,080
go away from night to day i mean

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:23,039
in 1994 i think it was um bill gates

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,480
said that banking is necessary but banks

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:27,519
are not and

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,880
it's been almost oh my god almost

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:34,480
30 years 25 almost

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,519
since um he said that and we are still

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,600
advanced

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,919
and probably we are still going to have

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,720
banks what i think that we need to meet

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,960
in the middle

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,360
is that um yeah banks are not necessary

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,600
but

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,279
the other kind of financial institutions

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,240
i think they are

00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:54,320
and if we want to keep them alive as

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,480
fintechs we need to help them

00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,159
and why do we want to keep them alive i

00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,039
think that we want to keep them alive

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,080
again because of their social impact and

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,840
i think

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,240
um that um that is another thing that we

00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,520
need

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,760
need to answer to ask ourselves if if

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,919
that is what we really want so do we

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,960
want their the next unicorn or do we

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:16,879
actually

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,520
want to change the world do we want to

00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,480
actually make an impact to everything

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,359
that we do

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,679
that we wake up one day and we say okay

00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,639
this was worth it because i really make

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,679
a change

00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,079
so i think that the real change is right

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,000
there

00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,200
with these financial institutions who

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,280
are caring

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,720
for their communities who are actually

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,280
helping women

00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,399
in rural areas who are helping kids to

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,159
get educated

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:47,040
who are trying to people not um

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,159
work informally but actually have a

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,280
formal job

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:54,639
so i think that yeah banks probably

00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,879
will stop um will stop

00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,240
yeah existing at some point i don't

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,800
think it's going to be

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,000
anywhere soon and i think that field

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,720
fintechs alone

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,280
just cannot make it because fintech

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,079
people

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,240
are not bankers we all know that um and

00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,400
we don't get along with regulators and

00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,240
we don't understand regulators and we

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,119
don't understand why things have to be

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,920
so

00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,599
uh slow and while we cannot try things

00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,560
and if it doesn't work then we build

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,520
something else

00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,400
we are a completely different uh kind of

00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,079
people

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,599
so um but there's a reality principle i

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,000
think that we need to follow

00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,280
and understand that we just cannot at

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,480
least for now

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:39,119
uh like throw everything

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,720
um and and build something from scratch

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,960
i mean that will be

00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,800
the best thing i think but this is the

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,880
reality that we are facing

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,160
and especially living in the world that

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,599
we are living right now

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,960
in the middle of a pandemic um and with

00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,720
all the things that are

00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,760
happening uh politically everywhere

00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:02,800
um i think that now more than

00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,400
ever not only as business innovators and

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,079
technological innovators but

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,880
also as leaders in the fintech world we

00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,800
need to take a stand and say okay are we

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,640
going to really make an impact

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,480
and if we are going to make to make an

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,040
impact we need to decide to

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,000
whom we are going to create that impact

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,480
if it is

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,280
for the people who already have all the

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,760
privileges

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,200
that they can have or if we are actually

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,200
going to do something

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,880
and help these institutions who are

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,079
working with communities

00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:37,119
that are not that privileged

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,119
yeah right

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,640
thank you thank you for your

00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:53,119
presentation and your thoughts

00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:53,119
