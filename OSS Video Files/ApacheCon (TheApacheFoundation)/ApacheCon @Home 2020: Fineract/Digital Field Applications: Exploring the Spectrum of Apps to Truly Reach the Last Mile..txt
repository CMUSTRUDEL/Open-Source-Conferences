Description: 
	Digital Field Applications: Exploring the Spectrum of Apps to Truly Reach the Last Mile.
Avik Ganguly

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

From loan origination to loan collections, from e-commerce to remittances, from savings to billpay, there are a wide range of use cases and different types of field staff and agents that DFAs enable. The APIs in Fineract already power a broad variety of digital field applications but there are many more use cases we could enable. Avik Ganguly of Fynarfin will explore the spectrum of digital field applications, the requirements they entail and the roadmap we can advance in Fineract. Heâ€™ll illustrate the breadth of the Fineract APIs by presenting a case study on the agent banking solution his team has built on top of Fineract.

Avik Ganguly is the founder of Fynarfin, a fintech company building scalable enterprise solutions on top of Apache Fineract. Avik is a Fintech specialist and open source evangelist who picked up his trade while working with Mifos, Conflux and Novopay.

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,480
origination to long collections

from e-commerce to remittances from

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,120

there are a wide range a wide range of

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,479
use cases

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,439
and different types of field staff and

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,560
agents at

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,479
efs enable the apis in finrac already

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,400
power a broad variety of digital field

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:16,880
applications but there are many more

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:20,159
use cases we call the naval so

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,159
please avik

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,479
so before we get into the field

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,320
application features

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,520
uh i would like to tell a bit about

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,960
finra finn

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,840
and um the financial well-being aspects

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,600
of uh

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,880
what we wanted to focus on like

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,399
simplifying

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,640
uh the daily standard of living

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:50,240
for the underserved markets and um

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,040
so as part of our we started two years

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,759
back

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,720
and first our focus was on building a

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,000
channel

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,560
uh leveraging the open open banking

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,280
movement

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,560
which was going on locally with a lot of

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,880
um

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,799
banks opening up their apis for

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:12,160
consumption

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:15,200
and um focusing on financial resilience

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:19,520
uh as part of that channel to to deliver

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,879
um to uh to the urban core

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,160
and uh and to tired two and three towns

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:29,840
in india and uh

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:33,760
initially we focused on the retail

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,879
agents who had uh like

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,680
had to accept a lot of cash and since

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,560
there was a

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,440
low penetration of point of sale device

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,560
and

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,840
atms and that's

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,040
where we wanted to

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,160
look at cash flow analysis and give

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,200
alternative

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,480
financing modes through um through

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,120
tickets

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,800
for sme lending anywhere between uh like

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,840
700 dollars to around

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,840
3 000 and

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,319
and once the merchants build uh credit

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,840
history

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:17,200
slowly give personalized line of

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,319
credit to the customers

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,640
who have been taking

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,400
goods and purchasing goods from these

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,959
merchants on credit

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,920
and tie all of these services together

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,480
through the

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,319
india stack which is not only open

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:37,360
banking but like open apis in general

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,400
so we'll cover some of these

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,400
in the next slides

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,959
so a lot of you finner actors would be

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,480
already comfortable with the digital

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,599
field application of me force

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,400
built on top of the finract apis which

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,280
is

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,080
built for the field staff of financial

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,560
institutions to use

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,680
initially it saw a lot of adoption from

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,159
micro finances

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,200
but over the years a lot of non-banking

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,480
financial

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,840
companies which which are called um

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,599
saccos or like credit unions in other

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,599
parts of the world

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,720
they started adopting the field of the

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,880
wrap and

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,519
customizing it as per their user

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,519
experience

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,120
so the agent application we focus on

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,680
to deliver a bouquet of service and

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,759
provide

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,800
access to the broader open fintech

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,639
system

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,280
to drive out cashless and paperless and

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,280
presenceless

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,040
services and as

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,160
as a follow-up part to that we have been

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,840
focusing on

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:53,280
fleet operators who operate small

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,560
networks of agents

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,240
focused on a particular goal some of

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,320
these fleet operators

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,280
already have a primary source of income

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,639
such as hyper local deliveries

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,639
and we wanted to streamline

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,960
such kind of fleet operations and

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,400
provide a secondary or tertiary source

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,479
of income

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:19,440
which won't impact their primary

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,440
sources of income

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,680
so the field officer application

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,360
which me force provides supports all the

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,120
functionalities around

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,199
customer group and center the

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,120
traditional joint liability groups

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,680
of how a group of micro loans

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,039
are given out by a field officer at a

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,479
center

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,240
and and strong

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,600
ethics around collections are

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,000
established

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,320
through compulsory group training and

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,639
group recognition training

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,440
supported through data tables which the

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,880
field of

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,120
field application has comprehensive

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,560
support for along with

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,840
onboarding with tired kyc and

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,600
photos for capturing signatures

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,319
capturing progress out of poverty index

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,440
surveys capturing location of the

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,680
customer

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:18,800
or the agent and such stuff

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,080
and also giving a bare bone

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,039
implementation for opening

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,280
loan accounts and configuring a product

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,639
and opening a loan account in a very

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,039
short turnaround time and

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,400
being able to collect through the

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,120
collection sheet

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,440
individual and group collection sheets

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,160
and

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,280
assign tasks in terms of through entity

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,840
data table checks

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:51,199
and other features which finra provides

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:54,080
which forces when a status changes from

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,199
the customer loan status changes from a

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,800
to b

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,440
what are the fields which needs to be

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,199
captured and tasks are driven through

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,759
that

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,199
and provide a basic set of reports for

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,880
the field officer

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:12,160
to assess what's going on the field

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:15,280
and recently um it has evolved

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:19,520
into offline sync and access which is

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:22,800
a very good feature which

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,840
which was very useful before um

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:30,080
jio came jio provides

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,560
low cost data to even uh tier four and

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,280
tier five villages

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,160
which has made offline sync in india

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,880
completely

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,880
unnecessary

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:49,039
right so we took

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:52,160
we mapped a lot of interact apis um

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,680
to we did a reverse mapping where we

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,560
thought of the api consumption from the

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,840
mobile

00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,560
consumption site and built

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,560
wrappers on top of finrax lending and

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,759
savings and deposit products and

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:09,520
payment apis to um

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:13,360
to simplify for certain payment

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:16,000
network operators and also to provide

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,520
standards for other kind of api

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,319
consumers which we'll cover

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,120
later so it comes pre-integrated with

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,960
the

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:30,160
prepaid wallet acquiring a license

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,320
to provide interest on wallet accounts

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,959
is uh very difficult in india

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,240
but uh prepaid wallets have seen a lot

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,640
of boom

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:44,080
and especially with a lot of

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:47,279
payment apis being opened up by banks

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:50,399
as part of the open movement and

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:53,839
uh having the ability to come

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,959
having a bare minimal product integrated

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,040
a lot of small

00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:01,440
micro loans um which are

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,000
just with a basic credit bureau check

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:09,839
that process has been commoditized

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,839
thanks to finrap and

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,800
as a phase to that what what we do on

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,279
top of that

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,000
task location we enable smart scheduling

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,240
we use

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,200
facebook's profit library to deliver

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,720
that

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,440
we allow a lot of monitoring

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,720
through um like elasticsearch and pvana

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,080
dashboards

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,279
and we have

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,080
kpis which are closely tied to the hyper

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,519
local

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:43,040
business model as well as the

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,120
footfall in the retail mode so that

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,240
productivity of each feed on street can

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,560
be tracked

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,320
and performance can be measured and

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:55,120
transactions can be incentivized

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,120
so that the volumes eventually come in

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:05,920
for the agent onboarding

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:09,760
we have a similar

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:13,200
app which uh is used for uh

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:16,079
like defining the targets uh

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,839
upgrading the agents like kyc so that

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,800
different services can be delivered by

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,040
the agent

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,720
based on their stage in the training

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,560
cycle

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,079
and also prospect the quality of agents

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,839
on which

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:33,760
complicated service can that agent

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,160
deliver

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,880
so some of these services are part of

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,800
the

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:44,800
open banking or india stack

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:48,000
like um the cash in cash out here

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:51,680
is primarily to the wallet

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,800
to a closed-loop wallet but with aeps

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,720
being other enabled payments which is

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,720
nothing but biometric enabled payments

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,160
which is small device

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,000
linked to the phone you the banking

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,760
ecosystem is opened up

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,959
to um customers who are far away from

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,640
any kind of

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:15,760
atm networks so

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:19,040
irrespective of the bank you can do a

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,760
cash deposit to to fund

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,920
uh the agent wallet and using that

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,600
balance any of the other transactions

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,480
can be driven

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,839
like a merchant payment or a money

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,839
transfer in the banking network

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:38,079
or like a disbursement

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,079
right

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,680
collection has evolved in a lot of ways

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,720
which we'll cover

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,680
one of the ways direct debit has seen a

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,800
very um

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:53,920
like the slowest evolution and has

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,839
recently been democratized

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,440
the physical mandate process in india

00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,399
has always been long

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,360
like it has traditionally been 15 to 20

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,720
days

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,279
and the modern open banking products

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,040
have

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,959
cut it down to a day to five days

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,160
physical mandates also have been kind of

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,000
digitized and

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,440
the completely separate authentication

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,320
process for

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,320
digital mandates and

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,680
bill pay networks and cash management

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,480
for

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,160
partners allows us to diversify the

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,399
booking

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:36,560
to provide more traction and

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,560
we are following the gsma standards

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,120
to for remittance and international

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,600
remittance so that any

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,600
network operators or any point of sale

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,760
integrators can

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,000
integrate by following a well defined

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:56,480
set of apis

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,480
these are our product partners

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:03,680
bill pays the open bill pay system where

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,639
all of that will it's regulated by

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,120
national payments corporation so that um

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,760
this

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,600
this compliance and audit even in bill

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,440
payment process

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:18,720
and the biometric network is again

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,519
maintained by npca and

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,639
this very rigorous audit process for

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,200
that

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,880
for since there are multiple agencies

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,600
where the biometric data

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,639
goes through and there are regulations

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,920
on

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:37,040
who can do that and who can't

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:43,040
so this authenticated user agencies

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:46,399
who can do this biometric based payments

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,680
and enach is

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,320
where you can collect money

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,199
it can be a recurring installment it can

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,320
be

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:58,720
your subscriptions

00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,440
so these things can be auto debited from

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,639
bank account

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:06,800
everyone has a bank account even though

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:10,240
cards are not that much

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,399
popular in entire three four five

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,920
tons and villages but everyone has a

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,519
bank account most of

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:21,040
them are dormant but the point is

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,680
having a bank account enables

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,199
those customers to use such services

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,360
through biometrics

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,360
even in the remotest village

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:36,560
and um we use quarter class area of

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:40,240
insurance products micro life

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,880
micro health uh two wheeler insurances

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,360
which were like there's no paperwork

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,760
involved

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:50,959
all of it is digital and

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:54,639
for micro investments where

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:57,760
instead of depositing if a customer's

00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,240
behavior on analysis they have more risk

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,360
taking capacity and

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,959
they our agents are trained

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,360

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,519
a very important problem in the indian

has a lot of benefit

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:45,759
schemes but most of it is not

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:49,360
transferred to the right beneficiary

nearby towns and cities

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:16,000
so we provide

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,959
transactional banking analysis

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,839
for from a performance point of view we

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,640
have adopted

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,919
me first payment hub over the past six

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,199
months

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:30,880
and we tracked the

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:34,400
performance as well as the

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,400
the business metrics

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,240
so this is our fleet app where

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,640
small set of network operators can

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,799
quickly onboard digitally and

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,559
deliver door step banking within a

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:55,200
community

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:58,559
and the fleet operator can monitor and

00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:03,039
instruct um the like

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:06,080
the beat plans of such field officers

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:08,559
and they can see which

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,799
customer has requested which facility at

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:14,160
their doorstep

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,520
so that um they can either accept reject

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:28,799
or prioritize

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:34,240
and schedule their beat plan

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,240
so this um covers that aspect

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:43,840
most of our fleet most of our agents

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:43,840
are women entrepreneurs

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,720
so what we try to build is uh financial

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,880
resilience

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:55,520
so we let our customer promise

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,000
to save something as part of a goal they

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,520
set for

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,520
themselves and

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:06,160
through notifications we nudge them

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,520
every month through the agents we

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,720
encourage them to

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,919
meet those goals either through

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,919
a savings product in a traditional bank

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,039
or through tailored investment advice

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,240
for

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,520
systemic investment plans that fits

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,640
their goals

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,760
and we question against

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:31,919
their volatility is by allowing like

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:35,679
credit on tap this is um

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,679
something we are still working on

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,520
this requires a business correspondent

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,640
model

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:46,080
which is uh still being defined

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,960
in india which uh says like

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:52,960
how co-ending uh structures evolve from

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:56,240
the traditional on lending structures

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:59,280
and through kodak we provide

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,840
insurances to cover license and

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,840
certainties

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:12,480
how we deliver these things

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:14,960
by it's mostly by leveraging me force

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,919
payment hub for the rails which uh this

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,919
one

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,520
will be telling us more about tomorrow

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,720
in the real time

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:26,880
payment stock and

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:30,159
we use finrac for the account management

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,280
and for the loans loan products

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,440
that apps we have modified for

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,120
the user experience we wanted for the

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,600
indian ecosystem

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:45,120
and we have in the rails also we have

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:48,320
diverged a bit to

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:51,760
help define the rules which our

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:54,320
complaints partners wished to see in the

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,320
dashboards

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,240
so this is the minimal deployment

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,360
structure

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,720
which this would be part of the jetbook

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:10,159
link which this one shared

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:13,440
we are following this deployment model

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:15,039
for um or we are using vba for

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,039
orchestrating

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:21,200
and this entire uh

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,120
clustered all the components inside

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,640
kubernetes since they

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:29,600
allow clustering uh failover and

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,240
high availability scaling up later won't

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,240
be an issue

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,280
and

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:44,400
we are using a single engine right now

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,840
and for our direct debits and other open

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,760
banking apis

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:54,320
we have worked on reconciliation

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:57,600
reports and the kafka cluster really

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,039
ensures that data integrity is there in

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,159
the elastic search

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,120
previously we were facing issues where

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,520
um

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,320
this directly from we were using web

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,280
hooks

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,039
to sync the data into the elk stack web

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,559
books and log stash

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,360
and there was a inconsistency in the

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,919
data

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,039
introducing kafka has greatly reduced

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,039
that inconsistency

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:33,120
the epa standardization we have been

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:37,039
working with shubham uh during this

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:41,679
google summer of code to implement this

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:43,919
gsma mobile money standards so that

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,240
they are not very roughly defined for

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,039
each use case and

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,480
the same apis can the different flavors

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,520
of an api can be

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,280
consumed by slightly different roles in

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,200
the ecosystem

00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,720
so though the folks over at gsm has put

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,480
a lot of thought into

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:08,000
how these apis can be standardized and

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,159
how transactions

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
how how do your transactions can be

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,880
recovered

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,360
where um not only during timeouts but

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,400
for

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,400
internal states

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,720
for internal inconsistent states later

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,080
so this

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,080
covers some of those things

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,039
where we are not using any kind of ussd

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,039
here

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,400
no

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,400
this is the part where we have

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,960
uh in addition to the great work shubham

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,080
has done over the summer

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,000
uh for integrating with the gsm specs we

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,480
have additionally adopted the

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,320
gsms specs as part of the channel

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,520
connector to be able to accept the

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,080
requests

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,120
so that this consistency on the pair and

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,600
pay side

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:05,840
no matter which role we are playing in

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,840
the ecosystem

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,760
i would i don't want to go into details

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,960
of

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,799
these two essential

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,039
like this will be covered i guess

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:24,080
tomorrow in much more details

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:27,200
but the the partitioning

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:30,840
and the completely embedded database for

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,760
payments have been a great boon

00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:38,000
as the process state and the pod

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:41,039
restartability in kubernetes um

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,240
with like no database to maintain um and

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:49,440
state mismatches haven't been an issue

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,440
tracking down straight mismatches and

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,120
right even for bottlenecks we have seen

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,240
that it's

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,159
much more fault tolerant and

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,679
we have replicated in our load testing

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,080
environment how the

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,520
leader election has leader direction

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,240
works by

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,480
making situations where one node goes

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,480
down

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,279
so that the operation continues

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,279
uninterrupted

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,679
since uh one critical part of this is

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,679
like

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:33,279
capability to handle cases

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:37,360
across multiple pods

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,360
and across multiple nodes

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:45,279
especially drilling down in the

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:48,159
elastic search through a proxy

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,919
and putting access control on top of the

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:53,279
proxy to

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,360
view um to put

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:58,240
to expose the keyboard dashboards not

00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:02,000
only to central operations but also to

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:04,640
supervisors and super agents

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,520
so to speak who monitor the micro

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,559
networks

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,559
microagent networks

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,279
so how the leadership is handled over to

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,000
a node

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:22,640
in case of failure of one node um

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,640
maybe one can tell a bit more about that

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,159
tomorrow

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,919
so as part of a fleet uh there are

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,840
tall boots and such thing which have

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,799
been digitized in the open

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,039
banking parts so for that uh we are

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,679
implementing fast tag

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,440
which takes only a couple of seconds to

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,760
cross at all booth instead of paying in

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,760
cash

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,440
enash has hasn't really taken off yet

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,480
but there's a lot of prospect

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:56,159
since customers have been

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,600
at the like for loan turnaround times

00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,240
have been uh

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,440
bottlenecked by the physical mandate

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,600
registration

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,000
which as i was saying it takes up to

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,320
three weeks

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,320
and

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,440
there's an authentication process though

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,240
where you have to authenticate using

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,200
debit card or net banking for enact

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,720
which is still an

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:24,640
issue for delivering it to the

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:26,880
rural customers which uh

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,039
which the open uh banking ecosystem is

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,279
evolving and would slowly try to address

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:34,080
over time

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,840
and close loop cards again for expense

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,799
management of the agents

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,840
for for activities such as refilling

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,039
fuel

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,919
we are looking into that as well as

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,000
partnering with

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,200
point-of-sale device to drive those

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,640
things

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,559
and other than

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,760
biometric based payments we haven't

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:57,039
looked into

00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:00,320
the ekyc part which is again

00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:03,120
other um there was a case

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,120
a year back which reduced the barrier to

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,559
entry for providing identity

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,720
based apis previously the authenticated

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:14,399
user agency license is to be

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:18,960
granted to a very special few

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:21,679
now authenticated user agencies um

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,720
you need not get the license to offer a

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:28,080
very basic form of ekyc

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:31,679
only and even offline kyc is

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:35,039
right now you can do it via

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,039
other based apis

00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:45,840
so do you guys have any questions

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,840
raft protocol for failover we are not

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:27,840
sure how it's

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:27,840
internally implemented

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,919
hello avik thank you for your

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:47,760
presentation

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:51,200
it was very interesting uh a lot of work

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,960
you have done there uh and and

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,799
you're being with me for some finrak

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,679
then for a long time now you're one of

00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,039
the

00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:08,080
oldest contributors in the in the show

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:10,159
so thank you for for the presentation

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,159
