From loan origination to loan collections, from e-commerce to remittances, from savings to billpay, there are a wide range of use cases and different types of field staff and agents that DFAs enable. The APIs in Fineract already power a broad variety of digital field applications but there are many more use cases we could enable. Avik Ganguly of Fynarfin will explore the spectrum of digital field applications, the requirements they entail and the roadmap we can advance in Fineract. Heâ€™ll illustrate the breadth of the Fineract APIs by presenting a case study on the agent banking solution his team has built on top of Fineract.

Avik Ganguly is the founder of Fynarfin, a fintech company building scalable enterprise solutions on top of Apache Fineract. Avik is a Fintech specialist and open source evangelist who picked up his trade while working with Mifos, Conflux and Novopay.
