Description: 
	Open Source as a counterweight to PlatFins (facebook, Google, Tencent, Alibaba)
James Dailey

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

The public square needs open source for payments, banking, identity and financial inclusion. Fortunately, a number of projects, some new, some old are there to provide a stack for payments and banking for everyone on the planet. We’ll survey some recent developments in Fineract, Mifos Payment Gateway, Mojaloop, and related technologies around auth, identity, and put it together with announcements around open G2P, open Banking, CBDC, and open ID. We'll get into tech enablers like biometrics on a secure device. We’ll put together a stack of technology built on Fineract, and demonstrate what might be possible. From remittances to self-sovereign identity, we’ll explore how these new trends intersect with specific technologies. Low cost, cloud, offline device enabled, the future is open.

James Dailey is the Board Chair and founder of Mifos, the open source community that created and then contributed the fineract code base. He works at the intersection of financial inclusion and energy inclusion in the global south. A serial entrepreneur, James has created several social ventures and open source projects, aimed at solving big hairy problems. He sits on the fineract PMC and helps with identifying gaps and strategies.

[Music]

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,800
i the founder and the the guy who

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,000
created

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,800
the first white paper of lifos

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,440
a few years ago i will let you do the

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,160
month and

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,879
tell everybody how many years ago uh it

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,239
was

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:50,160
kind of a missionary and and actually a

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,320
uh entrepreneur who decided to

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,920
to put that idea on a white paper and

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,520
let the world enjoy

00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:02,559
what we are now enjoying so um please

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,559
uh i i the floor is yours and

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,799
he's going to talk about the platfins

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,320
and how to contemplate them with finra

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,640
i hope okay thank you javier um

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,400
i i hope everybody can see my screen i

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,680
think it's it's working

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,759
um so yeah so

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,720
this began this this journey of mine

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,080
began

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,960
um 2001 2002 when i wrote that paper and

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,720
we got the project started um

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,799
it was it looked a lot different than

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,680
the world did and

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,880
you know um facebook was you know mark

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,079
zuckerberg was still it

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,240
at harvard um alibaba had been launched

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,560
but alipay was another

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,600
you know two three years into the future

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,000
um

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:51,680
aws was a few years into the future

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,720
so it was pre-cloud pre um

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,280
these big platforms um

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,640
and so it's quite astounding how how in

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,640
in some respects

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:06,320
they've come so far um and i wanted to

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:10,399
give a couple of stats so in 2019

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:13,360
the um visa union pay mastercard

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,400
folks of the world did something around

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,800
um

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:22,239
close to 300 um well 380 billion

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,200
transactions globally um and in china

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,120
alone

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,959
there was a hundred billion transactions

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,400
and the vast majority of those were on

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,840
the platforms

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:35,200
and so if you look today at where these

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,000
global platforms these are facebook the

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,599
10 cents

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,640
the uh alibaba alipay um

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,879
amazon where these where these uh

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,319
platforms are today they're doing

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,920
effectively the same

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,720
volume or they're they're at just about

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,680
the volume

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,400
of credit card companies globally which

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,800
is just an

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,280
astounding thing i mean it took the

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,040
banking sector from you know the 1800s

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,200
to the mid-1900s

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,480
to really build up transaction volumes

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,440
on payments

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,400
um and and then the credit cards came on

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,239
and they took from the 1950s to the

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,040
1970s 1980s to really

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,400
get traction and be ubiquitous in in

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,720
certain economies

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,840
but the platforms these super platforms

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,120
have actually gone from

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,560
zero to you know equivalence

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,159
uh within you know 15 years let's say or

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,120
even less in some cases

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,760
so this is an astounding development but

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,360
also

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,080
you know i think raises the point that

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,360
um they are

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,200
they are enough that people do not

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,080
understand what role they are to play or

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,120
where they

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,920
what role they should play um

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,040
in our global um economy in our in our

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,280
society

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,879
so there's a new term that was uh coined

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,319
by vikas raj

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,159
that these are the super platform

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,120
companies that are playing this very

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,920
central

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,159
role in the financial lives of you know

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,280
billions of people effectively

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,120
um and uh they

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,400
are doing this not they're doing

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,840
payments and they're doing these

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,799
financial accounts

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,239
not because that's what they think is uh

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,760
you know their core business

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,359
but they do it because it's it's a

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,120
required functionality and

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,639
they don't treat it as a profit center

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,479
this is very different from how the

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,759
banks or the credit card companies

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,440
behave so can we oh

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,040
can we use open source projects to

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,919
disrupt the platforms

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,639
or the platfins um is this the wrong

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,160
question

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:40,720
um of course uh i love this little uh

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,720
uh xkcd um

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,240
joke here that you know um all modern

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,759
digital infrastructures really has a has

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,240
a lot of open source

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,560
so in some sense the platforms out there

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,720
are already using open source

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,320
and we're part of that story and the

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,120
open source movements are part of that

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,440
story

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,320
so it may be the wrong question i'm

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,759
trying to

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:07,520
sort of get to what i mean by

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:11,440
how we coexist how we um can work

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:14,479
uh on something that is um

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,680
you know with them but also a little bit

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,639
uh more interesting uh as an open source

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,600
um proposition so let's let's get to it

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,000
so

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,199
what advantages do these platforms have

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,280
these platfins

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,400
so they get massive data but the more

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,880
important thing is they have massive

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,039
data

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,560
insights so they process the data they

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,080
get the insights

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,440
they drive towards lower cost

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,960
transactions because again it's not a

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,600
profit center

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,520
they are powered by this commoditized

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,800
infrastructure this cloud-based

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,320
stuff um in economics

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,880
we would say that they combine three

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,280
things they combine economies of scale

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,400
because they have you know millions and

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,320
tens of millions and hundreds of

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,160
millions then billions of people

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,319
they are powered by economies of scope

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,080
they go from do i need to get across

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,120
town do i need to order groceries do i

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,400
need to get a loan

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,680
and the next thing they just go to the

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,120
next thing the next thing the next thing

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,800
you think of amazon

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,440
starting in books and now in everything

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,919
um economies of demand these are also

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,039
known as network effects so you get

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,919
you know these these systems have the

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,919
ability to

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:25,520
to create demand on their platform

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,520
because everybody is there

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,479
uh so there are a couple of things now

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,479
that i want to sort of

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,240
highlight these are topics that are

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,840
going to come up in other finrax

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,639
sessions throughout the apache con

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,960
and so open banking is one of the things

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,560
that

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,960
is in some sense a counterweight to the

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,960
platfins so rather than a single

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,199
monolithic platform

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,880
an ecosystem approach comes about

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,720
because of open banking

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,400
the european union has been a leader at

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,919
this they have something called payment

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,440
systems directive one

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,000
which really was about the back-end

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,720
systems the the switch systems between

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,120
the banks financial institutions and

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,880
then psd2 which is more recent

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,960
which concerns the development of an

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,800
ecosystem of providers that sit on top

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,720
of the banking services

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,960
so these include the account information

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,960
service providers and the payment

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:24,560
initiation pa service providers that are

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:27,360
legal entities that are allowed via apis

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,880
to connect to the banking systems this

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,080
is not actually the reality yet in the

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,400
united states

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,840
but the federal reserve and others are

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,440
looking very carefully at how to

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,319
implement open banking in the united

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,080
states

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,440
the take away the technical takeaway i

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,400
think from this is that

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,360
these api driven architectures could

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,800
provide

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,840
an ecosystem of providers and innovators

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,879
as long as there is a a source of good

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,080
funds

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,319
and so we're going to talk a little bit

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,240
more into that so

00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:01,039
another talk uh to bring this to sort of

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,840
reality is the the payments hub by

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:06,080
miphos which sits on top of finrac

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,440
um and wraps it in some sense has this

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,039
very important thing which is the

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,319
banking channel connectors which is

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,680
implementing

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:16,800
the wso2 apis which are

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,639
actually the psd

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,440
ii um payments initiators

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,960
and account initiators that i talked

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,639
about in the last slide

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,400
so so the mephos wrapping of thin iraq

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,640
allows it to do that thing we were just

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,200
talking about which is the ecosystem

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,120
so this talk is on thursday real-time

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,959
payments enabling a connected cashless

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,479
and inclusive society

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,000
so i encourage you to listen to that one

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,000
as well

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,360
and then the documentation for this is

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,240
is online there

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,240
at the gitbook

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,880
data insights now remember i talked

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,600
about how these large platforms get data

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,279
insights

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,600
and what i think we want to observe is

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,320
that data insights are important not

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,040
necessarily

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,560
the data ibm one of the sponsors of this

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,200
conference so i'll just do a shout out

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,800
to them

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,800
you know they're doing some cutting edge

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,440
research which

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,560
is about how do you federate data

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,519
insights via

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,360
machine learning um types of of

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,240
approaches where you can share the

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,760
the output of the model and uh and then

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,880
you know use that

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,160
um model uh that's trained to access

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,000
other data sources and

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,920
and come up with new insights and then

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,279
you you create additional

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,120
um trained models on top of that and so

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,560
lots of stuff most of it i can't

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,800
understand so

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,120
i encourage folks to go to uh the

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,399
session on thursday um

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,279
uh about ai for all uh which will get

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,480
into these

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,360
you know data science um things i guess

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,399
the question that i

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,320
that i am bringing up is do we really

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:56,000
need the ability to combine the data

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:59,040
um and and probably the answer is no so

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,720
uh we can do that uh with out

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,480
getting all of the uh data in one place

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,440
which means that we can break up in some

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,880
sense

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,360
the economies of of scope

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,959
right we can counter the economies of

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,800
scope by having data insights which

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,320
allow us to go to new

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,839
areas without necessarily taking on

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,160
new and new product lines um

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,160
so

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,800
this is another big big topic um

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,720
identification and there are many

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,240
projects out there that relate to

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:39,360
identification

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:42,800
um it is a rabbit hole

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,200
for me in trying to uh to delve into

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,200
this but

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,640
but i do want to function i do want to

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,920
point out a few different things

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,560
one um you know there's this movement

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,360
towards

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,720
uh self-sovereign identity and the

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,320
sovereign

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,760
foundation and those folks might

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,320
actually be here

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:04,160
um and the uh the related work at ibm

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,480
around hyperledger and these different

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,880
working groups that bring together

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,000
you know uh self-sovereign and identity

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,720
systems and and

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,399
other types of blockchain kinds of

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,320
solutions for

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:22,240
credentials and and identity systems

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,079
and then a separate area is uh the w3c

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,480
has spent the last you know six seven

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,720
years getting to

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,920
a standard now called verifiable

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,480
credentials

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,320
um and these can be either blockchain or

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,000
non-blockchain they can they don't have

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,079
to be a distributed ledger

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,079
approach um w3c has also just

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,440
this week released something called

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,640
distributed id

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,120
um as a working draft and so those

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,000
you know those things are are going on

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,320
um

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,120
in the world in which uh you know the

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,399
work that i

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,279
i do um we're often talking about the

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,040
difference between

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,399
functional id and and foundational id

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,480
and so it's important to sort of

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:08,079
understand that uh that this

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,040
dichotomy is if you have a voter's card

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:13,040
or you have a

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:15,120
a school id or you have a

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,399
you know some other id to get into a

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,240
building that's a

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:24,000
functional id but uh if you have a

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:27,920
passport um you know if you have a

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,399
uh if you have a social security card

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,560
these are foundational ids that are

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,560
typically issued by governments

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,320
and there are you know roughly 2.7

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,839
billion people in the world that

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,760
lack adequate foundational id um

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,600
and so it's a huge number of people are

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,639
excluded one of the projects that i'll

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,519
talk about is mossip which is an open

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,760
source

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,959
identity project um

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,959
i also wanted to bring in something

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,120
which i find

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,800
a little bit tangential to identity but

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,760
which i think has the potential to

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,279
really

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,160
shift the um shift the conversation and

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,079
that is

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,000
looking at the hardware like everybody's

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,480
focused on smartphones

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,760
i'm not entirely sure that that's what

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,959
we're gonna see

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,360
five years from now um and i

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,760
i think that biometric payment cards are

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,040
something to keep your eye on

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,800
they don't need to connect to a

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,760
centralized server they can use the

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,800
locally

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,040
stored template for authentication

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,279
it the data is actually stored on the

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,760
card making it more secure

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,360
and you can use them as well to do

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,880
contactless interface

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,040
interfaces for payments or other

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,199
transactions and so

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,440
the projections are this this area is

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:47,279
going to grow tremendously over the next

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,160
uh you know four years

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,360
um as different regions begin to see

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,199
these cards come out

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,199
they can be produced for lower cost than

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,600
a smartphone of course

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,720
and uh they may become more ubiquitous

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,000
as a result of those

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,399
economics and the functional

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,839
ability that they bring and then of

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,399
course you can also imagine

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,279
smartphones operating as biometric

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,720
payment cards

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,120
so i think that's an interesting part of

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,839
identity and how to achieve

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,160
inclusive identity is through a hardware

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,160
angle

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,800
just diving a little bit further into

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,040
the w3c verifiable credentials

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,920
um you know the concept is you have

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,440
proofs you have

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,639
claims um the

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,760
you don't necessarily have to have a

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,079
trusted uh domain but you could have a

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:41,440
trusted domain you could use a kind of

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,720
um x 509 type of approach uh with with

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,399
these kinds of

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,959
um so uh and then the last one is this

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,079
um

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,519
foundational id concept this is an

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,160
active project they're using it to

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:57,760
implement a national id in morocco

00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,480
in guinea in the philippines um

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,680
they're they're promoting an open source

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,680
project

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:08,639
to solve a very fundamental issue

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,399
um globally which is identity so i think

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,839
all these projects are very interesting

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,120
and and how they combine is super

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,120
important

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:21,360
um and mention uh the next thing to talk

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,160
about would be mojo loop so mojo loop i

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,160
i had a a part in articulating some of

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,399
this architecture early on

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,279
and what it does is it creates the

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:34,240
switching platform between

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,600
an account system so a banking system or

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,040
a wallet system

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,040
and it does a real-time push

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,360
transaction which is a little different

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,839
than how the us credit card system works

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,360
on a

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:49,680
on a poll basis uh it's a

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,000
fully open source project and you can

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,720
look it up mojoloop.io

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,040
so at the simplest level excuse me

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,320
we have um identification as an

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,959
underlying thing which is super

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,360
important

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,079
and it's a very active field and i would

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,360
say it's

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,839
it's it's complex complicated

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,000
but there are solutions there and the

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,160
point is there are many solutions and so

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,279
we will see how that goes there are

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,240
accounts

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,120
um and finrac provides that there are

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,040
payments

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,440
finrac can connect to these payment

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,839
systems and then there are ecosystems of

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,920
services that can sit on top of that

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,360
and then of course there's another talk

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,560
that's going to get into the insights

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,160
the data insights

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,759
that can combine these things so

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,079
these are all powered by open source

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:41,440
projects and they can create

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:44,639
digital public goods around this concept

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,680
which in some sense is my fundamental

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,440
contention the platforms came up

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,720
they're a necessary innovation they're a

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,160
necessary

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:58,320
way that we are coming into a new age

00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:01,360
but there could be a trajectory where

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,959
instead of privately held super

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,240
platforms we can have public

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,880
digital goods that that instead provide

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,919
the same

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,959
level of functionality but do it um

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,559
at a more publicly oriented

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,240
uh way and i think that that would be a

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:20,319
very positive um

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,120
evolution so um let me also mention why

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,640
i think that this

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:28,400
is that this is possible

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,039
so um the bank of international

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,480
settlements is a

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,760
central bank of central banks if you

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,360
will it's you know the world bank imf

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,960
bank of international settlements it's

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,240
that entity

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,799
and they released in 2018 this

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,240
this fascinating exploration of central

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,039
bank digital currencies

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,120
which is really saying to the world look

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,840
central banks could do this thing

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,280
that that these other you know largely

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,080
blockchain oriented

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,880
providers are saying that they could do

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,280
um

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,120
and they can do it in a way that will

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,880
provide both wholesale

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,120
and general purpose payments uh with

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,360
with you know implications for monetary

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,000
policy and financial stability

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,760
it really suggests a wider role for

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,760
central banks in the economy

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,280
which is to say it's a it's an

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,400
articulation of

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,600
creating a broader public good

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,520
um in banking and

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,520
this idea uh is actually a live

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,679
conversation in the united states

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:36,880
um there's a stanford social um

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:39,280
ssrn paper that that you know

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,000
was written by several lawyers that

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,880
really gets

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,320
into how this could be created and it

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,720
doesn't have to be blockchain of course

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,280
it does it can be simply using existing

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,720
centralized types of systems but the

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,520
idea is that it would be digital payment

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,080
accounts

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,799
that would be federal um they'd be fed

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,760
accounts

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,880
be aimed at the underbanked and unbanked

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,320
in the united states

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,240
and have zero fees and these things are

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,160
continue to advance in the conversation

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,480
and at the political level as well

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,320
so this idea is not entirely crazy to

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,080
have a public option to have a public

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,720
infrastructure

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,799
um so what would this look like for a

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,720
public square financial platform that

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,600
gets into this more innovative space

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,160
that these platforms occupy right now

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,679
well

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,280
the idea is that you'd have you start

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,760
off with some sort of id

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,880
a distributed id a verifiable credential

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,440
etc

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,520
you'd have some way to connect that to

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,960
the apache finrac platform

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,840
you'd have the um you know machine

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,760
learning ai tools that connect to that

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,679
you'd have the mifos payments hub

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,600
which connects you to the mojo loop

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,960
switch you have the miphos payments

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,640
connector on top of that

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,799
and then that allows for these you know

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,640
innovative fintech platforms

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,160
so it could look like this we could have

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,039
these kinds of public

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,039
goods provided like this um or we could

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,280
also have it look like this which were

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,640
would be you know you have all the same

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,159
things but they're more vertically

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,760
oriented you could have a clean energy

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,159
provider fintech that

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,600
uses all of these open source tools

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,360
again connects

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,880
and with the payment switches and then

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,679
you have another innovative fintech or

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,120
another vertical

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:18,559
set of verticals in that space

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,600
these functionalities then are available

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,440
um you know nearly available today the

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,480
the gaps that we have right now in our

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,799
technical stack

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,159
are actually not that many to achieve

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,400
this kind of vision

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,840
uh we're we're working on this actively

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,880
and i think some of the talks later on

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,679
this week

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:40,720
will go into some of those those topics

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,640
um so i'm hoping

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,480
that there will be some questions and we

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,440
can get into a further discussion

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,679
those are my generally my ideas and i

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:54,000
may have spoken too fast

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,000
i'm gonna stop now and see where we are

00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:01,120
um so uh

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,120
how fast did i talk

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,840
oh boy i took up way too little time on

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,880
that

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,280
um very good are there any questions

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,280
over here

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,480
there's no uh written question uh

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:31,840
yeah oh your audio is terrible javier

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,840
at least for me is that me

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,919
no no you've got some weird audio

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,840
problems

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,799
max headroom for those of you who

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,840
remember that

00:21:52,799 --> 00:22:00,159
um excellent

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:03,840
um okay uh

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,559
so uh i what i guess i would love to do

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,440
is

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,720
you know dive into a few other concepts

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,120
if any folks

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:16,480
have um have questions on them um

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,440
if i could go back to um

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,320
thinking about what the you know the big

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,360
idea here

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,200
is um these

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,799
these platforms that do all of these

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,840
things now in our lives

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:32,159
they're they're privately held

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,480
they are you know potentially going to

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,760
be regulated more and more

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,600
um and there are some parts of their

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,039
functionality which

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,320
are not necessarily um

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,799
they don't necessarily need to be

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,000
private and i think if we can get our

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,039
heads around

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,240
you know banking has been doing you know

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:56,159
payments monetary policy from

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,679
the very beginning of banking if we get

00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,159
our heads around that that is a public

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,320
good

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,360
you know when when we reach in to our

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,600
wallets for a

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,600
a bill that's actually a public good

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,880
those that physical cash has been there

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,440
for you know forever as far as we can

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,400
tell

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,520
but that's actually a an artifact of of

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,559
human civilization

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,799
so we we created that concept

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,000
we made it into a public good and so

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,320
we're now at this point

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,919
and perhaps an inflection point in these

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,200
platforms where we can say

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,720
look what you're doing is actually a

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,720
public good what you're doing is

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,120
actually something that we all need

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,960
and we need to do it at cost and we need

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,240
to provide it to everybody

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,480
um and my contention i guess is that we

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,520
actually have the tools now in

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:45,039
finrac in mojo loop in

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,120
these identity systems that you know

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,600
if we're not there right now we could

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,480
soon be and so as a counterweight

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,159
to these you know privately funded very

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,960
massive platforms

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,840
could we imagine an open source um

00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,840
approach to this

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,360
um all right so i i i doubled down on

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,000
that point i hope that that was

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,720
useful for folks um there was a question

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,080
here about

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,400
um these emv cards so

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,799
yeah there are new there's a new set of

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:22,400
technologies where um they're thin

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:26,799
film um printed circuits

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:30,320
which have a a battery um they have a

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:32,960
a built-in bluetooth um capability

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,080
and they also have a a fingerprint or

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,120
thumb print

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,880
um reader builds onto the card

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,039
um there are a few providers that are

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,480
that are working on these things

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:47,679
and this is a new

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,799
a new way to bring um security

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:53,039
to uh to a card

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:55,200
form feature and and some of the some of

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,039
the applications are around security

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,679
issues right so

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,880
you need a special card which only

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,720
biometrically

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,400
verifies for you which then sends a

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,080
bluetooth signal to your

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,559
computer saying that you've been you've

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:12,080
been it's like an update to the rsa

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:14,320
you know timed rsa kind of security code

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,840
but it's biometrically verified you know

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,360
you have to be alive

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:22,480
um it has to be you and it's it's card

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,000
it's card form feature um or form

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,120
factors

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,799
um and yeah uh i i think

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,559
that you know this is just one hardware

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,640
what i was trying to do in this in this

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,640
talk is that um

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,080
when we think about the future when we

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,360
think about the future we should think

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,360
about where we've come from and

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,720
again 20 years ago these platforms

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,039
didn't exist

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,400
um and so somebody had to create them

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,480
somebody did create them

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,640
and they're now taking over the world in

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,840
in some very meaningful ways

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,760
uh and yet you know we're not passive

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,520
members of this conversation we

00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,840
we can actually have an influence on

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,279
this by virtue of having some very

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,840
powerful tools that are

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,760
at our disposal we have cloud technology

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,240
it's it's available and and

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,840
uh you know you can get basically the

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,320
same computing power that

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,880
these platforms have because it's cloud

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,679
and

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,360
so we can do that we have the code that

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,000
does accounts that does payments that

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,840
does

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,400
you know connection to an ecosystem of

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,159
providers that could connect to identity

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,840
that's a gap right now in the finrac

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,760
project project i would say is

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,279
we don't connect well to identity

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,520
providers yet we don't

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,320
yet have a good way of bringing that

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,080
into the

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,159
into the system and we have we have the

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,039
ability to record tokens or you know we

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,159
have some

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:42,240
connection to fido 502 i think some you

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,559
know enhancements are going on there

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,640
but in terms of providing that as a

00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,640
service or connecting to a service that

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,080
can then leverage but those are some

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,600
things that we may want to

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:57,039
to work on um so

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:59,440
um yeah uh i i don't know what else

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,640
are there any other questions here and

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,360
and javier

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,360
help me out here

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,720
oh you're still you're still very very

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,840
uh

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:21,840
maybe you could type into the

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:21,840
the corner here

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:37,039
okay so um

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,440
so uh giorgio no i've i've been going

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:42,080
for um

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,559
20 minutes and i've actually completed

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,080
my

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:48,960
my presentation um at record speed

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,600
um i think i get too much caffeine and i

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,880
just

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:55,120
i spoke too quickly um

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,559
so but i will sort of answer some of

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,760
these questions a little bit more so the

00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,799
platfens

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,600
are the google lollipe um folks of the

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,120
world

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:07,360
and how do we compete against them so uh

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,360
i i think the building blocks are the

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,399
technologies right so the technologies

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,000
are there that allow us to do allow us

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,399
to compete

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,520
um on each of the three things that i

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,240
say are

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,440
are responsible for their success so the

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,760
three things that are

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,640
responsible for their success are

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,120
economies

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,760
of scale right so they have economies of

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,919
scale

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,919
meaning they offer their service for a

00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,320
lower and lower cost

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,919
the more that they offer the service

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,960
that's the definition of economies of

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,000
scale

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,880
cloud services i would argue allow us to

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,320
offer

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,360
services at a lower and lower per unit

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,720
cost

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:51,919
um over time um because of

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,159
the nature of you know cloud

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,480
because you're you're getting

00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,080
dispatchable capacity whenever you need

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,480
it and the average cost of that

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,159
continues to fall so that's economies of

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,279
scale the second one is economies of

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,200
scope

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,679
well i think you can get economies of

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,840
scope meaning different products

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,120
you know the idea of you know uber

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,080
started in

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,600
um try amazon amazon started in books

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,679
but then went to household goods and

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,000
went to digital you know et cetera

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,679
um and so adjacencies and so they have

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,799
everything on their platform

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:28,080
and uh if you have an

00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:31,120
approach with um

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:34,559
with the ability to do account

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,720
lookups and information lookups then you

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:39,360
have the ability to offer

00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,480
all the different kinds of services on

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,919
one

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,840
on one thing even when they're offered

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:47,039
by other people so

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,440
um if you think about how

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,200
uh ali alibaba operates it's

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,440
fundamentally different than how

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,360
amazon works amazon works by having

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,799
everything under one platform

00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:02,399
and uh and you are you know your vendors

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:06,159
are there um and alibaba works with

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:09,360
um you know a different you know

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:11,679
a merchant marketplace so it's a little

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,480
bit closer to ebay than it is to

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,039
amazon and so if you can imagine

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,440
different

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:19,120
business models and you can imagine

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,960
technology powering

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,240
an ecosystem of providers

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,120
so rather than everything on one

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:30,720
platform you're able to have the same

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:33,840
number of additional scope

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,320
um products services

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,039
by connecting these uh and the

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,799
underlying

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,799
building blocks of that is the ability

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:43,200
to do accounts

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,360
and the ability to deployments and so if

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,760
you look at it from that perspective

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,960
um you could have a complete input

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,000
system of our services that just keep

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,399
growing and growing and growing and

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,039
growing

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:56,640
and could grow faster than what um some

00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,159
of these platforms are able to do so

00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,440
that would be that argument

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,200
and then the network effects are

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,320
basically relying on the same kinds of

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,480
things and so

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,640
um and i think there you'd have to have

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,320
um you'd have to have smart marketing

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,760
people to try to say well all of this is

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,399
part of a

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,840
you know this kind of platform and the

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,159
reason why i think this is important is

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,279
that different countries could decide

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,960
you know look we want we want to have

00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:23,200
our own facebook in this country or in

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,279
this region or on this continent

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,960
how could we do that well we could take

00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,320
these open source tools and start to

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,000
build a fundamental

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,320
building blocks of it and we can start

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,559
to encourage an ecosystem of providers

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,000
and that would provide a counterweight

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,640
to these big platforms

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,360
and it would bring it within that

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:47,600
regional

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:51,679
or country level type of approach

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:54,720
um if there are no other questions folks

00:31:51,679 --> 00:32:01,360
um i'm happy to wrap up um

00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:03,679
i i

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,559
i i think i thank you for your time and

00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,799
your attention

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,080
um there are a lot of good talks coming

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,120
up this week i was trying to highlight

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,080
some of them

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,960
the uh just to go through a few of those

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,440
uh

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,440
you know we have uh open banking a

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,640
revolutionary democratizing force for

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,880
financial service

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,320
innovation coming up with victor romero

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,799
who's gonna talk about

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:29,520
um some of what he's been working on in

00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:32,549
mexico um

00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,549
[Music]

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:40,960
kenya i believe and matt has been

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,679
working in the uk uh with updrafts so

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,840
that's a good

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,600
thing to attend we have digital field

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,720
applications coming up uh

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,559
at 12 35 today uh and that's going to be

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,720
about loan origination and collection

00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:56,960
um and that's you know talking about his

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,840
fintech company built on top of uh

00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,440
interact

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,760
so that's the rest of the day there's

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:05,840
quite a few other things on the schedule

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:08,840
um i think with that i will go ahead and

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:11,840
say thank you and enjoy the rest of the

00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,840
