With most of the projects showing negligible or no activity at all for about an year, the fineract-cn project looks so close to being looked upon as an abandoned beast. And because the difficulties one has to go through to tame this beast, not many people get to enjoy the real beauty it really is. With our work, we hope to make a difference to this current state of the project and to attract more people into getting to know the project and make contributions by making it easier for them so that we can steer the project towards a more mature, stable, complete and releasable version.
