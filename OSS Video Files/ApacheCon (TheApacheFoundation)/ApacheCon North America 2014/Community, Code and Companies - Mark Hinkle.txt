mmm rich said I worked for Citrix and

00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:07,649
normally when you sponsor a conference

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,349
they give you ten minutes to pitch your

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:13,620
product but that's not my style

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:16,980
what I want to really talk about is what

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,890
Citrix is found since coming to work

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,920
with the Apache Software Foundation so

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,890
two years ago this month we had code

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,840
called cloud stack that we donated to

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:32,130
the Apache Incubator and we started to

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,989
participate in Apache and obviously the

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,200
community is made up of individuals that

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,260
participate so there isn't really a

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,780
construct within the Pachi that worked

00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:44,969
for us to directly interact but I want

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,950
to tell you how we've what we found out

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:52,050
and what we can do to help interact and

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:54,390
make Patrick's is Festival I'm actually

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,789
Apache committer but you don't want my

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,379
kid it's not that good I do help out

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,899
with a lot of things around cloud stack

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,940
and help with other projects that Citrix

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:07,229
isn't interested in as well as spending

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:11,159
time with Linux Foundation when we first

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:12,990
came to Apache we had to learn what your

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,030
mission was which is to provide software

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,280
for the public good I think you guys do

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,409
it awesome job of that it's probably one

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,180
of the best software development

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:26,939
methodologies and open-source

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:28,650
proprietary software as a company we

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,710
have to act in best interest of our

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,380
shareholders and when we first started

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,070
interacting with patchy people looked at

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,070
us a little funny

00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:46,440
I bet you thought I was gonna show a

00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:47,910
different picture but when we came to

00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,740
Apache a lot of people looked at us a

00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,900
little suspiciously why is this company

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,720
want to come work with the Apache

00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:57,690
Software Foundation donate our resources

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,100
are they trying to control something so

00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,560
I thought it would be good to take this

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,200
time to talk about our intentions as a

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,060
company and how that's gonna be good for

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,370
us and be good for you as members of the

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:13,650
community we have some common ground and

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,210
that common ground is that we want to

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:22,110
develop great software for the public

00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:24,990
good and to make us successful we wanted

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,640
work one not differentiating features we

00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,340
want to walk work on features that don't

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,470
give us competitive advantage but are

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,110
very critical to the products that we

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:37,650
bring the market we work on things that

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:41,010
we want to get impact input from our

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,390
users so that we can develop products

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,270
and sell them because the end of the day

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:48,090
we are in business and we have

00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:51,150
shareholder responsibility we we don't

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,280
want to squander our resources doing

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,100
things that don't add value first our

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,560
shareholders we want to promote the core

00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,680
technology we work when Apache

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,010
CloudStack is one of our is the primary

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,930
project that we support and if that core

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,150
technology is good it provides the

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:12,900
foundation for us to sell our products

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:16,470
on top of that we want to build the

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:19,350
Apache brand if the Apache brand is

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,660
strong and our products are built on top

00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,730
of the Apaches prot that those software

00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,890
it's good for us it's the Good

00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,680
Housekeeping Seal of Approval people

00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,270
know and respect Apache fitfully they'll

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,130
respect our products because they know

00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:35,970
that we make good underlying software

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:37,890
choices the other thing that's very very

00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,959
important to us is that we build our

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:43,620
project brands we want people to know

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,330
that things like Apache Tomcat and top

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,690
patchy Hadoop and patchy cloud stack

00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:55,840
Apache Lib cloud are all high quality

00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:57,790
components of products that we make and

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,250
we want to improve relationships among

00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:03,490
like-minded people and I say that in a

00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:05,530
vague way but I would like the partners

00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,090
that I have to be able to work with

00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,580
Apache and understand that and

00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:12,240
understand the Apache way and add value

00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:16,620
to your organization or our organization

00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:19,390
as a committed I'm part of the team to

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,270
also charity is a big part of why the

00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:25,990
Apache foundation exists for the public

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:28,270
good a lot of companies have the idea of

00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,850
charitable giving so when you get on the

00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:34,090
highway and you say you know this mile

00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:36,420
was cleaned up by XYZ company that's

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:39,040
really cool but in the software world

00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:41,640
there's a good affinity for us to have

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,550
our software developers donate to

00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,660
open-source projects in a charitable way

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,940
some of the guys that work for me

00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,550
actually contribute to projects that

00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:55,720
have nothing to do with our products and

00:04:51,550 --> 00:05:01,690
services they just want to be good part

00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:04,090
good members of the community and we

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:06,100
also want to use build a user base for

00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,870
Apache projects that's one thing that I

00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,970
don't think we are exceptional about I

00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:13,240
think if I was going to do my steve

00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:15,370
ballmer monkey boy impression right now

00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,590
it's developers developers developers I

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,960
also want to see us have good affinity

00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:22,690
for users users users when you come to

00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,560
Apache project I want to see the Apache

00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:28,560
project be friendly to the non-technical

00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,560
community

00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:35,110
so this is what we'd like so normally

00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:39,460
this is a point where I give a product

00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:41,439
pitch but I don't have one today as a

00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,719
company I want to be able to come to

00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:46,509
Apache and provide resources and direct

00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:48,719
them to the projects I care about I am a

00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:50,319
we sponsor the Apache software as the

00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:53,020
foundation as a whole

00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,659
but for us in the long term I would like

00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:58,270
to see ways for us to sponsor the

00:05:55,659 --> 00:06:01,210
particular projects that we want make it

00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:03,759
easier right now we can provide

00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:07,979
resources around those projects but it's

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,979
not a formal part of the Apache way I

00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:14,830
want to be able to promote the brand of

00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:16,569
our project to the users and to press

00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,610
and to analysts because this is really

00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:20,740
important for adoption the way it works

00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,060
is you get lots and lots of users some

00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,610
of these users start giving you

00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:27,969
documentation providing patches build

00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:30,490
your developer base building users isn't

00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:32,349
important as building develop adding

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:38,830
developers because I think one begets

00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:40,900
the other I think it needs to make it

00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,779
easier for our business partners to get

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,659
involved so when we have partners that

00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:48,699
have resources like developers and money

00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:51,940
how can they get involved with Apache

00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:54,729
without bastardizing the process how can

00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:56,339
we unwrap more of these resources so

00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:59,020
they can help you build better software

00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:03,159
get better adoption make sure the batchi

00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:05,949
brands stay strong and that makes us all

00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:07,930
successful so how the used-car salesman

00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:10,509
era because I'm not trying to sell you

00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:12,849
anything cheap and sleazy I'm trying to

00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:15,849
tell you on how we can continue to be

00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:17,830
successful for Lex 15 years if anybody

00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:20,650
saw Greg Stein's talk last year at

00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:23,889
Apache con that was one of the messages

00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:26,379
in his talk was what are we gonna do to

00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:29,589
make sure Patchi stays strong it's had a

00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:32,969
great track record so far but we want to

00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:32,969
be long be around longer

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,470
these are the things I want to do these

00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,170
are the things I can help you with if

00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:43,540
you provide me a mechanism to do so we

00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:45,940
host events we have we have big fancy

00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:47,470
centers that we can do hackathons at or

00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,480
you can give tops and we do a lot of

00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:53,070
those in Silicon Valley and Santa Clara

00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,910
California our executive briefing center

00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:57,400
we've brought we create promotional

00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:59,170
giveaways I've given away probably a

00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,120
hundred thousand t-shirts in the last

00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:05,160
ten years for open source projects

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:08,280
promoting your brands and your projects

00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:11,560
well I'm not that good at coding

00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:14,320
I'm good with social media and PR I can

00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,460
help we have resources to help reach out

00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,330
to the people that are thought leaders

00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:21,010
in our space do that kind of thing

00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:26,080
provide travel scholarships when we have

00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:28,570
a event I'm happy to fund travel for key

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,380
committers to projects I care about but

00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:34,420
I need that mechanism to do so I hire

00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,790
interns this summer we're hiring interns

00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:38,920
to work on a patchy cloud stack they're

00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:40,810
going to be employed by Citrix and their

00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:43,990
only job is going to be to work with

00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:45,640
open source code they actually probably

00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:48,940
wouldn't even get into a Citrix office

00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:52,330
they're just gonna be writing some some

00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:54,460
interesting new features I want to help

00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:56,760
create goodwill for our projects so I

00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:59,020
want people to understand that

00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,820
volunteers in this organization or

00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,270
writing excellent code that's changing

00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,280
the world

00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:08,590
that touches billions of people every

00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:10,330
day if I know if I can do these things

00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,220
I'm talking about I can create more jobs

00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:14,320
for committers so that your day job can

00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,810
be working on your favorite project

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,530
whether it's a duper cloud stack or

00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:23,410
Delta cloud or Tomcat and I want to

00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:26,170
sponsor a s F and the SF events so

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:28,510
Citrix does sponsor the SF we sponsored

00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:31,090
this event will sponsor many more if I

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:35,590
have anything to say about it but I need

00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:38,290
it to be easy and I can ask the SF to do

00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:40,870
this but that's just one voice what I

00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:42,700
really want is you as a community if

00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:46,510
this is something that's appealing to

00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,330
you that you actually ask make yourself

00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:51,680
heard

00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:54,680
at the ASF word-level and so we can have

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,120
better kid you can put a little cat in

00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:02,779
any tech presentation and it works so

00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:05,390
this is really my specific ask I want

00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:07,790
you to as your p.m. see boards and

00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:10,459
committees make sure that you're telling

00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:15,500
the SF if you want this if not that's

00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:17,120
fine I hope you do want it I want to

00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,700
find a way for companies to work with

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,190
projects now I understand completely the

00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:24,579
ASF is individual out volunteers but I

00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:27,110
do want to make it possible for

00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:29,180
companies that come to the ASF to get

00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,680
the training they need so that they can

00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:36,170
be a good citizen and their employees

00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:39,950
can be a good citizen at the ASF if you

00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:41,810
ask for help from me as a sponsor just

00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:44,149
make it clear what you want and why I

00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:46,279
should care about it so I tried to tell

00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:48,290
you what I wanted today but if there's

00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:51,110
things I can do to make you successful I

00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:53,149
want you to tell me so I not that I have

00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,649
a big pile of money and back I have a

00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:57,100
little bit of money but I have a lot of

00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:59,839
resource that can make you successful

00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,279
and if I give you those resources I

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,020
think it's really really important that

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,540
you treat them the same way you treat

00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:08,240
your impersonal resources so if we when

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,640
people donate to your foundation make

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,500
sure that your you're doing your best to

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,880
make sure they get the value that they

00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:17,990
should receive for being a sponsor

00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:20,600
whether it's me or someone else so

00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:22,730
thanks for your time I hope you guys

00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,000
have a great Apache time and thanks for

00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,000
