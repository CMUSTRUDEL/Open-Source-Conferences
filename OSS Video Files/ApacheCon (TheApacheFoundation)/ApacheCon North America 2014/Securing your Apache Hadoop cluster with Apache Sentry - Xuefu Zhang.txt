thank you everyone good morning all

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,319
right with it well you know probably in

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:17,220
three meetings I were to see it I could

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:19,980
after all so let me get a slice so my

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:23,220
name is ships are and software engineer

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,980
from carretera so in the past few years

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:30,570
are helping and working mostly on up our

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:34,290
budget projects so I'm a PMC member for

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:38,040
Apache sentry in Apache high as well as

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:43,940
a commuter for Apache project but today

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:47,129
I'm going to talk about talking about a

00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:49,500
budget century especially how you may I

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:53,840
use it to secure to your heart of a

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:56,280
cluster here is the outline of my talk

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,710
so first of all I like to give you some

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,469
information about the background

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:06,600
information about why we created the

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:09,030
Apache century project then then we work

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,580
you I will give you some basically

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,909
information about the security concepts

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:17,280
in a context of for Hadoop ooh ecosystem

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:20,670
such as the authorization authentication

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,640
data protection and incredibly etc then

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,850
I were introduced formally introduce our

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,549
patch century telling you what's the

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,890
century in the centuries architecture

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,880
and how you may use the century in your

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:39,780
product and internally how sentry works

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:44,250
then I will lay out the roadmap for for

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:51,840
the short term for a budget century of

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:53,729
course a Q&A session at the end so as

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,170
you may notice the HUD has gained

00:01:53,729 --> 00:02:03,659
significant monumental in the past few

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:05,759
years so they can be saying in the

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,160
following aspects so today there are

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,819
more and more users or more enterprises

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,440
are used use are using and adopting

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,980
hadoop

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,710
they're mission-critical platform so we

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,450
see that the enterprise put him more in

00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:25,740
the more detail you sometimes including

00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:29,220
sensitive data our heart OPA cluster and

00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:31,260
also the data are exposed to more and

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,300
more users not just a few data

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:37,770
scientists in the you know enterprise

00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:42,800
but also to a bigger audience such as

00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:47,280
data analysts IT specialist or the

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:50,760
marketers et cetera so from all the use

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:54,660
cases that we see data warehouse offload

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:59,940
seems to be the most dominant use AG for

00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:01,440
Hadoop so why that's because traditional

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,700
data warehouse Ryan Delaware has an

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,420
important so that's where you gather

00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:08,280
your business insights whether the data

00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,620
traditional data warehouse is the talent

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,800
skill up to handle that did not warn me

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:17,160
that we are seeing especially if there's

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:20,489
alternatives such as a heart Hadoop so

00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:24,810
with that a lot of Hadoop tours are

00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:29,130
introduced such as a Hadoop Hadoop

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:32,760
Apache hi Apache trio and criteria

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:35,550
Impala people love those tours because

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:39,540
they provide familiar sequel interfaces

00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:44,489
I will see that secretory is a

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:46,230
phenomenal but there are this is our

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:50,550
continuous but there are problems as

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:52,709
well so what are the problems Enterprise

00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,980
right after deeply that sensitive data

00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:57,360
on a cluster do you want to protect the

00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:00,590
particular data they will want every

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,600
user has access to every piece of data

00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:06,330
in the same time there are regulations

00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:10,980
and the governance rules that require

00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:15,480
certain certain security measures to be

00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:17,850
taken these words there are examples

00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,530
like the compliance requirement such as

00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:25,590
HIPAA PCI PII and the FISMA

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:27,210
right under Preiser has done has a

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:31,800
responsibility to comply

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:35,639
with this roars but we know that Hadoop

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:39,330
is not it's not a startup with the

00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:42,030
security in the top priority but now

00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:45,180
with this earth created obscene security

00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,800
has become the top priority for for a

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:51,990
lot of components in your heart open

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,569
ecosystem human Afridi's effort we can

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,669
see that the different components

00:04:53,569 --> 00:05:01,139
provide the different security

00:04:55,669 --> 00:05:04,770
mechanisms what and the part of you

00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:06,210
Hadoop system we know that the same data

00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,360
may be accessed by different

00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:12,800
applications for example a table in high

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,440
with nothing but the directorial HDFS

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,050
but how is not the only application that

00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,169
a user can access the data for example

00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:25,229
you can use my hard jobs or you can use

00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:28,380
a Apache peak or H catalog to access the

00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:32,490
data so that's a maker the things are

00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:37,289
more complicated and since the Hadoop

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:39,360
was you know here went in I secured so I

00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:43,469
will see that how do we was born off for

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,419
trust not to not just security this

00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:48,030
worries that sounds familiar right so

00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:54,630
like a windows in the earlier stages we

00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:58,280
are security Tariq Aziz so now I'm

00:05:54,630 --> 00:06:01,349
giving you an interpreter introduction

00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:09,060
security concepts in the context for

00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:18,870
Hadoop so authentication is to identify

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:20,490
who you are so we have with the tried in

00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,820
front of who you are there are multiple

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:26,669
there for your alternatives so that you

00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:29,039
for coming from Hadoop is unsecured so

00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:31,919
what you can do it you can isolate your

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:37,380
network so that as I authorize the user

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:39,510
have no access to your cluster so and

00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,620
also it assumes that you know trust in

00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:44,730
your network I

00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:46,260
everybody is it's a trusted it's a good

00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,940
citizen they do whatever they are

00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:51,470
supposed to do and don't do things

00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:56,910
that's bad for the for the cluster and

00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:59,880
one previous um she you you this

00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:01,950
approach is that that who you are is

00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,110
actually determined by the current host

00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:08,970
which it's not an answered it's the same

00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:12,000
as a cluster well I give photos this is

00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,880
solution doesn't satisfy your need you

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,040
have the choice of strong authentication

00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:20,040
which it comes from leaders from leader

00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,230
in Hadoop now the curb OC is supported

00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:27,120
in your Hadoop you can use Kerberos to

00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:29,220
to to use a further authentication so

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,150
sometimes Enterprise would have

00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:35,820
preferred to use there you can see steam

00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:39,900
to user directory such as I aired up and

00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:41,760
active directories sometimes active

00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,340
directories some version of Active

00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,670
Directory is integrated away the kerbals

00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:53,670
so it'll provide a single point of truth

00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:55,710
for not just the enterprise but also for

00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:58,140
your Hadoop cluster so the enterprise

00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:01,830
and the cluster are integrated using the

00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:03,600
same authentication so tooth mixing is

00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:06,330
complicated when you have this

00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:09,150
authentication sometimes it's a benefit

00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:12,480
that you provide some convenience for

00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:17,400
the user by requiring and/or supporting

00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:22,380
single sign-on so it hurts more

00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,100
information about Kerberos first of

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,270
Kerberos

00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:29,130
suppose as a three way straws and Acacia

00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,780
either provide a mutual authentication

00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,420
between the service and the service

00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:36,270
users so not just a-- or sonic e the

00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:38,160
user to a service but also make sure the

00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:42,000
service is the right service that the

00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:45,120
user is trying to access because there's

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,460
a single point of truth about the user's

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:52,170
identity and all the service identity

00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:54,250
add a tack a TCK TCK distribution center

00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:57,279
for for

00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:03,070
in the protects against you could drop

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:05,860
me or replay attacks so so in yen

00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:08,680
carbo's so every user or service has a

00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:11,589
principle so it's a user principle or

00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:15,010
service principle so the credentials for

00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:18,130
the user it's it's you you're the user

00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:21,510
is a password or for a service is a key

00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:24,130
tab which actually contains the

00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:26,910
credentials such like a password or for

00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:29,440
the for the services

00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:32,500
so that's authentic Asian so

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:36,250
authorization is determining what you

00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:38,380
can do after being authenticated so it

00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:41,640
differences different components in you

00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:44,110
how to provides a different authentic

00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:50,430
authorization mechanisms for example

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:50,430
hdfs provide epoxies fire permission to

00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:57,100
to control fire access for example the

00:09:53,410 --> 00:10:00,880
hazard has this read write or execute

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:03,400
the permission on fire for you for the

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:07,980
user which is the owner or for the group

00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:11,560
or for the for the word everybody else

00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:14,410
and other components also provides

00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:17,830
authorization but such as a mark job

00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:22,950
cues can control who can launch an mr

00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:27,339
job each base also provides a sales

00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:30,010
table and the table and column family

00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:33,100
level the Cuban law provides a step

00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:37,209
further by providing cell our

00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:39,880
authorization so impersonation is

00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:44,800
another choice sometimes the system has

00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:46,600
no no means to to the authorization but

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,820
I eat amazing cos okay the ananias

00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,070
system may be able to determine what the

00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,760
user can't or cannot you so it'll

00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:58,060
employee in person you impersonate

00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:00,130
connecting user and as which that the

00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:03,880
underlying system we're to the right

00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:06,970
theme so

00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:10,449
data protection so this aspect of

00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:12,819
security is a perp it's a per to protect

00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:15,399
particular data you were here for the

00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:19,149
data is getting compromised I see you

00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:20,889
it's got a stolen or you was dropped so

00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:25,449
the new year means it's the eunuch

00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:27,339
regime so hard rope was so when we talk

00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:30,069
about creating that apprised true that

00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:32,829
they not not the data on the disk or you

00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:35,040
know as a file but also the data being

00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:38,680
translated such as the network

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:42,839
communications so Hadoop today already

00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:49,319
supports incredibly for data in transit

00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:52,480
for protocol such as RPC TTP HTTP etc or

00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:56,589
in the case of hi it is a supporting

00:11:52,480 --> 00:12:00,610
incredible scene for JDBC ODBC however

00:11:56,589 --> 00:12:02,380
hard to book has no native security for

00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,620
for the data and a rest

00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:11,800
so Hadoop HDFS there's no encryption

00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:16,689
it relies the OS level encryption Howard

00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:21,100
the canoes is there is activity rar HDFS

00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:23,470
six one three four which provides with

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,630
it's going to provide incredible chain

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,430
either

00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:33,160
for the further data proceed further

00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:38,110
HDFS files so stay tuned so the last

00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:42,160
aspect of security is common insanity

00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:43,839
so this as a backup is a true provided

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:48,189
security related

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:50,649
monitoring tracing or login so again you

00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:54,459
had open ecosystem it's implemented

00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:56,529
component to component for example HDFS

00:12:54,459 --> 00:13:02,139
and a MapReduce provide the basic

00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:04,540
auditing support for Apache hi the

00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:09,370
monitor records the usual interactions

00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:11,380
such as who when a word in it because

00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:16,449
those information in the you know melody

00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:17,590
restore Apache was a for as another

00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:19,300
example provides

00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:24,580
audition trailers for the service use

00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:31,000
ages so Nets next I'm formally

00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:33,040
introduced register entry so as we as we

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,810
discussed the previous so you can cease

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:40,150
the authentic authorization mechanism is

00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:43,630
fragmented in a coarse-grained and the

00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:48,370
manual so for example to share data

00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:50,890
between users so today mostly it can be

00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:54,940
done by changing the fire permissions to

00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:58,630
shared it yeah group for our for our

00:13:54,940 --> 00:14:01,270
users in within a group so that's very

00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:04,839
manual and it's of course greener you

00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:07,000
know share the whole file or or nothing

00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:08,650
so you for you sure you for your have a

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,600
Sami information you know file you want

00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:13,900
to share but not credit card numbers

00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:17,529
then they start just a doesn't work you

00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:22,510
know it's a manual because if you share

00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:25,900
among multiple groups so so we data so a

00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:27,580
lot of times it in order to get rid of

00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,290
this headache it you just say okay let's

00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,839
make the fire corroboree accessible to

00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:35,260
everyone so so a lot of times dinner

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:37,720
it's not a protected so from these

00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:41,130
problems we can see that all we all we

00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:45,700
need is is a centralized authorization

00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:49,450
mechanism that works across the across

00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:55,360
components with the ease of use and is a

00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:58,920
fine grain or or an agro based so what

00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:02,410
is this entry that's so central is the

00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:05,620
authorization module for high searching

00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:07,240
impala and beyond so it just it try to

00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:12,370
solve the problem that are we mention

00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:15,900
about either unlocks the key row based

00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:18,670
access control requirements such as

00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:22,450
security so it's a secure

00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:26,020
fine-grained and a row based with the

00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:28,800
multi-tenancy support so our budget

00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:30,940
century is open source it has been

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,090
incubating for the

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,790
for a year it has an ecosystem so

00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:38,830
support today

00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:41,890
centuries the Jews the Apache Solr

00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:44,710
for search or hives or two are you

00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:48,400
clattering Impala one dot awareness

00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:53,500
above so these are the benefits that are

00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:55,840
using party a century so it allows you

00:15:53,500 --> 00:16:00,910
to star sensitive data are you in the

00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:03,010
Hadoop in your heart up and with the

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:06,460
access control you can extend that your

00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:08,710
data to more users and I'll help you to

00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:13,660
comply the way to the regulations or

00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:15,940
governance capabilities these are the

00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:19,180
main convertibility you working with

00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:22,210
from from a century first of all is a

00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:24,970
fine-grained fine-grained ax it's a

00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:26,680
we've mentioned a previously sherry and

00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,410
fire is non-farm current is that a fire

00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:32,530
level either sure oh here the whole fire

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:34,960
or nothing but most of the time we want

00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:39,310
to have a more detail to control or

00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:42,550
finer control such as in sequel you want

00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:45,430
to control under on the server under DP

00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:50,980
or on the table or views or even further

00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:53,440
maybe under columns or role 'evil and in

00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:58,750
the context of search you may want to

00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:03,420
control the fine-grained control in

00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:06,760
taxes connections and it is row based so

00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:12,520
so we did role so you are thinking more

00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:14,350
about like the route she were functional

00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,470
role in your enterprise like an

00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:19,990
administrator or super user or the beta

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:22,150
Allen is right so you don't think about

00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,490
you see what who can access that this

00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:26,800
table who can trouble the other table so

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,660
it's a row based it that's the from your

00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:33,670
term for the traditional database

00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:39,210
management and it supports multi talents

00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:41,020
ease because so for example um for

00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,280
Yoshiko

00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,809
you should it appears you can have a

00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:47,809
separate the policy such that

00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:51,649
you can delegate the administration

00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:54,379
responsibility 22 to different animal

00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:57,070
chitters one for each of the DB so you

00:17:54,379 --> 00:18:02,840
so one guide on how to manage the whole

00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:06,679
whole databases or the databases so

00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:09,350
here's the architecture of Apache

00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:13,419
century so the core components is the

00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:16,070
policy engine in the middle so which is

00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:20,619
evaluate the policy rules that are you

00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:24,710
defined so on the top is a HD components

00:18:20,619 --> 00:18:26,779
it's the recorder is a DISA findings one

00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:29,929
for each external components so a

00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:33,220
binding can be considered as the

00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:35,899
authorization costs from the external

00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:40,960
external modules such as an Impala or

00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:44,779
high observer to a solar into a century

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:48,679
so requesting whether it is should have

00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:51,889
whether the request is is permitted and

00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:56,029
the other part of me is the policy

00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:58,999
provider so today they are fire

00:18:56,029 --> 00:19:00,909
priestess fire baseless story is

00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:03,289
supporting them so policy provider

00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:08,299
starts the policy rules that a user

00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:11,450
defined today we support fire base the

00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:14,210
storage but we'll there are working in

00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:16,460
progress for the database so user

00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:19,399
therapies as a storage for the policy

00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:22,340
rules so here is the half century works

00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:25,220
in your action in the context of a

00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:28,809
sequel as an example so let's see this

00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:32,210
is a high and high would request

00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:34,789
receives a query and the password of

00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:37,940
course it'll parses the theory and a

00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:42,639
validated a query against sequel grammar

00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:45,820
here is happy so it'll coat in a pewter

00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:48,350
stimulatory or abstract syntax tree

00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:51,679
they're aware concerns

00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:56,059
consult consult away the century it

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:58,580
which to check whether the stream and

00:19:56,059 --> 00:20:02,720
objects or like the table to be a

00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:03,919
as what are the actions so as

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,230
essentially whether it should have

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,500
proceeded so century returns back say

00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:14,840
guitar yes or no depends on the depends

00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:16,340
on the policies then I will proceed to

00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:20,000
to the next steps

00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:22,820
either execute the query or rejects the

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:28,789
query depends on the response from from

00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:32,110
century so these are the objects or

00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:37,100
actors that are involved in the

00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:39,289
evaluating century policy so user is the

00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:41,600
you of course is the user that trying to

00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:45,830
access the data your approval membership

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:48,260
so which groups the user user belong to

00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:50,409
and the resources of course it's the

00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:52,190
data that are to be protected and the

00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:57,019
privilege in the rules

00:20:52,190 --> 00:21:01,309
identity that's a the what operations is

00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:03,409
allowed for which II Richie objects or

00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:07,100
which the resources so let's look at the

00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:11,059
more on each so user as a reseller user

00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,510
is the the one who tries to access the

00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:15,950
data

00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:16,850
so when reaches we reach in century the

00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:22,340
user should have be already

00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:24,919
authenticated so users identity mostly

00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:27,590
is a sometimes it's a it's already in

00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:30,980
the second contacts so you don't have to

00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:34,850
find out or you don't have to do

00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:37,970
additional authentication for that so

00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:39,919
you look roopam membership is it is it

00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:43,909
most most of the time is defining

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:45,769
outside the century policy so because

00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:49,850
the most of the enterprise has already a

00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:52,190
center Center user directory so you can

00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:54,620
obtain this user membership from this

00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:57,919
user directories such as a dev or Active

00:21:54,620 --> 00:22:04,970
Directory or you can get the membership

00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:06,500
from HDFS sometimes the membership or

00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:10,639
may be available from the session

00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,840
contacts depending on the application so

00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:14,430
resources are they

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:17,700
most of that time is the data to be

00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:22,980
protected such as a file or directory

00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:29,670
yeah HDFS or a table vo in hive or uii

00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:33,570
or or the collections or or indexes the

00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:34,850
firm for solar so resources that can be

00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:39,540
you hear Akiko

00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:43,970
so most um needs are hierarchical so pre

00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:49,260
vdg privilege it defines operation for

00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:53,070
resources so such as you select a

00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:59,280
payment table or view or drop drop a

00:22:53,070 --> 00:23:01,470
table or create a table and RTP so

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,490
here's a the lower part is like example

00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:07,740
of for how you would have defined

00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:12,390
privilege in century so on the left side

00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:15,600
of the arrow HD the resources that that

00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:18,720
this is a privilege is about for example

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,780
it's a connection in the customer

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,670
connection and the action is a query so

00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:27,690
whoever has this probability will be

00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:33,420
able to clear it is this customer

00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:38,040
connection so rules rules is a

00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:42,330
connection of privileges so electrifying

00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:44,960
the unit's entry policy so for you it

00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:47,400
for example if you're defining a

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,910
superuser rule so it should have

00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,860
included all the privileges to fall for

00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:56,580
this for the user to achieve as a

00:23:52,860 --> 00:24:00,800
functional functional rule in the

00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:04,200
enterprise but for for the attesting

00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:06,720
rule right it may not have a may not

00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:09,390
need order privilege so Adam a probably

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,360
just needed a sufficient rules to to

00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:14,760
achieve for the testing purposes here is

00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:18,780
how you how you would define rules in

00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:21,600
century so on the left side Africa

00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:26,450
cosine is this row and on the right side

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,450
eyes are leased out for privileges

00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:35,310
so grouper room membership that's thus

00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:37,890
the most important components the game

00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:40,650
in century yes century that's where you

00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:43,260
your assign privileges or assign rules

00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:47,280
to a group not a tweet individual user

00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:49,680
brought to a to a group of users so so

00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:52,470
by how it is in never of interaction on

00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:54,570
the other side for the judo group or on

00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:58,580
the other side as I run a research site

00:24:54,570 --> 00:25:01,400
there's on a priority design you have a

00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:04,140
row would have provide greater

00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:08,670
flexibility to defer to assign

00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:10,980
privileges to users certainly is for a

00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:14,580
group you can have many one where are

00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:19,410
many many rows here are the some

00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:22,080
examples analyst group as a jeweler

00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:25,650
group can have an disappear every row or

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:28,140
analysts updated role for a ministry

00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:30,120
timing it I mean how are the rows but

00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:37,400
for the task group Amy maybe only

00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:42,030
require the tester row so this is how

00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:44,340
this is how sentry evaluated when well

00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:47,130
request comes highly evaluate against

00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:49,140
the rule so it will find out who is the

00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:52,020
user that's the current of you that are

00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:54,660
trying to access what's the what's the

00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:58,020
users that the user Palance true

00:25:54,660 --> 00:26:00,090
and what a resource is the user is

00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:02,520
trying to access and how is the

00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:06,540
resources access its a read or read a

00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:09,590
file or silicon table et cetera they're

00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:13,680
in word the main question is whether

00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:16,500
does that any of the users group has the

00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:19,470
has a row that has the right privilege

00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:23,780
if for this operation so if the answer

00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:26,700
is yes then quit go go ahead so send

00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,590
otherwise they'd say okay sorry you

00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,670
don't have the right appropriate or

00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,670
sufficient a privilege

00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:42,170
so um so while the century has been

00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:45,010
incubated here for close to one year but

00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:47,870
um I know there's a lot of works that

00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:52,400
that's on the roadmap we like to improve

00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:55,730
this improve how some improve centuries

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:59,030
the capability so this is the list of

00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:01,280
things we like to do in the near term we

00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:03,530
certainly like to introduce century to

00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:07,070
more hard to components for their

00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:10,040
authorization needs so and also we like

00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:11,990
to have a centralized policy store for

00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,250
the whole enterprise today we kind of

00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:15,830
helped this file

00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:18,590
firebase the policy store which is quite

00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:21,530
a limited so we like to have like a DB

00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:26,590
based policy store that you can access

00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:29,690
over the network or order over the web

00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:31,760
and we like to have the online grant and

00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:34,010
revoke operation with it which we don't

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,110
have it right today today what do you

00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:38,060
will do you will go there and open the

00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:42,950
file and add it so it's quite

00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:44,870
inconvenient so we like to provide grant

00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:47,810
or revoke like a traditional what the

00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:50,420
traditional database would do so this is

00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:53,900
already working in progress and the last

00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:55,760
thing I think is more importantly is we

00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:58,550
like to provide a centralized the

00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:01,370
authorization service for all protected

00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:05,570
resources not just the data but also

00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:08,930
metadata or services certainly we need

00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:11,930
your contribution and support your

00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:14,840
support your supporter can comes from by

00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:18,520
using the product the projects that's

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:23,780
already has a century such as a hive or

00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:25,370
organ Paulo or or Apache Solr but you

00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:29,540
may also go a step further by

00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:32,210
introducing a purchase entry into the

00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:35,900
projects that you are working on so we

00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:37,840
really appreciate that you appreciate

00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:41,030
your help

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,570
so I think that's all I have any

00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,570
questions

00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:49,050
yes

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:59,519
hi suppose we have a HTTP front-end

00:28:55,379 --> 00:29:06,289
sitting on top of Hadoop hive and so on

00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:09,979
how can we link HTTP principle to

00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:14,070
exactly principle

00:29:09,979 --> 00:29:16,219
so suppose we have HTTP front-end right

00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:19,769
HTTP application sitting on top of

00:29:16,219 --> 00:29:22,679
Hadoop based applications all right so

00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:26,419
I'd like to know I have some ideas on

00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:31,409
how to have HTTP authenticated principle

00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:32,940
link to its entry authenticated

00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:34,710
principle if you not I mean there are

00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,599
some work needs to be done for that to

00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,989
happen or do it provide some support for

00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:39,210
it

00:29:36,989 --> 00:29:41,519
sure so I think that the question is

00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:45,299
whether you forty-year the requests are

00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:46,529
coming from HTTP so how eccentric and

00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:50,099
happy in that aspect

00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:54,269
so today actually so it depends on the

00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:56,940
components so today actually lets you in

00:29:54,269 --> 00:30:02,940
your hive it's already supported at UK

00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:05,669
for HTTP requests you already support us

00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,830
and occasion an authorization so

00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:09,960
suddenly I mean the request can only

00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:13,559
have this the user site and it you know

00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:16,259
it's a it's a credential so once it

00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:18,629
reaches the highway they can use that

00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:23,489
information to make authorization

00:30:18,629 --> 00:30:25,529
decisions so I would say for for

00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:30,119
components that a century is supported

00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:32,460
you were carried automatically the this

00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:36,119
century the capability for authorization

00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:40,489
but for for the authentication parties

00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:40,489
really it depends on the component

00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:52,700
what would it take to apply century

00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:55,610
authorisation strategies to other maybe

00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:58,880
even non hadoop components like Apache

00:30:55,610 --> 00:31:01,910
mesas which run can run on top of HDFS

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,670
could you use century to apply that kind

00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:08,900
of authorization rules to HDFS through

00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:13,130
mesas for example sure so I think you

00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:14,900
for get back to that diagram so so the

00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:17,900
question is that what what does it take

00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:22,130
to use the century yeah you know project

00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:25,460
that's an outsider for HDFS so where we

00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:29,330
my talk is mostly about how you use the

00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:32,090
century in the heart open ecosystem but

00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:34,040
it's done how to be so this is a suit

00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:38,690
here as we see there there's not much

00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:41,420
that's a cent is it's about the how to

00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:45,710
preserve a safe okay so what are you

00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:47,270
need to do is so you needed to first of

00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:49,790
all you needed to have a binding air

00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:51,650
that's at the point in air to basically

00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:54,080
you in your in your project and you

00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:57,790
needed to make a cause to century so

00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:00,580
today's century isn't it's a library so

00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:03,380
that you can include in your project so

00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:05,330
so you you're in your project you can

00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:08,750
make it those the authorization costs

00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:10,660
into the into a century when when when

00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:12,740
you need to make authorization decision

00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:14,720
so that's the first thing that you need

00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:17,660
to do it so you need to provide the

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,780
hooks to hook hook hook up with the

00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:22,910
centuries library so secondly you

00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:25,340
wouldn't need to define your rules so

00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:28,340
that rules today it's just a policy file

00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:30,950
but a later on you me how women have a

00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:33,820
teen up in store where you start these

00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:37,430
studies arose and also you can use a

00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:40,010
grant and revoke to manipulate this rose

00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:42,530
so that's the two things I see that you

00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:46,960
needed to do to support any any

00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:46,960
application yes

00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:56,420
that is my question so the question is

00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:58,850
of whether the the pioneer is a Oni Java

00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:03,590
I were saying yesterday they're the only

00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:06,560
only the api's are only only in Java but

00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:09,320
I think if there's an either way we like

00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,730
to put this in our roadmap to support

00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:18,200
other components which are not a

00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:21,560
java-based I have a continued question

00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,750
as well so is abiding layer of fat layer

00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:27,950
I mean for example if I want to

00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:31,610
implement some the body layer for pig is

00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:32,570
there a lot of effort I need to take no

00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,180
actually

00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:38,030
so the pathogen is a how complicated

00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:42,800
it's the binding air so I would say it's

00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:45,500
just a it's just a few matter across so

00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:48,700
today's a it's a it century it's a

00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:50,990
library so there are for Demetria API so

00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:53,360
when you make a server ization what do

00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:57,650
you need to provide who is the current

00:33:53,360 --> 00:34:00,290
user and what's the resources that the

00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:02,780
user is trying to access and what

00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:06,410
operation is what what kind of operation

00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:11,179
it is with this RDC information it's

00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:15,350
just a rip returned your yes or no so

00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:17,720
it's quite a simple I think it was kind

00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:19,280
of complicated is when you have the

00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,470
different applications that you're

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,649
trying to access the same data where

00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:27,800
they say highway the security but a pig

00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:30,620
is not secured so thank you I mean

00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,860
also what's the security of me you took

00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:35,090
me bypass the one who which is a

00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:40,130
security part of to use the one which

00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:43,040
are not such as an mrjoe so to give you

00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:45,860
further insights about this point in a

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:49,040
year so right now as I said is right now

00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:53,120
in the Java but we click we make think

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:55,580
of to provide other API or as I laid out

00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,230
on the on the roadmap we might have

00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:01,240
provided some services and which

00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:06,869
provides the service API to decouple the

00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:15,869
just the authorization colors from the

00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:15,869
authorization module yourself Christians

00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,910
how are the resources defined are they

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:25,510
discovered or are they actually kind of

00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:28,059
implementable by a user so the president

00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:29,980
is how the resource is defined so that

00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:32,559
today's it's not automatically

00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:38,500
discovered it's actually user defined in

00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:40,569
a policy so you so you you were in the

00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:46,420
policy you actually needed to specify

00:35:40,569 --> 00:35:50,500
your resources like from server to db2

00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:52,779
table century it's a neutral tradition

00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:55,270
he doesn't understand it's a theoretical

00:35:52,779 --> 00:35:59,940
concept so you define the hierarchy you

00:35:55,270 --> 00:36:03,450
define these objects and you use these

00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:10,420
objects that the resources in your

00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:14,049
privilege or the roles I have one

00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:16,920
actually two questions first is you

00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:21,910
mentioned that century is essential

00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:24,039
authorization components can you explain

00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:26,640
what is being managed

00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:30,010
essentially you mentioned that centric

00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:33,490
currently it's a library so where those

00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:37,059
policy are enforced it said actually in

00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:39,700
the execution path of individual

00:36:37,059 --> 00:36:43,289
components when user access it so this

00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:45,430
is the first question the second one is

00:36:43,289 --> 00:36:48,880
what is the coupling featuring the

00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:53,140
authentication and authorization for

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:56,940
example if I have web portal the user

00:36:53,140 --> 00:37:00,099
has already being a locking or sonicated

00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:03,520
but later on when it when they access a

00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:07,950
new system whether this authorization

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:11,829
century can actually accept already

00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:14,920
authenticated token or credential so

00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:17,829
that's it's basically integration with

00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:19,990
sonication tuning whether it's a

00:37:17,829 --> 00:37:22,359
stand-up is like us or something like

00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:25,630
that and you can walk with solder you

00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:28,960
know waverly web babel layer so two

00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:31,150
questions sorry for that so the question

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,980
has a new repeat alarm but let me start

00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:36,789
with the second question so you're

00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:39,039
asking what's the difference between

00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:40,890
authentication and authorization is that

00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:44,140
your question

00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:46,569
actually now it's how do you integrate

00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:49,869
the two things together I mean whether

00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:52,269
or sonication can be separated like we

00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:55,029
can use a web portal already

00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:57,730
authenticate a user then when century

00:37:55,029 --> 00:38:00,250
can accept that already authenticated

00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:03,130
token or a credential you know coming on

00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:06,789
with you know authorize your business so

00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:09,130
okay okay so so actually Sentra is not

00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:11,650
for authentication so it doesn't really

00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:14,640
care about our syndication so it's a it

00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:18,609
assumes that when the request comes true

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:23,319
century the user must be authenticated

00:38:18,609 --> 00:38:26,170
by previously by any any any modules for

00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:29,380
example our tap or you use Apollo that

00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:31,900
are your mention so so central assume is

00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:35,049
that it assumed what the user is

00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:38,559
authenticated or needed to is it's true

00:38:35,049 --> 00:38:40,990
check the users identity and find a

00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:43,299
membership group or membership in the

00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:45,480
energy by do this against the policy

00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:48,809
that to the user defined so

00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:50,440
authentication is out of outside of the

00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:56,700
aperture sentry

00:38:50,440 --> 00:39:02,980
so your first question is can use sorry

00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:05,650
expiry the central word other policy so

00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:08,019
maintained were when during runtime were

00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:10,809
the enforcement are actually happening

00:39:08,019 --> 00:39:12,279
it's all century essentially managed as

00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:16,329
well then probably you have this

00:39:12,279 --> 00:39:20,559
capability or performance EC's okay sure

00:39:16,329 --> 00:39:24,940
so today I suggest the question is so

00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:26,980
when I see sent century is it's a

00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,530
central authentication module so what

00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:33,240
are pi mean that

00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:34,770
what I mean by that is that so centrist

00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:39,090
it's the single place where are you

00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:41,190
defying all your policy rules and in the

00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:44,840
run time evaluation actually happens and

00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:47,280
each individual module so there's no

00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:50,100
skill appear to usual right because of

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,750
your application is it's the thing you

00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:57,300
are running so it is just to make a

00:39:51,750 --> 00:40:02,940
additional MasterCard into a library so

00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:05,040
this is what it is today you to the

00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:08,910
master course but in the future we may

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:11,730
consider as I did out in the roadmap is

00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:14,610
that we might provide some service where

00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:17,310
you don't you don't make a master

00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:19,770
carpenter you make a service card into

00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:21,810
some service running standalone so at

00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:24,810
that time there maybe there are

00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:28,950
scalability issues but I think we can

00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:31,050
address that at that time so my my

00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:32,790
thought and that it would be women can

00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:35,220
provide a sample because this is a

00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:37,140
authorization there's not a much

00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:39,390
computation it's just I have this bunch

00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:42,600
of rules and you get all the information

00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:46,590
your answer saying yes or no so we can

00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:52,730
provide a service with some instances

00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:55,380
such as a service like group zookeeper

00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:57,360
yeah and like I drew caper right so it

00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:01,110
all everything is strong in memory and

00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:04,140
it can see a bunch of for servicing

00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:08,060
instances and so that I would think I

00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:08,060
can solve with a secure PRG problem

00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,280
questions

00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:22,599
we are a lot of time for questions okay

00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:22,599
