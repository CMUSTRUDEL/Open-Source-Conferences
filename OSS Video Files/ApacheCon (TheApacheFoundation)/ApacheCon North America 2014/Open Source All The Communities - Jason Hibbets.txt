really excited to be here at Apache con

00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:08,069
and it's great to meet some of the

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,599
community members and and kind of

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,469
experience what you guys do here at

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:17,100
Apache at Apache con so I know I'm

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:18,480
standing between you and the beer I'm

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,279
also standing between you and the key

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,330
signing so i'm going to say my piece and

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,820
then we're going to get on with the rest

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,760
of the day so let's go ahead and get

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,859
started my mission for the last three

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,810
years has been to improve the citizen

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,830
experience and I know that could mean a

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,600
lot of different things to all at

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,329
different people but for me that means

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,520
creating citizen opportunities for

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,140
citizen engagement creating ways that

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,670
people can agree engage with the

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,059
government that a lot of us have become

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,170
unengaged with over the last few years

00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:49,410
so my story begins in Raleigh North

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,600
Carolina and I found a very interesting

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,059
way to blend my passions my passion for

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,039
open source my passion for civic

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,750
participation and my passion for my

00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,399
local community and that came in the

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:04,290
form of the open government and open

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:06,119
data movements thankfully open source is

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,240
at the root of all this open source is

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:12,299
part of my DNA i've been i've been at

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,430
Red Hat for over a decade I am I love

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,189
open source it's but it's part of my

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,659
passion the interesting that I get to

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:20,460
explain what open sources to a lot of

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,930
people who are not technical and when

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,340
you can see the gear start turning and

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,600
see the light bulbs going off that they

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,180
can understand the power of the

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,350
open-source way it really really makes

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,409
me feel good and really makes me feel

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,090
good that they can understand what a

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,360
popular development model can be applied

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,400
to other things so open is better right

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,470
I think almost everyone in this room

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,470
would agree with that but why is it

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,619
better it's because of the open source

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,729
model of participation that we have and

00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:49,649
promise you that Allison and I did not

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:51,899
coordinate our slides we're completely

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,570
isolated from from preparing for this

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,130
right so we were we're great with

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,579
transparency right we're transparent

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:03,540
with our source code with our their bugs

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:04,740
with our features we give out road map

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,530
so that people know the direction that

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,209
the projects are going in we collaborate

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,400
we have a variety of tools for

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,620
collaboration we use github for social

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,720
programming we have wikis

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,659
eat their pads we still collaborate over

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,940
email it's very effective most of the

00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:23,700
time we collaborate in person at

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,349
conferences like this it's all really

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,849
about participation right this is the

00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:28,440
whole scratching your own itch part

00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:31,950
right this is how a lot of open source

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,720
projects start there's a need you find

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:41,549
some people that have a similar need and

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:43,230
you go for and you create a project i'm

00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:45,360
not getting there we go one of my

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,560
favorites is rapid prototyping right

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,079
this concept of releasing early

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,470
releasing often the idea that we're

00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:53,810
contributing code to rawhide every day

00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:56,940
what did someone say earlier this week

00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:59,519
violent feedback loops right we get

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,129
almost instantaneous feedback on whether

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,590
our code is good or bad another way that

00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:06,690
I think about this is failing faster

00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,069
right if we can fail faster we can find

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,519
the code that works we can find the

00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:15,599
right path to success and then we have

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,579
governance the idea is that the best

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,099
code will rise to the top the best ideas

00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:22,950
will win is really fundamental to how a

00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:25,940
lot of our projects work and then the

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:28,290
secret agree to open source is passion I

00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,030
would imagine that everyone here is

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,859
extremely passionate about the projects

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,230
that they work on and that's why you do

00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:37,049
it sometimes it's great that we get paid

00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:39,299
to do it but it's it's also great that

00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:41,879
we have this this inner passion that

00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:45,389
really drives us to to provide to our

00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:48,180
communities and so transparency creates

00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:49,680
accountability participation you know

00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,889
with more I saw bugs or shallow allows

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,989
us to to innovate faster and passion

00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:59,280
creates commitment this is why open is a

00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:02,340
better way I can I bundle all these

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,139
terms together in a kind of much like

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,669
the Apache way called the open-source

00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:06,989
way when you think about all the

00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:09,449
successful pieces of the open-source

00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:11,400
development model rapid prototyping

00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:13,680
participation community knowledge

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,180
sharing that's the open-source way and

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,459
when you can take the open-source way

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,739
and apply it to other disciplines that's

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,770
really powerful and so I get to do this

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:25,169
every day with my job at open source com

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,640
we if you're not familiar with us we're

00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:27,990
an online publication and community

00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,190
highlighting how

00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,139
able source weight can be applied to

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,599
different things like business education

00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:41,490
and government and that's what I'm going

00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:43,349
to talk to you today about applying the

00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,229
open-source way outside of technology

00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:47,789
this is a great example of taking what

00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:50,520
we know from the world of coding and

00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:53,610
applying it to something that impacts us

00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:56,340
every day I would imagine that most of

00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,470
you think government looks like this you

00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,449
put taxes in and you get services out

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:03,060
governments create roads they build

00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:06,449
schools they collect our garbage or

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,310
recycling and a lot of us have feel like

00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:10,650
we can't influence some of the decisions

00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,389
that our governments make for us but we

00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:15,710
can and i hope i'm going to share some

00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:18,770
examples of how we can do that today and

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:21,060
again going back to my mission changing

00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:22,860
improving the citizen experience this is

00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,840
all about engagement this is all about

00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,090
how we can take things that we know and

00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,340
love every day and influence them with

00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,889
our governments so i'm going to start at

00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,349
the federal level here briefly when

00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:35,520
President Obama first took office his

00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:37,050
administration released the open

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,169
government initiative and you'll see

00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,430
I've underlined three key words here

00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:43,440
transparency participation and

00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,599
collaboration they should sound very

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,849
familiar to us this is a direct play

00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:50,009
from the open-source playbook I don't

00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:52,380
have a problem with that by the way and

00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm really excited that the open

00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,979
government movement is largely based on

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,740
the principles and philosophy that we

00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:01,380
know an open-source last year the

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,880
administration released the this

00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,979
executive order which I call the default

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,380
to open it basically mandates that any

00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:09,539
agency that's producing data should

00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,550
produce data in an open and

00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:14,039
machine-readable format not only for

00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:16,139
other agencies to consume but for us as

00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:19,110
citizens to consume and for the industry

00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,759
to consume as well the great examples oh

00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,909
here all the time are the fact that the

00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,710
US government has the GPS and the

00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:27,479
weather data available there are entire

00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,370
ecosystems that have developed around

00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:32,909
those technologies because they're free

00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:34,650
and they're open so I want to tell you a

00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:36,659
little bit about my my personal story

00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:39,000
and how I got involved again the

00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:40,919
blending of my three passions one of the

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,639
first things that I got to do was an

00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:44,069
interview with

00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,020
former raleigh mayor charles Meeker I

00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:47,969
went to his office sat down and we

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,009
talked about applying the open-source

00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:52,889
away open-source philosophy to a living

00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:54,990
and breathing city he talks really fast

00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:56,909
and i'm a slow typer and i didn't have a

00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,490
recorder but it worked out pretty well I

00:06:56,909 --> 00:07:01,740
was able to publish this interview on a

00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,240
platform that I have access to and a

00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,419
weird thing happened after that that I

00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:09,060
didn't expect a community started to

00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:11,129
form around this I had people contact me

00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,419
said Jason I want to get involved what

00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:15,150
are some things that we can do together

00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:16,919
to improve the citizen experience to

00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:19,199
understand how we can take open source

00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,969
and apply it to our city we started

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,949
talking about this idea of branding a

00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:24,120
city as the what would an open-source

00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:26,689
city looked like what are the principles

00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,039
of an uber sore city and what would they

00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:33,599
how could they impact kind of normal

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:36,990
everyday citizens the catalyst for us

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,060
was an event called city camp it's an

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,469
international unconference series that's

00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,379
designed to bring open source and

00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:45,210
technology to local municipalities so

00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,560
I've run three city camps i'm actually

00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,270
in the middle of planning a fourth one

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,710
I've had the opportunity to attend

00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,810
several city camps across the United

00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:55,289
States I've been to City camps here in

00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:56,699
Denver Colorado I in Kansas City the

00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:57,949
both the Kansas City's together because

00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,149
that's how they do it out there and

00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:01,949
Honolulu don't ask me how I got my

00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:05,699
manager to approve that expense report

00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:07,740
but it was great so if you're not

00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:09,240
familiar with a city campus an

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,039
unconference and obviously you guys have

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,409
an unconference tomorrow but for those

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,360
unfamiliar with it it's basically where

00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,649
the organizers plan to place the time to

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,029
logistics the food the parking

00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:20,430
everything like that the only thing we

00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:22,050
don't plan is the agenda and so we plan

00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:28,199
the agenda based on the people who show

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:29,819
up and participate the a group of

00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,919
volunteers came together these these

00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:33,990
people plan the first city camp in

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,190
raleigh there's actually been city camps

00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,800
held all over the world by the way so

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,149
it's not just here in the US none of

00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,140
these folks got paid to do it they're

00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:42,089
all doing it because they're passionate

00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,959
about our mission and what we want to

00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:48,870
accomplish and for basically over the

00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:50,819
course of 12 weeks we got together we

00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,769
form different committees we formed a

00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:54,990
logistics committee speaker committee a

00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:55,350
marketing committee and we planned an

00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,120
event

00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,340
we planned a nun comprehend sounds kind

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,000
of weird doesn't it and this is kind of

00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,470
what it looked like we we basically kind

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,230
of a hybrid model we had some plans

00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,220
speaking opportunities at the beginning

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:10,740
usually a business panel in a government

00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,210
panel they basically kind of gave us the

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,230
lay of the land told us what was

00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,460
happening in government what was

00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,200
happening in business and provided

00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,060
inspiration for the next part which was

00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,610
the unconference you know we're getting

00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:23,010
together on a Saturday morning getting

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,360
coffee getting bagels and and everyone's

00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,820
doing their pitches right so everyone

00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,710
gets up who has an idea they get 60

00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,300
seconds and then we you know this is

00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,400
very low-tech this is construction paper

00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,920
tape and markers people get they pitch

00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,320
their idea they the ideas get voted on

00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,890
and then we basically make the agenda on

00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:45,660
the fly and we proceed one of the

00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:47,820
results from our city camp was was a

00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,620
project called triangle wiki it's based

00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,330
on the open source project local wiki

00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,620
and basically you can think about it as

00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:57,330
a hyper local version of Wikipedia it

00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:58,560
basically allows people to do to share

00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,790
knowledge of their local community

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,800
whether it's your favorite restaurant

00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,090
your favorite running trail or maybe

00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,300
some history that you just don't want to

00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:07,950
be lost in your area so we started

00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,590
building community around this idea of

00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:12,530
having a regional wiki for the our area

00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:15,180
in North Carolina and this is what our

00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:18,090
community building looked like 50 people

00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:21,660
to city councilors our planning director

00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:24,450
on a cold februari Saturday morning got

00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,610
together and we basically gave them a

00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,350
wiki 101 class and empower them to

00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:33,180
create pages and to share knowledge and

00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:35,250
these this is what we did 600 pages 100

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,260
maps hundred new photos in about four

00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,300
hours with really the only motivation

00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:43,800
being passion and a food truck that was

00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:45,840
coming at lunch one of our other

00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:49,260
successful pieces was an application

00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,810
called our Greenway the pitch went

00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,460
something like this is basically a

00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:55,920
Raleigh mom got up on got up and made

00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,420
her 60 second pitch and she goes hey how

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,160
many people use the Greenway system here

00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,360
in Raleigh and the Greenway system in

00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,890
raleigh is basically our multi-purpose

00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,330
path system that connects all of our

00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:05,390
parks together i think there's about a

00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:08,040
hundred miles or so of those trails and

00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,769
you know about half the rooms hands went

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,300
up

00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:12,040
so how many people get lost on the

00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,749
greenway system in raleigh and more

00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,860
hands went up the second time because i

00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:16,300
think people realize that they'd

00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,980
probably use a green way and they

00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,269
probably got stuck right there's not a

00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,679
lot of signage so when you get to the

00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:22,959
end of a trail it doesn't really tell

00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:25,509
you hey go left 50 feet to get to the

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,239
next one the really cool thing about

00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:29,980
this app is that this was this this was

00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:31,329
born at City camp no one came in with

00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,769
this preconceived notion that we were

00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:36,069
going to build an application that

00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:37,360
integrated city data city maps they also

00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:38,799
integrated an application called

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,139
SeeClickFix which I'll talk about

00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,670
shortly and weather alerts so that if

00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:44,949
you're on the trail system they use the

00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:47,439
GPS stuff to alert your phone if there's

00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:48,429
severe weather coming now I doubt that

00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:51,579
the City of Raleigh would pay a

00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:53,199
developer to actually code this app this

00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:55,239
is a great testament that citizens can

00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:57,220
come together leverage data that's

00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:58,509
available from government and fulfill

00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,689
their own need without assistance from

00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:02,980
the government the cool thing is is that

00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:05,860
this app has continued to develop

00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,179
afterwards they've after the city camp

00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,489
they've still get together on a frequent

00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:11,079
basis they still add new features and

00:12:09,489 --> 00:12:13,059
they're adding new maps from cities

00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:14,649
around the around the area for us

00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:16,089
they're going to have to rename it our

00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:19,990
green way to triangle Greenway or

00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:22,299
something like that okay so so we've had

00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,129
huge accessible City camp but we we

00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:26,559
needed to evolve it to help but to grow

00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:28,869
and help accomplish new things so in our

00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:31,449
third year we rebranded city cam prolly

00:12:28,869 --> 00:12:33,490
a city camp North Carolina we love our

00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:35,350
city but we also felt that our state has

00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,990
some other challenges that we could help

00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,519
solve we also saw that there were some

00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,350
really powerful things happening in the

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,999
course of a weekend and we wanted to

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,799
stretch out those successes throughout

00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:46,420
the course of the year so we partnered

00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:49,600
with an organization called Code for

00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:51,579
America coach America is a non-profit

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,679
out of San Francisco California whose

00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:56,439
mission is to basically empower citizens

00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:58,499
and residents and governments to use

00:12:56,439 --> 00:13:01,029
technology for community problem solving

00:12:58,499 --> 00:13:02,799
they have a couple programs that do this

00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:05,350
the first program is a fellowship

00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:07,239
program basically cities apply for this

00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,069
fellowship program and they send a team

00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:11,019
of developers and designers to code an

00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:13,779
open source app for that city and I'll

00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:14,799
give you some examples in a moment the

00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:16,749
other program that they have is a

00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:19,769
brigade program it's basically a way to

00:13:16,749 --> 00:13:21,939
organize volunteers to do civic hacking

00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:22,270
whatever frequency they want to do that

00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:25,090
in

00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:26,950
our our areas meet on a monthly basis

00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:29,170
there are other areas that meet on a

00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:31,210
weekly basis every Tuesday night Oakland

00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:34,120
gets together and they do civic hacking

00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:35,620
in city hall at six o'clock and there's

00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,080
other places around the u.s. that are

00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,690
doing that as well so we named our

00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,370
brigade code for Raleigh one of the

00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,660
first things we did was we participated

00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,210
in a campaign from Code for America

00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,980
called race for reuse if any of you have

00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:50,170
been to hackathons before participate in

00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:52,540
a campaign like this a lot of them are

00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,760
trying to produce new applications well

00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,620
the whole purpose of this campaign was

00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:59,160
to reuse existing open source

00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,660
applications sounds crazy doesn't it

00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,000
they had selected a bunch of different

00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,290
projects one of them was local wiki for

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,850
us we had already done that so we

00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,830
checked the box on that there was

00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:11,020
another application called textus in

00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:13,540
which basically allows governments to do

00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:15,070
SMS polling with citizens to get them

00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,750
engaged on their mobile phone and to

00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:20,700
gather feedback in a different kind of

00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:23,320
way we chose to do the adopt application

00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:26,080
adopt to started in Boston as adopt a

00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,190
fire hydrant why in the world would

00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,280
somebody want to adopt a fire hydrant

00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,780
you may ask apparently when they snow

00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:35,020
and get iced on and they're not cleared

00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:36,610
out they're not very useful so at the

00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,320
city of the city Boston was part of this

00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,480
fellowship program and they coded this

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,180
adopt a fire hydrant just like you would

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,390
adopt a road or adopt a highway or adopt

00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:48,550
a stream for cleaning up purposes so

00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,260
this adopt the app went to the city of

00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:52,150
Chicago where they do adopt sidewalks

00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,470
same thing ice and snow events they

00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:56,290
clean them citizens volunteer to clean

00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:58,630
them off I went to Seattle where they do

00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:00,880
adopt a storm drain apparently I rains a

00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,260
lot in Seattle litter trash tree

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,910
branches get stuff in the drains and

00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:06,640
citizens clean them off it went to

00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,650
Honolulu where they have adopted tsunami

00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,060
siren where citizens help out on a

00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:12,160
monthly basis to make sure that the

00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,050
tsunami sirens are audible and working

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,610
and that they have batteries because

00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,140
apparently people still batteries out of

00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:22,000
these things in Hawaii cuz they're

00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:23,800
valuable so we did adopt a bus shelter I

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,990
saw an opportunity where the City of

00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,730
Raleigh basically put out a pen and

00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:30,850
paper program for adopting bus shelters

00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:32,920
same thing citizens can basically call

00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:35,260
the city and say hey I want to adopt bus

00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,160
shelter 122 they basically just clean it

00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,480
up once a month makes

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,290
it's tidy make sure it looks good for

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,560
the users of the bus shelter so our our

00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:45,759
brigade got together with Public Works

00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,410
we pitch the idea said hey we want to

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,389
put a technical front end on this on

00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:52,360
this program that you just launched and

00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:54,279
we did basically took us about two weeks

00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,079
to get the code up and running and to

00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:59,829
get all the get some clean sanitized

00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:01,540
data into the into the program we spent

00:15:59,829 --> 00:16:03,160
the rest of our time marketing the

00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,420
effort because nobody in the world knows

00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,000
that you could adopt a bus shelter in

00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,139
the City of Raleigh one success point

00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,540
for us was we actually doubled the

00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:15,129
number of adoptions during our campaign

00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:17,170
but it's not all sunshine and roses here

00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:19,300
we we actually hit some road bumps along

00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:21,639
the way so after the campaign we had

00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,079
some issues we had to figure out some

00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:24,490
challenges we had to figure out who's

00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:25,449
going to update this code after we're

00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,949
done because we're just a group of

00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:29,079
volunteers that was getting this

00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:30,579
application stood up we had some of

00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:31,569
those handoff issues of what happens

00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:33,220
when there's a new bus shelter who's

00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:35,139
going to actually physically enter that

00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,519
into the system so we're working at

00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:37,899
those details now but I mentioned that

00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:40,269
in case any of you get involved with

00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:41,319
this to start thinking kind of on the

00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:42,550
enterprise level and some of these

00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:44,980
things you're going to have to do if

00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:47,980
you're volunteering with technology like

00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:50,589
this so we're really friendly in Raleigh

00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,930
we helped form two other brigades in our

00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:55,449
area one in the town of cary and one in

00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:58,750
the city of durham we meet on a monthly

00:16:55,449 --> 00:17:00,130
basis and the captain's basically we do

00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,860
a google hangout and we share what's

00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:04,569
happening in our brigades we also share

00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:07,150
a joint meetup page so that anyone in

00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:09,130
the triangle can figure out what's

00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:10,750
happening with with our division we call

00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:14,199
it a division if you're having a

00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:16,510
military background and and we're

00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:18,039
basically working collaboratively as a

00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,270
region to make sure we're not

00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:21,339
duplicating efforts or that we're

00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:24,459
enhancing existing efforts for each

00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:26,949
brigade there so if you're interested

00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:28,929
stuff there are brigades all over the US

00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:31,059
in fact there are new brigades forming

00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:34,299
all over the world there's a code for

00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:36,280
Poland there's a code for Japan if

00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:38,289
you're inspired by this see if there's a

00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,990
brigade in your area and see how you can

00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:42,549
join and see how you can help and if

00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,140
you're really inspired and there's not

00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:45,909
one in the area maybe you want to be

00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,700
that catalyst and get that community

00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:49,370
going so that's a little bit about

00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,559
what's happening

00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:52,790
on the citizen side that's kind of all

00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:55,430
volunteer work that we're doing as a

00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:56,570
brigade as City camp organizers want to

00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,890
walk you through a few things that the

00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,830
City of Raleigh has been working on as

00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:04,309
well one of the first apps they deployed

00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:05,390
is called see click fix it's basically a

00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:08,000
bug tracking tool for city

00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:10,240
infrastructure it uses the open 311

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,309
protocol that allows citizens to report

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:16,640
non-emergency issues to the city think

00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:18,140
things like potholes graffiti broken

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,540
park bench something that's not kind of

00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:23,090
key to the infrastructure I love the

00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:24,740
transparency aspect of it I love the

00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:26,960
fact that you don't have to memorize a

00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,880
phone number figure out which department

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,020
you need to call you basically submit

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,150
something through the web or through

00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,440
your mobile device the city takes it and

00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,530
they triage it on the back end they

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,780
figure out which department it goes to

00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:41,000
they acknowledge that you're that your

00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:43,040
issues been accepted and they keep it

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,990
updated as you go you can also vote up

00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,720
separate things and one of my favorite

00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:49,220
features is you can actually set set up

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,720
a block area so that if you just care

00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,250
about your little part of the city you

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,420
can get alerts for when something's

00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:58,250
happening in that section in February

00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:00,170
2012 they pass an open government

00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,480
resolution this accomplished two things

00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:04,010
it basically said that basically put

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,740
open-source software on an equal playing

00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:09,080
field with proprietary software it

00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,820
didn't mandate it and that's okay but it

00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,130
said that we prefer to use open source

00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:15,200
software the second thing that it did is

00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:19,250
that it basically created a mandate for

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,720
an open data portal the best part about

00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,640
this it wasn't just a kind of a pen and

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,440
paper resolution rara we're going to be

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,390
open government it actually provided a

00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,790
roadmap on step so the city was going to

00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:32,179
take in order to accomplish these these

00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:34,640
IDs ideas so they launched open Raleigh

00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:36,920
it's basically a web page / portal where

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,480
it's highlighting all the different open

00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:42,410
source and open data things happening in

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,380
the city they launched an application

00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:47,210
called my Raleigh ideas it's a solution

00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,140
from a company called Granicus that

00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:50,929
allows citizens to participate

00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,460
collaboratively online they can give

00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:54,770
feedback on things like the budget

00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,290
process or the actual budget how that's

00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:58,880
being allocated Street corridor studies

00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:01,760
and as you can see on the screen shot

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,110
here the open data project the city of

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,730
Rio is very strategic when they

00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,080
did their open data initiative they

00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,179
didn't just say let's open source all

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,530
the data they asked developers they

00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:11,990
asked citizens they asked businesses

00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:13,549
what data do you care about so the first

00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:15,830
version of our open data portal looks

00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:19,100
something like this people really care

00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:20,630
about transit data crime data and they

00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:24,080
found that our er we're really concerned

00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:25,940
with permit data and in trail areas so

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,760
these are kind of some of the things

00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,020
that they worked on initially the best

00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,640
part about this is that the

00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,960
visualization component of it I don't

00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,240
know about you but I cannot stand

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,160
reading 60 pages of PDFs of tabulated

00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,630
data I'd much rather have a pretty map

00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,360
with colors on it that I can actually

00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:44,600
show to someone so last month they

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,710
launched the the full that was the

00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,090
previous one was the beta version this

00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:50,450
is actually the full version that they

00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:51,980
have now it's based on a solution from a

00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,650
company called secreta out of Seattle

00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:57,110
Washington not fully open source but

00:20:54,650 --> 00:21:00,230
open core so close enough for the needs

00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:01,730
of this they also have open api's the

00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,500
advantage of this is the pretty turnkey

00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,880
solution right they can come in to any

00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,559
city government or any government for

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,059
that matter and put up the stand up the

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,429
platform and start entering data and

00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:12,260
voila you've got an open data platform

00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:14,210
if you're interested in the open source

00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:17,030
alternative to this there's a project

00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:18,770
called see can see kan that probably

00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:22,910
takes a little bit more ramp up time but

00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:24,020
does provide a full open source stack so

00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,570
I didn't get to talk about all these

00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:28,640
initiatives today but the point I want

00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:30,799
to make here is that what seemed like

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,480
what started with City camp it's all

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,950
attributing to this concept of an

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,220
open-source City and helping us define

00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:39,890
what an open-source city could be as

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:41,090
with any movement storytelling is a very

00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:43,090
important part of it whether it's open

00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:46,669
source open government or open data and

00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:48,230
so I decided to share this story so I'm

00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:50,480
sharing the story with you today but I

00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:51,710
also wrote it down for everyone and I

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,960
wrote a book called the foundation for

00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:56,540
an open-source city it basically is

00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,240
designed for anyone who doesn't know

00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:01,429
anything about open source it defines

00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,620
open source defines open data defines

00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:05,570
open government in plain English it's

00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,400
designed for elected officials who need

00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:09,320
to know what open source is so that they

00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,450
can make decisions and help the IT

00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,630
department advanced government through

00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:17,529
open source and so in the book I outline

00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:19,609
five elements of an open source city

00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:21,859
the first one is about culture and

00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:23,599
participation luckily in raleigh in the

00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:25,549
Triangle area we have a lot of active

00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:26,989
citizens who are who want to be involved

00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:29,059
in who want to find out ways that they

00:22:26,989 --> 00:22:30,529
can influence and change government not

00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:32,629
from a lobbying perspective but more

00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:35,419
from from a factor they just want to

00:22:32,629 --> 00:22:37,519
participate then I get into some of the

00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:38,989
policies and I separate out the

00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:40,429
government and the data policies because

00:22:38,989 --> 00:22:43,119
they don't have to come together they

00:22:40,429 --> 00:22:45,919
don't have to come one after the other

00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:47,389
if there's an institution out there

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,769
that's really not interested in doing

00:22:47,389 --> 00:22:50,299
the open source procurement piece of it

00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:52,129
yet maybe they want to start with open

00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:53,899
data and maybe seeing the benefits of

00:22:52,129 --> 00:22:55,700
having open data and the philosophy of

00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:58,429
that can help them get to an open

00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,869
government policy and then they're

00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:02,090
supporting user groups and conferences

00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:04,279
I'm sure that many of you go to meetups

00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:06,229
several nights a week several nights a

00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:07,849
month having businesses and

00:23:06,229 --> 00:23:09,769
organizations support those meetups is

00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:12,289
really important we need places to meet

00:23:09,769 --> 00:23:14,570
we need tables chairs Wi-Fi be great if

00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:16,399
we had some free food for our meetups

00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:18,460
and supporting that and in larger

00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:21,109
conferences is really important to

00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:22,309
having an open source city and then if

00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:24,080
you want to get the attention of any

00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:26,779
elected official you can ring the

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,729
economic development bell hey elected

00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:30,649
official all this open source and open

00:23:28,729 --> 00:23:33,379
data stuff can actually create jobs and

00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:36,529
there's a lot of obviously a lot of us

00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:38,299
have jobs because of this but from open

00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:39,950
source but it's great that you can

00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:41,599
actually prove that there are ecosystems

00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:45,470
that will develop around open government

00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:48,440
and Open Data initiatives so what I want

00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:49,759
to leave you with today is that we all

00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,889
have an opportunity to influence our

00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:54,139
government this concept of being a

00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:56,619
citizen CIO we Nate we may not be able

00:23:54,139 --> 00:23:58,940
to dictate what software our cities use

00:23:56,619 --> 00:24:01,489
but we can sure as hell influence what

00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:03,769
they use and we can keep being that

00:24:01,489 --> 00:24:06,499
squeaky wheel to say why aren't we using

00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:08,419
open source yet why aren't we using open

00:24:06,499 --> 00:24:12,309
data yet and there's an opportunity for

00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:14,539
us to to change the game and then lastly

00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:15,679
basically the the mission is for you

00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:17,330
know you guys are changing the world are

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,379
ready with the patchy but you have an

00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,940
opportunity to change the world in a

00:24:18,379 --> 00:24:21,229
different way if you're not into the

00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,179
civic hacking thing look for other

00:24:21,229 --> 00:24:24,559
opportunities there's a lot of

00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:26,599
opportunity in the open health space

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,789
there's a lot of opportunity education

00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:30,830
we can take what we know from open

00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:32,510
source and the open source philosophy

00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:36,710
and apply it to other areas that affect

00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:38,240
our lives on a day-to-day basis so I'll

00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:40,610
end with that and basically just

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,260
challenged you to help me open source

00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:44,260
