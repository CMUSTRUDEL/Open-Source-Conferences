so good morning everyone uh i'm hillary

00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,880
if you do want to ask any questions i

00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,400
don't think we'll be taking questions

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,440
but you can send them to me on twitter

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,200
at h mason

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,639
or if you're too shy to do it even in

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,640
that form of public i'm

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,840
me at hillarymason.com pretty easy to

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,920
find

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,600
so my topic for this morning is the past

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,680
present and future of data engineering

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,560
which sounds like a very comprehensive

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,800
topic

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,920
but don't fear i'm only going to take

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,519
little stories

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,439
that hopefully tie an interesting

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,440
narrative together

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,480
it's early and i hope you have all had

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,840
your coffee

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,680
i mean this gentleman just said you're

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,399
going to budapest and nobody even

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,559
screamed

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,800
right so uh i see the purpose of a good

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,800
opening keynote as to give someone

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,399
everyone here something to talk about as

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,920
they go through the day

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,920
so if you agree with me if you don't

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,440
agree with me it's great

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,680
just talk about it and make sure

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,079
that uh that you let me know as well

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,280
so let's just set the stage for where

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,560
data computing

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,720
is today and i'm going to do that by

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,840
referring to reddit how many people here

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,760
are familiar with reddit come on

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,600
all right almost everyone all right when

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,000
i explain reddit to people i usually say

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,799
it's the armpit of the social web

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,799
and i mean that as a compliment in that

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,640
reddit is the sort of environment where

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,640
you know it's not that beautiful

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,320
it has the kind of freedom that we don't

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,759
see in a lot of places

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,600
which means that some really horrible

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,960
stuff ends up on reddit and i don't i

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,479
don't think anyone would argue with that

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,400
but also some really wonderful and

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,280
creative things sort of emerge from that

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,799
freedom

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,280
and this is one thing that i thought was

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,159
amazing so somebody asked this question

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,079
if someone from the 1950s appeared today

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,119
what would be the hardest thing for us

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,759
to explain to them

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,720
about how we live and here is the best

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,119
answer

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,280
i possess a device in my pocket that is

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,880
capable of accessing the entirety of

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,799
information known to man

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,079
i use it to look at pictures of cats and

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,680
get in arguments with strangers

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,920
what this tells me is that our

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,560
technology has progressed rapidly

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,640
and yet humankind has not we we are

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,200
really consistent beings

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,840
and technology is amazing uh and yet

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,480
there's still

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,640
a long way to go um but this is a talk

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,040
primarily about the practice of data

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,879
engineering but i don't think it's

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,959
possible to talk about engineering or

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,800
data engineering without talking about

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,160
people and what people do

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,720
with that data and so let's begin in the

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,000
past

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,000
the distant past this in fact is 1880

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,040
the u.s in 1880 it doesn't look that

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,640
dissimilar

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,959
than the u.s today in 1880 the census

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,200
took

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,120
seven years to compile and yet the

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,200
population the united states doubled

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,200
between 1880 and 1890

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,280
which meant they had a problem right the

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,280
constitution requires the census to be

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,879
completed every 10 years

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,760
this was a big data problem

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,840
but there were reasons that at that time

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,640
technology allowed them to find

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,840
a solution and so this guy who if you

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,400
remove his mustache

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,400
would totally fit in in this room today

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,519
his name's herman hollerith and he's

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,640
from new york

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,000
uh like me so go new york he came up

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,200
with an idea

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,360
and his idea he patented it's a machine

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,280
for counting people and if you actually

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,159
do read this patent it explicitly

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,120
describes a machine for one purpose only

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,599
that is counting people and this machine

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,680
was inspired by the way the conductors

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,159
on trains would mark tickets with punch

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,720
holes

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,400
to indicate who had paid their fare so

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,319
he saw this and he thought oh we can do

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,920
that around the whole country

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,159
to count people and this is what it

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,280
looked like so there's a box of cards on

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,519
the right side

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,319
a lot of little dials the actual card

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,360
punchers

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,280
up on the table there and he started a

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,319
company called the tabulating machine

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,239
company

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,080
now vint cerf has a wonderful quote that

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,000
i'm going to mingle slightly but he said

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,680
something along the lines of if computer

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,439
scientists had named kentucky fried

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,560
chicken we would have called it hot dead

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,760
bird

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,439
so through many mergers and

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,280
and other business relationships

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,040
tabulating machine company eventually

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,560
became a company called international

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,400
business machines which we are all

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,120
familiar with and in fact i'm sure some

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,919
people

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,600
who work there are probably here today

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,600
and here's here's a woman actually out

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,199
in the field using his machine to punch

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,720
the cards this is what the cards

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,639
initially looked like

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,639
and they had this decoder key where you

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,320
can actually like sort of figure out

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,160
it's actually quite complicated um

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,680
and in fact i did figure out that if

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,440
you're using 8bit ascii you couldn't

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,880
even fit one tweet on the card but if

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,560
you see the comment on the bottom here

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,680
someone figured out if you use 6-bit

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,600
ascii you can

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,160
fit a tweet on the card but you're

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,680
limited to only alphanumeric characters

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,040
so it gives you a sense of the amount of

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,040
data we could store in this format

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,720
but the punch cards were exactly the

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,880
size of 1887 u.s currency

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,039
which looked like this which is super

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,600
badass i don't know why we don't still

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:08,000
have bills that look like this

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,080
but the cards were that size because he

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,120
managed to get a bunch of second-hand

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,120
treasury boxes to store the cards in

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,039
so as an engineer this tells me there is

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,919
always a reason why things are the way

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,240
they are

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,919
if you only know the right person to ask

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,240
and i was thinking about that when i ran

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,280
into this question on super user

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,680
where somebody very sincerely asked why

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,520
does windows start with the letter c

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,199
now everybody with a bit of gray hair is

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,199
laughing and so those of you who don't

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,199
get it can ask them later

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,919
but there's always a reason why things

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,080
are the way they are

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,840
so back to this problem they figured it

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,400
out

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,520
onward i'm going to zoom forward it's

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,280
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,400
we have this machine this is the

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,479
hollerith type 1 tabulation machine

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,840
this is the first reprogrammable

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,160
counting machine

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,479
and if you look at the jumpers they were

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,960
fashioned after the layout of the punch

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,720
card

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,000
again there's always a reason why things

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,360
are the way they are

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,280
this was the first machine that you

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,080
could reprogram to count different

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,120
things

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:14,160
so that's pretty cool

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,360
they nailed it let's uh let's go forward

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,240
again

00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,680
1928 ibm standardizes on the punch card

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,680
we know and love today which has

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,080
rectangular punches

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,680
um it was used for a bunch of businesses

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,199
at this time so this is a woman who

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,639
started her own consulting business

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,919
where she would come into your business

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,919
and count all the things you had to

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,240
count and then she'd leave again

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,680
you can actually buy punch cards on ebay

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,560
they're really cheap if you are

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,560
so inclined

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,280
still possible so 1930s again

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,319
40 years forward the word super

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,400
is used in new york to describe a

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,440
tabulation machine made for columbia

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,880
university

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,639
and when i first saw this i was like

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,479
great they're using it for some amazing

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,000
research but of course no

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,680
they were using it to do accounting

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,120
and this is the machine that came out in

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,639
the 30s the ibm

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,560
401 it looked pretty sweet again to set

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,360
some context this is times square in new

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,400
york city

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,639
in the 1930s that's what it looked like

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,919
this is how you got to denver in the 30s

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,840
for those of you who would have come

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,599
from chicago you would have taken this

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,479
train which actually looks pretty cool

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,479
and futuristic

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,319
it might be better than what we have

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,560
today so at this point in the 30s

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,680
we have reprogrammable machines that can

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,919
count multiply

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,800
and divide and they're starting to take

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,960
over

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:42,560
right so 1959 again to set some context

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,560
this was a real advertisement

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,280
ibm comes out with the 1401 which was a

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,800
suite of computing machinery

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,720
is there anyone in the room who used one

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,360
of these i think maybe

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,960
we have a few yes um i'd love to hear

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,800
some stories later

00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:01,120
but a suite of machinery that was uh

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,720
they received more orders for this in

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,479
the first six weeks after it was

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,639
announced than they expected to in the

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,960
lifetime of the product there was a huge

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,520
demand for this sort of data engineering

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,759
and computing machinery at this time

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,960
and it cost twenty five hundred dollars

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,919
a month

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,680
it's a lot of money uh just to count

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,240
things but people were finding ways to

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,440
use it

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,919
um payroll freight

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,360
uh anywhere you had to keep track of

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,199
stuff

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,599
right again anywhere where you have to

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,640
count

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:37,039
things you might sense a theme here so

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,279
you program these machines in fargo

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,240
again a language that was defined

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,000
inspired by

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,159
in many ways the layout of those punch

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,920
cards and rpg which in its initial

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,399
versions was similar but i believe has

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,839
changed a lot over the years

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,760
and if you want to go down that rabbit

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,200
hole i recommend you set several hours

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,160
aside for it

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,320
so the ibm 1401 was famously marketed as

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,240
being easy to use but if you actually go

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,600
and read people's experiences

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,279
with this machine they would go through

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,240
six weeks of training and come out the

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,519
other side

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,959
saying like i still don't know what's

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,200
going on so in 2006 this composer

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,040
was inspired by the manual for this

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,200
machine which was quite substantial to

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,760
create an interpretive dance

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:22,240
and i've selected a small clip of it for

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:24,160
you here today

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,560
and if dance and art does anything it

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,399
captures the emotional experience

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,399
um of the 1401.

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,640
and the music is also beautiful and

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:40,320
highly recommended all right

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,880
so big data in the 50s let's talk about

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,560
2013. that was not so long ago we all

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,320
remember it so let's say you want to

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,399
count a lot of things you might use

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,160
something like hadoop

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,440
and you might end up in an environment

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,160
like this where you say

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,959
tell me what to do it's still not that

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,000
easy guys

00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,160
okay um they fixed it though

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,519
to all credit to uh to the cloudera

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,640
distribution it is repaired in 2014.

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,440
um so i love this photo for talking

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,839
about data

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,000
engineering um because every single

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,680
person in this photo has a device in

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,360
their hand and if you look at it closely

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,959
you start to see even more things like

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,440
someone in the front has a laptop

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,440
open in their arms and people are

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,720
holding a mix of phones and cameras and

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,480
devices

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,240
and this is president obama like

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,560
campaigning and there's the official

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,200
documentation but there's also all of

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,240
this data being collected by people

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,839
having this shared experience here and

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,399
so this is an amazing

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,200
way to understand that we are collecting

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,279
more data

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,120
than we ever have before and yet

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,959
we still basically only know how to

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,040
count it

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,200
so let's do some definitions in that you

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,480
can't talk about data in the present

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,200
without dealing with a few buzz words

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,040
and i just want to hit them head on i've

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,959
converged on a definition of data

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,959
engineering

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,360
that i like maybe you don't like it but

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,880
i'd love to hear feedback that is

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,640
when you're building a system where the

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,800
design and the architecture of the

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,640
system itself depends on the nature of

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,480
the data flowing through it

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,920
and that's how data engineering is

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,320
slightly distinct from

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,399
uh more traditional systems engineering

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,519
now big data we have to face this one

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,680
head on uh i really hate this term

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,120
so i'm sort of subverting the definition

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,360
of this term as well so

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,640
some people think big data is too big

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,920
for excel

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,360
and again if we have anyone from

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,560
microsoft in the room i know you're

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,800
working on it

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,920
but um i still hear from people quite

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,399
often that like oh

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,240
you know it's too big for excel so it

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,519
must be big data so i need a hadoop or

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,720
something like that

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,480
um what some people mean here

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,880
actually is that it's too big for them

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,320
to look at and for them to see patterns

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,320
in that data

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,800
so engineers like to use a different

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,959
definition of big data so we say okay

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,440
big data is big if i can't just analyze

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,880
it in memory on my one computer

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,399
and that's getting better but the

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,920
problem is that the computer you have

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,600
today is really quite different than the

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,040
computer you had two years ago which is

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,480
quite different than the computer you'll

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,639
have two years from now

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,920
which is also really different from like

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,920
if you're doing any computing on a

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,920
raspberry pi or a beaglebone black

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,920
you know so one computer doesn't mean

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,200
one thing so we need to pin that down a

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,040
bit

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,800
and then what do you get so what's the

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,560
difference between being able to do it

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,399
in memory on one computer versus two

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,519
computers versus a hundred versus a

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,760
thousand

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,680
um so what you really get from that is

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,720
that big data is data made

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,519
useful in the sense that as a data

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,560
scientist

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,279
or engineer you can ask a question of

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,519
that data

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,120
and get an answer back before you forget

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,920
why you asked that question in the first

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,320
place

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,959
so there's my definition of big data for

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,360
you

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:56,560
it is data made useful to us as human

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,720
beings trying to solve real problems

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,399
another thing that comes up a lot is

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,480
that uh

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,600
some people think your data has to be

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,760
really big to be

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,720
interesting and this is absolutely not

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,639
true

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,760
a lot of really interesting work is done

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,120
on relatively

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,800
small data um which still fits under the

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,959
the umbrella of usefulness so if you

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,079
have a data set that's gigabytes in size

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,480
describing

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,079
some sort of interesting human behavior

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,680
like say dating

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,600
you're going to do something way more

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,720
interesting with that data than somebody

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,200
who has petabytes of something less

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,920
compelling

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,839
all right so data scientists um that is

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,920
my job title actually for the first time

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,000
in my life but i do want to clarify why

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,440
i think the term data scientist is worth

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,839
hanging on to you

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,639
um i know it's a bit controversial as

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,720
well

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,480
data scientists don't do anything that

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,959
people haven't done for a really long

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,480
time

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,240
so people have done math and statistics

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,320
for a very long time

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,440
they have written code for a very long

00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,360
time

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,880
and they have asked good questions for a

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,800
very long time but

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,959
they have never done it before in one

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,880
professional position

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,000
and that's something that's possible now

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,240
because it is much

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,199
easier to apply all of these things

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,360
together

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,839
so that you don't need to to dedicate

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,480
your expertise to merely one facet of it

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,720
rather

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,920
it's possible to understand how to do

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,839
all three things

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,079
and when i say ask the right questions

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,639
that is really the hardest skill

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,480
of a data scientist that is there's no

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:32,240
greater insult than you have an elegant

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,240
solution to an irrelevant problem

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,199
and there are lots of reasons this is

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,639
happening now

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,480
i think many of those reasons are

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,160
sitting here in this room but we have

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,079
we have the tools to do this we have the

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,959
cpu power to do it it's affordable

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,800
we have the data and we sort of know how

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,079
to write algorithms to do interesting

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,000
things

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,560
so let's talk about what the real life

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,320
of a data data engineer is like

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,079
briefly i was guessing everyone here

00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,440
would be around my age so i could use my

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,160
favorite movie references

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,519
and i think it worked the data

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,160
engineering process

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,279
today in many companies looks something

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,720
like this so you say

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,320
okay i have some data i have a question

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,680
i'm going to use my hadoop cluster and

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,880
run a job that's going to take some

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,120
hours or i'm going to

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,320
you know play with it in ipython or in r

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,160
and figure out

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,639
the right approach to solving the

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,920
problem i'm trying to solve

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,000
and then if it's the kind of thing we

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,199
want to build a product around i'm going

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,880
to go redesign new infrastructure that

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,399
takes advantage of all the shortcuts i

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,000
learned in that previous research

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,600
process

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,279
and then i'm going to you know try and

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,079
deploy that and see where it fails and

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,639
then i'm going to keep

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,160
iterating until till it works and that's

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,920
how you take something that looks like

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,040
this and you know end up with something

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,720
that looks like that

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,800
you end up writing a lot of code like

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,959
this that gets thrown away

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,639
just to count things given the overhead

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,959
of using the infrastructure

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,120
so in many cases data engineering today

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,800
resembles this process

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,639
where you have an idea you have some

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,480
data you have an approach and you just

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,160
keep doing it over and over again until

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,399
you get something

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,800
useful and so you might ask the question

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,360
like are we today in a utopia or a

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,279
dystopia

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,079
and i'm definitely going to err on the

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,680
side of optimism and i'll tell you why

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,279
here are some things people are doing

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,800
with data today that i find

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,040
amazing and i'm not going to give you

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,720
examples from finance

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,600
or from advertising because i think

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,759
those are a little bit too obvious

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,600
this is an app called dark sky i have no

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,600
connection to this app whatsoever but

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,839
this is a group of people who take

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,360
public us government weather data your

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,680
gps location

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,360
do a micro forecast and send up an alert

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,560
on your phone when it's about to rain

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,000
right where you are it's really cool

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,240
and if you don't have an iphone which i

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,759
don't they have a website called

00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,360
forecast.io and they also have an api so

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:55,440
you can build this sort of weather micro

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,440
forecasting into your own applications

00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,600
this is a woman named lauren talbot who

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,120
gave a talk at data gotham where she

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,800
talked about how

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,439
the mayor's office of analytics under

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,480
mayor bloomberg in new york city

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,959
decided to use data in the city

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,160
to improve the problems that the city is

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,799
charged with

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,799
with improving the problem she and her

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,280
team looked at was ambulance response

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,240
time

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,360
so they took data from they tried to

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,959
understand the process

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,679
the call goes into the call center the

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,199
operator on 9-1-1 talks to the person

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,760
at some point they hand off to another

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,679
agency the agency will eventually direct

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,280
the call to the ambulance the ambulance

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,880
will go to the scene

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,120
so they looked at every stage in this

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,520
process her talk is actually

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,120
amazing because the statistics here are

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,640
fairly straightforward

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,320
what's really interesting is that they

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,000
were able to actually measure

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,760
the order in which the operators should

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,720
be asking their questions when you call

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,039
9-1-1

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,360
like what's the most optimal way to get

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,720
to the answer as quickly as possible

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,799
and they also looked at where the

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,039
ambulances should wait in new york city

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,240
for the calls to come in

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,400
and of course they found out the

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,480
ambulances don't sit anywhere near the

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,320
optimal point for them to sit given the

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,760
prediction of call volume

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,520
instead of telling them what to do they

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,120
actually asked the ambulance drivers

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,120
like why do you sit where you sit

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,840
and they said because there's a 24-hour

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,320
bathroom and coffee shop here

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,400
so they found them 24-hour services

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,280
closer to the optimal points and over

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,440
all of these

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,360
fairly minor interventions they reduced

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,720
the ambulance response times by a minute

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,760
in new york city

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,919
so a big data success

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,679
this one is the jawbone up i don't know

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,160
how many people have some form of

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:39,679
accelerometer on their person today

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,600
anyone a few people sheepishly are

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,280
saying yes

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,120
so this thing measures your steps and

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,240
your sleep and it's a fairly simple

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,799
device

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,679
but monica rogadi their vp of data put

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,799
this together

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,960
where during daylight savings time the

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,400
average user of the jawbone lost 11

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,039
minutes of sleep

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,880
because of daylight savings time if you

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,679
project that out to the u.s population

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,440
that is 6

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,520
000 years of lost sleep because of our

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,440
daylight savings time policies

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,280
so uh maybe you can actually learn

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,039
something from these little devices that

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,760
we're each gathering data for own

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,720
personal

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,919
uh edification that can direct policy

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,520
that can actually help us

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,600
as a society make better decisions

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,360
all right so two more examples uh this

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,080
one i love it's from communications of

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,000
the acm

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,360
describing a research project where

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,360
linguists use machine learning

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,480
algorithms to take our modern spoken

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,799
languages

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,760
the rate of mutation in our modern

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,320
languages

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,320
and to reverse engineer the ancestral

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,440
language from which our modern languages

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,360
descended

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,360
what's notable about this is that it is

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,360
a problem that could not be done without

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,880
the deep domain expertise of the

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,720
linguists

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,200
but also could not be done without the

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,080
computation ability of modern

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,840
technology and in fact one of the

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,240
linguists in the article is quoted

00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,039
saying computation is the new handmade

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,880
of science

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,799
meaning instead of mathematics we've

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,840
gone pretty far in mathematics

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,760
now we have computation as well all

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,840
right the last example

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,520
is uh you can actually read about this

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,679
in wired um

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,000
it turns out if you include bacon in a

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,640
recipe it boosts the ratings that recipe

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,799
gets

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,400
so if if you're looking to uh to game

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,720
the system

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,679
you can also use ingredients like cream

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,559
cheese

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,000
and strawberries and avocado to uh you

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,960
know sort of uh

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,159
boost the attention for your recipes

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,520
something we might not know

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,440
without a lot of data so no no talk

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,120
about data is complete without a graph

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,799
that goes up into the right i like this

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,000
one because it goes down into the right

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,679
too

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,360
but it does make the point that we are

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,720
still at the beginning of collecting and

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,679
figuring out what we can do with all

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,960
that stuff

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:55,120
so it is easy to be very optimistic

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:57,200
right so to the future

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,679
our capabilities are growing but they're

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,360
growing in a bunch of different ways so

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,159
at excel we've seen a whole layer of

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,240
infrastructure companies that is

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,799
giving us the tools to store data and

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,880
retrieve data efficiently

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,799
we've started to see tools on top of

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,000
that that make it easier to do

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:19,120
fairly complex analyses not

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,559
so much to say that if you were not

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,640
capable of doing it before you're

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,000
capable of doing it now but rather if it

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,840
would have taken you two weeks to

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,880
program it before now it might take you

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,840
a few days

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,440
we still have a long way to go in making

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,080
building these sorts of systems

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,400
accessible cheap and easy to do

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,000
accurately

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,000
so there's always a caution there

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,200
this is one where i hope it's very

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,520
provocative i hope data systems use

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,600
natural language i've seen a few things

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,440
on the natural language input so english

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,120
to sql type translation

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,120
i've also seen things like narrative

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,320
sciences released a product that takes

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,480
your google analytics

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,039
report and emails it to you in plain

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,679
english natural language generation it's

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,240
totally

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,000
fascinating and i hope that the people

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,400
who are building the infrastructure will

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,640
think

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,159
about this sort of user experience as

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,320
well

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,679
and maybe someday we'll get there it's a

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,760
great movie

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,840
all right another thing i think about a

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,080
lot is uh hardware

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,520
it is really easy to build things with

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,840
hardware today

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,600
um and yet the data scientists don't

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,159
really talk to the hardware hackers all

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,440
that much

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:32,080
but that's going to change because

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,840
the cost of hardware is getting so much

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,679
lower in the same way that the cost of

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,919
data infrastructure became so much

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,360
cheaper in the last few years

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,360
and the two things just go together

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,520
naturally so we are bringing

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,600
our capability of collecting data from

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,640
the online world from social media

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:51,840
into the real world uh where we can

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:55,440
can hopefully do good things with that

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,919
um anyone get that one no it's jurassic

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,360
park

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,200
fun um and the last point i wanted to

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,799
make is one that um

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,400
that i think everyone who's actually

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,720
here at apache con

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,080
already knows which is that none of this

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,880
happens without a strong

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,400
community that actually comes together

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,039
thinks about what the future

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,200
should look like and supports each other

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,679
in achieving that future

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,480
and it's been really rewarding to be at

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,600
least a small

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,520
part of our data community

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,120
and to see things like this event happen

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,720
and go forward and to see how people are

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,840
reaching out and bringing new people

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:35,440
into the community this is necessary

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,280
for uh for that future growth

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,960
right oh and if you are in new york we

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,400
have a small event there called data

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,080
gotham which is a lot of fun

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,320
and yes that is both a jay-z and a

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,760
batman reference

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:50,720
right so again i'll just conclude by

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,559
saying that uh

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,440
hopefully this has been an interesting

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:58,000
tour of a bunch of little rabbit holes

00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,080
i find the pace of change in the way

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,400
people think about managing data to be

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,159
completely fascinating

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,039
it is astounding in many ways that in

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,400
2014 we are still really just able to

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,880
count things

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,640
uh we are only starting to be able to do

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,360
more interesting things than that

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,960
and yet uh the future is pretty bright i

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,880
do like to say that data gives us

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,640
superpowers but i mean that in a very

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,720
literal sense that it gives us the

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,200
ability to perceive things and take

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
action

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,720
in the world about things that we

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,200
otherwise as raw human beings could

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,760
never

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,440
perceive so data is making us smarter

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,640
and data infrastructure is making it

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,520
possible

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,960
so let's make more of that so thank you

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:44,000
very much and i hope to talk to you

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:44,000
