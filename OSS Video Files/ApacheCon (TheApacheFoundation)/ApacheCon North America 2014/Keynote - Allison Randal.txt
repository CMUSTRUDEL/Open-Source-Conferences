	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,770
so the past few years I've taken to

00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:07,250
studying physics really just for fun

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,170
mostly astrophysics in quantum physics

00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:13,200
and there is one thing that I deeply

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:16,170
admire about physicists and that is

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,270
they're not at all ashamed to admit when

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,820
they've made a mistake not only are they

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,380
not ashamed they're almost gleeful about

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,400
declaring that they've made a mistake

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:29,460
and everyone before them was wrong so as

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,590
an example in the beginning of any

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,680
decent astrophysics textbook it'll have

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,579
a prologue that begins once upon a time

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:42,780
we believed that the earth was flat and

00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:45,210
boy were we wrong or once upon a time we

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:50,820
believed that the Sun rotated around the

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:52,949
earth and boy were we wrong if you read

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,930
a quantum physics textbook pretty much

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,910
the entire book is dedicated to

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:01,559
demonstrating how classical physics is

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:03,840
wrong from beginning to end so I think

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,670
it's kind of a shame that computer

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,600
science textbooks don't start the same

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,900
way once upon a time we believe that all

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,080
software would be statically compiled

00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:19,979
boy were we wrong once upon a time we

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:24,869
believed that 64k of ram was a lot of

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:27,360
memory who were we wrong once upon a

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,820
time we believed that all execution

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,200
would be single threaded in a single

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:42,119
process on a single machine and boy were

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:44,490
we wrong so so so very wrong so I'm a

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,409
bit of a unix graybeard I may not look

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,590
it but I promise you deep inside I am

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,810
and I have to confess I have a little

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,460
bit of a knee-jerk reaction when I see

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,899
words like cloud or web two point oh so

00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:00,390
I'm going to take a step back sort of

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,700
use the Wayback Machine and let's sort

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,570
of debunk some myths and see what we're

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,880
really dealing with here so the essence

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:12,930
of cloud technology is

00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:15,660
networked computing all right this goes

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,270
back to the 1950s the first set of

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,460
networked computers was sage the

00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,710
semi-automatic ground network it was a

00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:26,100
military installation for aggregating

00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:29,190
radar data in order to observe a large

00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:33,900
swath of the sky at once and detect

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:36,120
threats go on a little further we have a

00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,130
few incremental refinements we get

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:43,050
ARPANET the first packet switching

00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:44,640
network and also in that same decades

00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,890
decade we have the beginning of

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,360
virtualization so virtualization being

00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,970
the idea that you can have a single

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,950
physical machine that pretends that it's

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,170
multiple different machines on top

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,690
called virtual machines so it presents

00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:04,050
the the appearance of being more than

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:07,110
one physical machine tcp/ip 1970s this

00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,610
was a standardized protocol for

00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,460
formatting transmitting and receiving

00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:13,980
data packets again just another very

00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,630
very very simple refinement over what

00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:19,980
was there before but in an important

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:22,740
refinement and in the 80s roundabout we

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:28,010
started calling it the internet so this

00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:32,160
was one big network built on tcp/ip in

00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:34,860
the 90s we called it the web so it's

00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,960
still the same internet does not really

00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,170
much change the big difference for the

00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,209
web the world wide web was just that

00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,740
there was now content that more than

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:45,720
just a small group of technical users

00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:49,200
cared about that's the big difference so

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:52,470
the internet by itself tcp/ip ARPANET

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,330
sage this is all just plumbing when you

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,700
start adding content that individual

00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:01,380
usuals users actually care about then it

00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:04,410
becomes a big deal then it takes off in

00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:07,230
the 2000s for no apparent reason we had

00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:11,010
to change the name again and call it web

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:13,260
20 it's still HTML it's still CSS it's

00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:16,290
still JavaScript there is a slight

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,340
difference in the sense that people had

00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,530
us a like in in the

00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,720
in the 90s it was sort of like mostly

00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,760
static content in the 2000s there was a

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,500
sense that things were dynamic that you

00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,990
should be able to go to a page and do

00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,910
more than just click a text link and see

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,430
another page it should have dynamic

00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:39,250
behavior so man maybe it's kind of worth

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:42,699
a new name in this decade we call it the

00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,199
cloud so again this is the same

00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,970
technology right you've got your web

00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:48,699
servers you got your HTML you got your

00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:51,870
CSS you got your JavaScript but there is

00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:56,680
a slight difference and that is a

00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:59,800
deployment abstraction so you know in in

00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:03,600
the 2000s virtualization started to

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:06,880
become big for deploying web services

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,430
Zen and kvm and you know those sorts of

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,150
projects but the level of abstraction

00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:17,229
was kind of it really handled it well if

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:19,090
you had say ten VMs maybe on 20 servers

00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:20,860
maybe as much as a hundred servers if

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,740
you were really really pushing it but it

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:26,530
was a pain to manage so the idea behind

00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:30,130
the cloud is you may have a hundred VMs

00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:33,970
each running on a thousand servers or a

00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:35,950
hundred thousand servers and because

00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,599
you're getting to that scale then you

00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:40,870
start needing tools with a slightly

00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:43,870
higher level of abstraction to simplify

00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:47,039
that that management process but it

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:50,110
really is just an infrastructure change

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,539
it's a very low level plumbing change

00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:57,210
and most of the technology is still

00:05:52,539 --> 00:06:01,240
exactly the same so what comes next

00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:04,000
here's the big question so I've made up

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,479
a word because I can I'm a linguist I

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,289
can do that ubiq so it's pronounced like

00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:14,919
unique and it comes from the same Latin

00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:19,389
root as ubiquitous computing but it's a

00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:21,490
lot easier to say so the basic idea this

00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:23,110
Latin root just means everywhere the

00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,870
idea is that you have computing

00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:28,659
everywhere so what the cloud does is it

00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:31,040
slices your computing power up instead

00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:33,050
of having a large server

00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,240
or very large installation of servers

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:38,060
that's a very manual process to create a

00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,220
new one you now have very tiny slices of

00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,110
computing power and it's very easy to

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:48,680
spin up as many more of them as you need

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:51,560
on demand now there are hints of the

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,960
future and in much the same way than

00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,660
every decade previously you saw the

00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,150
beginnings of the next decade before it

00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:02,570
fully became fully formed so the hints

00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:04,940
of ubiq are the Internet of Things the

00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:06,860
idea of a large number of tiny things

00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,410
say your refrigerator your toaster

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,600
whatever your plant waterer that have a

00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,850
connection to the internet and have

00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:17,780
behavior networked behavior because of

00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:19,850
that smartphones are another good

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,160
example where you hold in your hand

00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:24,140
computing power that's equivalent to a

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,970
crazy / computer back in the day you

00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:29,530
know that's really a lot of power you're

00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:32,720
carrying in that tiny little device and

00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:34,700
not only that you know so you don't have

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,280
gigabit internet all over the world

00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,470
certainly I have it in my apartment

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,620
which is awesome but but anywhere in the

00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:45,260
world you go anywhere with some

00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,730
exceptions but say it's a like ninety

00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,460
percent of the world you can at least

00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:51,800
get a data sim you know may not give you

00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,080
a high-speed connection but you are in

00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:59,570
some way networked to the rest of the

00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:01,610
world Google glass is not a great

00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:04,970
example it's a pretty painful prototype

00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:07,190
but it does begin to give you a hint of

00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:12,830
what it might be like to have computing

00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:14,720
power with you anywhere I Fitbit is

00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,420
another example it's just a tiny device

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,420
that takes some stats on your activity

00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,700
and then feeds that into a cloud

00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:28,190
aggregated data that sort of gives you a

00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:30,230
report on how fit you are so this is the

00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:33,320
interesting thing about the cloud the

00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:35,750
cloud itself is just deployment

00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,090
abstraction it's just plumbing it's not

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,010
really all that exciting to most of the

00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,210
world it's really exciting to like big

00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,030
companies who need to save money on

00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:44,560
deployment costs

00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:47,980
and it's exciting to those of us who

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,230
enjoy working on like compilers and web

00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,940
servers and low-level details but to

00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:55,930
most of the rest of the world they don't

00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:57,520
even notice it so it's kind of the same

00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:00,070
as the internet the internet was

00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,590
launched and nobody cared because there

00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:07,030
was no reason they should care what

00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:08,920
changes that is when like mass numbers

00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:11,980
of even non-technical human beings have

00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:16,180
a reason to use it so internet is

00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:18,880
plumbing web is mass adoption cloud is

00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:21,430
plumbing ubiquitous computing the

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:26,320
Internet of Things is mass adoption the

00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:31,630
next phase so here's a projection by

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:34,570
Gartner based on growth rates and that

00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:36,400
is the current total number of

00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:39,700
internet-connected devices in the world

00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,920
is just under five billion if growth

00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:44,740
rates continue as they have done in the

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:48,400
past few years and all signs show that

00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:50,800
they will the total number of connected

00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,900
devices including you know laptops

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,330
smartphones tablets and all the Internet

00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:58,570
of Things devices is going to be 30

00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:00,280
billion so this is very very big

00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,510
business this is big business for all

00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,730
the people who make those tiny little

00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:06,940
devices but it's also big business for

00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:10,800
projects like Apache because you make

00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,800
the plumbing that makes it happen

00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:23,440
do you care should you care so here's

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,529
the deal right apache is web web is a

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,330
cloud apache is cloud and I'm not just

00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:30,910
talking about CloudStack I'm talking

00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:33,460
about every single bit every single

00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:36,850
project in Apache is web related in one

00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:39,220
way or another so here's a little few a

00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:40,930
few stats largely because this data is

00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,180
easy to get and data on some of the

00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:48,089
other projects inside Apache or not as

00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:52,650
easy to get so httpd measured this month

00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:57,089
on the top 10 million sites in the world

00:10:52,650 --> 00:11:00,400
comprises sixty percent of web servers

00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:03,100
engine X is twenty percent I is is

00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,410
fourteen percent and from there you drop

00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:09,160
down to like the two percent sin below

00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:12,190
too much smaller if you take a look

00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:15,430
about four years ago httpd was a little

00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:17,380
bit higher at 71 percent at the time I

00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:19,810
is was twenty percent and engine X was

00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:23,560
only four percent so you can see a

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:26,950
slight trend but a lot of it is engine X

00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:31,270
stealing from I is and a little bit from

00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:35,050
Apache even so with a slight decline

00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:39,459
sixty percent is a massive share of the

00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:42,670
market absolutely massive like apache

00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:44,200
httpd owns the web we're talking like

00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:49,180
three times higher than the closest

00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:51,220
competitor okay so then you have just

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:55,720
take a step back and think why is apache

00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:58,260
so successful there's a few reasons most

00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,209
of them boil down to being free software

00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,800
so there's kind of two parts to that one

00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:06,390
part of being free software is the

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:10,930
apache way right so it's the way that

00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:12,640
apache goes about creating software to

00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:16,209
get the best possible input from the

00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:18,459
widest set of people it's about having

00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:20,529
access to the software people can just

00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:22,900
go grab it they don't have to like make

00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:26,650
a big business contract and you know get

00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,920
approval for like a big expenditure they

00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,510
can do

00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,459
grab it start prototyping play with it

00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,920
and run with it and then over time well

00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:37,510
of course will deploy with it also it's

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:40,149
a very low barrier for entry the Apache

00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:43,540
License is a very big part of of Apache

00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:47,079
success it's it's a license that allows

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,730
a very broad array of uses so just about

00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:50,500
any business that wants to build

00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,510
something on top of Apache the license

00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,320
is not an obstacle and at the same time

00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:59,230
it promotes those same businesses

00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,910
feeding back into the Apache projects

00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:05,230
and improving the Apache projects that

00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:07,209
they're benefiting from collaboration is

00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:10,149
a big part of it so that's that's a both

00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:12,190
the idea that the more people you have

00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:14,320
looking at the software the more likely

00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:16,260
they are to find and fix the problems it

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,490
makes for very very stable software and

00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:21,070
also the fact that the more people you

00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,750
have contributing the faster you can fix

00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,360
any problems as they come up and the

00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:31,750
faster you can improve the whole body of

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:33,790
software it's the way that Apache goes

00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:35,890
about bringing new projects into the

00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:38,829
fold and helping them come up to speed

00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:41,230
and understand what the Apache way is

00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:42,760
all about and how they can get the best

00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,709
benefit out of it it really is a

00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,050
jumpstart for a new project that might

00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:48,670
make hundreds of project of mistakes if

00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,290
they were left on their own to kind of

00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,510
struggle through but the fact that they

00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,910
have that guidance of those who've gone

00:13:52,510 --> 00:14:00,850
before it saves them an enormous amount

00:13:54,910 --> 00:14:03,850
of time and pain and cost and all of

00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:07,329
this kind of comes together in making it

00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:09,010
easier to innovate making it easier to

00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:13,319
bring in new features to bring in new

00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:13,319
ideas and keep adapting for the future

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,779
so it makes for a very stable stable

00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:23,199
layer in order to build the rest of the

00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:25,180
web on top of which is what you want

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:31,029
from your plumbing you want stable

00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:35,709
reliable steady foundations and it comes

00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:36,840
from a sense that creating value is more

00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:40,050
important than extra

00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:42,330
getting value there there are various

00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:43,950
different theories around around models

00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,620
of innovation of models of productivity

00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:48,840
and over and over again in free software

00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,030
we come back to the fact that the best

00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,220
way to succeed is by creating more value

00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:57,930
than your competitors not by squashing

00:14:53,220 --> 00:15:00,870
them so there's another side to free

00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,460
software and it's also important

00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:06,470
although I would say much less important

00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:10,800
and that is free software costs nothing

00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:13,050
so when you get into a cloud space when

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,570
you're talking about running like

00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:19,050
hundreds of thousands of instances of a

00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:21,120
web server the idea of paying a license

00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:24,030
fee for each instance of that web server

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,470
is absolutely insane it would crush most

00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:29,040
businesses before they could get off the

00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:31,890
ground so in fact it is a competitive

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:35,940
advantage to be free and to gain your

00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:37,650
value in other ways so the business

00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,210
models that free software has known for

00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:41,580
a long time and more and more companies

00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:46,080
are beginning to get now are to sell

00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:48,450
support sell services and selling

00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,310
content back again to the World Wide Web

00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:53,310
that's what people are willing to pay

00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:56,790
for and that's what puts the cost on the

00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:58,200
consumers instead of trying to instead

00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:03,360
of crushing the business before I can

00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:06,570
even get started so if this is the case

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,420
then what's the future well if you look

00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:11,700
at cloud architectures the biggest thing

00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:15,420
they demand again because of the scale

00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:21,600
is software that's smaller lighter and

00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:24,150
faster so I'm again unix graybeard here

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,880
I remember a time when mod perl was

00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:29,280
really exciting because you could load

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,380
all of your modules into memory at once

00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,740
and it improved performance because

00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,940
everything was loaded in memory at once

00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,010
if you go out and start looking around

00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,260
for help on Apache now what you'll see

00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:43,170
is lots and lots of tips on how to not

00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:45,240
load mod PHP so you can avoid the pre

00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,890
for can p.m. and use the worker NPM and

00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,940
save an enormous amount of memory

00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,250
because you're not loading everything

00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:55,050
into memory at once so complete

00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:57,240
is it everything coming full circle in a

00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:59,520
way or you'll see talked about using the

00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:03,690
event mpm to get to handle workloads

00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:05,760
like engine X is sort of popular for the

00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:09,829
same sort of very light fast very low

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,060
memory low consumption workloads so

00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:14,220
there's no truck there's no trouble at

00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:17,130
all adapting to the new model in fact

00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,510
I'd say Apache already has it's just

00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:23,640
something to keep in mind as the future

00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:26,010
keeps marching forward so if you're

00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,920
interested in helping Apache is web web

00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:32,310
is cloud patchy is cloud what should you

00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:35,130
do honestly just keep doing what you're

00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:39,150
doing you're doing a great job I have no

00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:41,310
complaints whatsoever keep up keep

00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:46,980
maintaining this the software that you

00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:48,630
have and that's both bug fixes and just

00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:52,140
being responsive to the needs of the

00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:55,140
users keep adding new features as you

00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,790
see a demand in the market keep adding

00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:00,960
new features shifting the features you

00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:03,270
have just keep growing and changing make

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,550
sure if you are an expert in an area

00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:09,480
that you are teaching at least two other

00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:12,840
people how to do that because you won't

00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,160
be around forever and as needs grow you

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,440
will need more people to do it even

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,870
right now so make sure you teach other

00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,250
people make sure you yourself keep

00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:22,410
learning even if you feel like you're an

00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,270
expert in one domain learn more about

00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,490
other Apache projects learn more about

00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:28,890
projects that are outside Apache

00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:30,810
entirely learn the competitive

00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:34,520
advantages learn what kinds of features

00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:37,950
you might need to adapt and improve and

00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:41,190
make sure you don't forget the

00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:43,710
non-technical pieces of Apache because

00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:47,810
if you focus only on technology it's

00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:51,330
very easy to fracture and fall apart

00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:53,430
events like this and communal community

00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,020
building the way you talk to each other

00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:57,120
on a mailing list the way you build

00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:00,210
relationships with each other that's

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,220
what keeps Apache strong for a very very

00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:05,419
long time

00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:08,690
the future PAP she's been around for

00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:10,220
almost 20 years all the signs say that

00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:14,600
it will be around for at least another

00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:16,070
20 years so that means you kind of have

00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,780
to take a different perspective than you

00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:20,659
might have in the very early days I

00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:22,610
don't know if anybody in 1995 was really

00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:25,220
thinking about what Apache would be 20

00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:28,070
years into the future but now you kind

00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,809
of have to and it means what you're

00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,820
looking at is not just what should be

00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:34,549
doing we be doing next year but how do

00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:40,809
we make this project sustainable for the

00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:40,809
