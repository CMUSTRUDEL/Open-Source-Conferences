in the past few years I have been

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:10,290
working mostly on the hot dog projects

00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:15,719
under a patch book so currently I'm a

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:20,130
PMC member for Apache high in the

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:24,359
century and also a commuter for Apache

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:27,029
peak so today I'm going to talk up

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:30,810
mostly about Apache hives new command

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:32,969
line tool called benign this is supposed

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:37,250
to be more like an information or rather

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:41,910
than technical so I expect it's easy

00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:44,010
here's my outline of my talk for psych-k

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:48,570
I or given you some background

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:52,850
information about how high has evolved

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:59,270
during in the over the years from

00:00:52,850 --> 00:01:04,229
command line command line tour to for

00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:10,860
db2 database for for Big Data then I

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:13,710
will discuss a little bit more about how

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,750
we would use a pin line as the command

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,890
iron to achieve what are you use what to

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:24,689
do with haiwa CLI the order can iron

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:27,860
command line COI there I were given

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:30,930
interviewed about like a future work

00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:33,350
belong and where you might have be able

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:40,740
to find the additional information of

00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:44,070
course Q&A at the end so in the past few

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:49,740
years approach higher has accounts you

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:55,740
over the Saros stages affirm I got just

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:58,820
a common I'm a tour that executes users

00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,829
query in the transforming into

00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:10,140
MapReduce jobs in a cattle reserve back

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:12,090
to the to the client later on hive

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:15,200
server why is created most of you to

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,200
solve the problem of

00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:23,700
the the limitation on Highway Co I pick

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,640
because high CRI is a communitarian

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,250
towards great it can do everything you

00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:32,610
actually read has a the optimization

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:35,760
pretty much everything but what do you

00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:39,780
for you want to execute they say a puri

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,209
from from your Python script or if you

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,250
want to integrate this type the

00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:47,670
functionality that high provides the way

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:50,640
to RBI tours so the the Covenant or

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:53,910
doesn't want people want to provide the

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,310
you that so that's so that's why leader

00:02:53,910 --> 00:03:00,420
higher cumulative created a higher

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:06,000
server one and in the make the high was

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:11,220
tours hive COI is thinner with that as a

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:15,840
command I come on a tour or command-line

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:17,880
client however harvester one also have

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,010
the each have a big apartment that

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,930
mostly is a concurrency so that's why

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:27,419
high community created a hive server to

00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:30,269
recently and with the benign a new

00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:33,470
client command i CRI as the commodity as

00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:38,160
the as the client as the standard client

00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:42,720
so looking at is the three stages that

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:46,069
hive has evolved from it has it has the

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,290
pretty much the same functionalities but

00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:55,379
the Opera TR provide us a quote in her

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:58,790
face to make the user is easy to use use

00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:01,530
the heart what a hot apple can provide

00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:07,040
of course it executes to the queries

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:11,849
using using MapReduce

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:15,120
so let's look at the each of the

00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:16,889
configurations we talked about so these

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:22,260
three configurations are still possible

00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:24,599
human today so cry OCR is that we talked

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,919
about earlier it's a command line

00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:28,169
interface

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,590
it's how we waited and it's a

00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:36,469
self-contained it has everything like

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:41,939
the driver the passer the optimizer the

00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:44,909
the pure execution execution engine in

00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:47,069
the our shorter the minister so in a

00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:48,870
pretty much everything

00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:50,819
but of course they'd only support a

00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:54,449
single user who ever launched the

00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:57,150
counter process can can to to get its

00:04:54,449 --> 00:05:00,840
functionality but there's no

00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:03,810
authentication the authentication is it

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:09,259
really depends on the underlying hadoop

00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:13,500
system and it's simple its its auto

00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:16,129
autonomous so pity we do not have us

00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:22,770
your eyes you're widely used mostly for

00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:26,490
debugging or testing so the problem with

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:29,300
the hive CRI is it's as we said that

00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:32,580
there's a limitation how I was here I

00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,319
come online to this command it's the

00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,710
only way you can gain access to the

00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:42,120
functionality so you you cannot

00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:45,479
integrate with with the other tours for

00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:48,719
example some P I tours require you have

00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:54,740
a JDBC connection of course it cannot

00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:57,270
integrate with the hive CRI or it has no

00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:02,089
programming into a programming interface

00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:07,129
the way to other language like a paisa

00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:09,960
so that's why hives hive community

00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:13,099
develop their hives or awhile so by

00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:17,639
chopping the the CLI into two components

00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:20,339
so the it'll extract the main components

00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:23,639
of such as the driver the passer the

00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:27,150
optimizer the query engine and and the

00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:28,620
embodied master into a component we

00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,020
called hives arawa

00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:34,560
and the rest is left on the client side

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,449
in the provide communication

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,320
communication protocol between the

00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:43,260
client and the server

00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:47,820
so we did that with these three of the

00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:49,889
API it allows a variety of clients using

00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,720
different programming languages to

00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:55,320
access it ease of function energy

00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:59,820
provided by a hive server one collector

00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:02,220
client can be remote so still there are

00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:05,389
some other problems with the hive server

00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:09,000
one so most of the notable is the

00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:11,570
concurrency so it only human though it

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,210
doesn't reject multiple connections but

00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:18,330
in fact it is so much there's only one

00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:20,790
one connection and all the second state

00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:24,560
is a certain in the thread local

00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:27,060
variable so if you have a multiple

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:31,650
client so you can think there's no way

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:38,220
to know one session is true from the

00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:42,770
other sessions and also there the JDBC

00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:45,270
third the JDBC ODBC interface provided

00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:49,860
however today there are also limitations

00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:52,740
over there mostly there's no no

00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:56,370
synchronous execution supported on a

00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:59,430
JDBC and there's certainly no way

00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:02,310
talking the water capability of the

00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:04,340
server provides all right there's no way

00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:09,000
to cancel your theory

00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:13,410
so with that so the community develop a

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,600
new server called hive server to to

00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:18,750
solve with concur mostly the concurrency

00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:22,550
problem but I also enhance the JDBC ODBC

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:25,650
connection so why the community decided

00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:29,700
like a fixity or the house or one rather

00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:32,400
than create a new new new server so I

00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:36,270
think the problem with the reasons are

00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:40,169
there are two reasons first the there

00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:42,479
are there's a design flaw on T or the

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:47,310
hive server one especially on the

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:49,890
highway P is the the thrift ap is to fix

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,290
that a problem it's a lot of work maybe

00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:54,690
it's

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:57,060
up to the same effort as a create a new

00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:00,750
new server secondly there's a

00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:02,640
compatibility problem so when this order

00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:08,220
3 for a PR provided that there are

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:10,560
people using this API to to to integrate

00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:14,970
with other programming language or other

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:17,130
other product so if you fix the the 3/4

00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:19,290
API then you prepare your community so

00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:22,230
to maintain the back working bility

00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:25,200
would be a headache as well so so that's

00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:28,580
why the hyper community in the past I

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,770
think a 2 year probably 2 years ago we

00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:34,710
have a server treaty introduced so again

00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:39,060
it's a server in the current model and

00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:43,380
it a lot la a variety of client using

00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:45,920
thrift so it is supports multiple user

00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,720
concurrency and it has enhanced

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,870
authentication such as a Kerberos or or

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,720
human error tab and it has better

00:09:51,870 --> 00:10:01,650
support for JDBC ODBC for example you

00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:04,320
can cancel your query and or you can you

00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:07,860
you can do the a synchronous execution

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,380
and also you can get the capability of

00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:13,560
the server so that the client can can

00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:16,340
react accordingly so it

00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:20,780
at the same time belong is also per

00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:26,250
provided as the standard command line

00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:28,710
tour for for hive server to so so high

00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,660
server to avoid benign is the

00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:36,660
recommended solution by the hive

00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:38,940
community and hive server one with with

00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:42,800
the higher with the hive 0 I is

00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:47,160
deprecated so I strongly recommend

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,920
migrating to hive server 2 now so let's

00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:53,070
look at a little closer look at the P

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:56,430
line as we said the belong is hive

00:10:53,070 --> 00:11:00,000
server two COI

00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:02,190
it it's based on psycho lion so Sakura

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:08,130
is an open source

00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:10,980
open source project that appeared build

00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:14,280
up as the interface to two JDBC

00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:16,880
supported servers one of the community

00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:19,860
today is made a copy of the code and

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:23,820
faded into the needs of a high of a

00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:26,490
server to so so the connection to from

00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:31,740
benign to hive server to is a JDBC based

00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:35,750
and JD of of course the JDBC driver that

00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:39,150
implemented by hive server server to is

00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:45,060
again using high was the hive server 2/3

00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:47,370
of the api's please note that p9 is not

00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:51,990
a comparable with the orders our hive

00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:55,020
server one so it's not possible so the

00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:58,290
question I think is for a lot of book

00:11:55,020 --> 00:12:01,110
customer or users is a to migrate it's

00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:05,310
to migrate from hives or one with the

00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:10,320
hives ERI to however so true with benign

00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:12,360
as the community or so it's not that of

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,060
complicated but it's not as simple as

00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:19,890
the changing the executable name from

00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:24,720
like a high to be 9 so it a new table a

00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:26,940
trip adjustment my beanie did so the

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,760
following talking will be focused on how

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,980
you to the migration how you would have

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,720
migrated to your script to using a p9

00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:38,280
instead of the order high of COI

00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,670
so first of all let's look at the server

00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:43,320
connections so when you launch your

00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:47,580
client or how do you connect to a remote

00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:50,610
server hives or one so in the order

00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:53,250
hives here are you would've use you are

00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:56,430
provided the collection parameters such

00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:59,280
as the host name and the another

00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:05,400
optionally the port number in a maker

00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:08,070
connection so it's a 149

00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:10,740
because it's a JDBC based so what the

00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:13,339
kinetic parameter is it is actually just

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,339
a URI

00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:18,930
the you are of alpha t out of the server

00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:22,279
of her the in the you are you have the

00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:25,529
hostname in a port number and you can

00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:28,320
this if you look at the syntax it has a

00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:31,769
hostname port number and also it has the

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,839
TP you can choose your default EP if you

00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:37,290
don quixote Palayam you work as data for

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,329
TB and and the and that there are

00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:41,190
several other components as well for

00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:45,510
example you know URL you can specify the

00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:47,070
session configuration variables such

00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:49,589
variables such as username and a

00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:54,889
password or the principal for your

00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:57,660
caboose caboose connection or followed

00:13:54,889 --> 00:14:00,120
with the pure restrain you can specify a

00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:05,120
list of for higher configuration

00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:09,889
variables such as the number of reducers

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:12,000
turn on certain optimum certain

00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:16,500
optimization feature or turn off

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:20,690
something else and the hoshi portion of

00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:22,440
the URL you can give a provide a list of

00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:25,100
high variables

00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:28,829
what are you whatever the user defines

00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:35,579
so at the bottom of this page there's a

00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:39,690
there's a you are example so it has the

00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:42,209
you are contains the the the components

00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:45,870
that I mentioned about like username

00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:48,870
password in D in as the session

00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:51,899
variables and you can also space it also

00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:55,370
specify like a the configuration work

00:14:51,899 --> 00:15:03,990
variable values as well as user defined

00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:05,880
variable values so when you so with the

00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:12,930
client of course you want to ask you

00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:17,519
some questions provided by both high CRI

00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:20,370
and p9 so to they are identical so the

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,740
example you can see that if you can have

00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:24,690
two ways to execute a quick axial your

00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,589
pair is first of all you can use the -

00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,330
eg options

00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:29,940
followed by your

00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:32,850
whatever the pier is you have in quotes

00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:36,690
and the second option is that actually f

00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:41,279
of G you give your file name for your

00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:45,000
script so they are identical so the

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:48,630
migration it is supposed to be easy if

00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:53,820
there is no - year or - enough options

00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:57,089
given so both high of CRI or p9 where we

00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:59,010
are going to interactive mode so in the

00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:02,640
interactive mode the queries are

00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:07,230
executed nine by nine so here is an

00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:10,529
example for for hive COI you can type

00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:15,779
your so when you start in active mode it

00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:17,160
has this prompt high with with this role

00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:19,950
and it should say you can type in any

00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,870
commands simple commands like a shorty

00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:25,980
debase is now give me your result

00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:28,920
printed on the screen so the other way

00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:31,560
the other thing that you can do with the

00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:36,480
high CRI interactive mode is you can

00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:39,930
execute any sir commander using this pen

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:43,470
notation so you can say see the content

00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:46,110
of the file or you can list whatever the

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:50,630
files you have way essentially any sure

00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:56,250
commands that that you can do at your

00:16:50,630 --> 00:17:01,680
reviewer terminal so interactive mode is

00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:04,679
also supported by p9 so here is you how

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,449
you execute a PRA so you it's clean in

00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,459
the same way it's just a prompt is a

00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:12,959
little bit differently to show you the

00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:14,790
current connection but the way to cable

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,510
your Puri is the same you see sugar

00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:24,829
database is and it can provide you a

00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:27,710
nice tabular output so that the pub

00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:32,790
commander is actually the equivalent to

00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:35,220
to the pen Cinco commander pencil Co HD

00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:37,800
is the command provided benign so you

00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:40,770
can use in Europe they are the same it's

00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:44,280
just the pain cycle can be

00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:47,940
scaped so I don't see any reason not why

00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:56,310
not so so so for simplicity you just

00:17:47,940 --> 00:18:02,060
type any sequel command notice Judy busy

00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:02,060
for a Jedi bee hive server - yeah sure

00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:20,850
well not only in her active mode but

00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,620
it's probably I never tried about might

00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:25,710
be possible that you for used to the -

00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,990
eg option right so you're - hi - eg

00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:32,400
option whatever the share command then

00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:33,300
you were - pipe to the subsequent she

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,460
shared man

00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:43,170
so I I think I is possible but I never

00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:45,600
tried so yes the pair yeah that this is

00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:49,650
supported by p9 but unfortunately

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:54,300
because the pen is used by the p9 to

00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:55,980
execute the sick belay commands so first

00:18:54,300 --> 00:19:00,210
years of that connection you can connect

00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:01,890
to a highway server actually you can you

00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:05,010
know have a make a multiple connections

00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:09,500
or you can closer connection or you can

00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:12,480
create create the belonging process

00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:16,050
since that these paints already used so

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:20,480
there's no way for benign to provide the

00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:23,700
same syntax to execute a sure command

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:29,000
however there's ongoing interior hi was

00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:31,170
66 94 is true to provide the same way

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,990
not the same way about a similar

00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:39,420
provided similar functionality allow you

00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:41,280
to execute a sequel any share command so

00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:44,400
the current proposal would be used to

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,800
ban is age to a cure than any share

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:53,400
command so there would be a network

00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:59,309
difference so it's also possible to

00:19:53,400 --> 00:20:01,679
start hi the COI or belong into impacted

00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:03,480
motor so he invited model is everything

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,990
it's the same process in a client

00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:14,400
process I provided you a quicker way to

00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:18,360
tip arc or task to the testing to to

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:21,000
start a hi William he embedded model all

00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,730
you need to do is to type Ohio without

00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,650
any connection parameters so it'll your

00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:28,260
launch

00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:31,650
impacted highway server one and the

00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:35,900
medium Patti - hi master

00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:38,520
so Pilar is a little bit different so

00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:42,120
whether a the coast into in patty motor

00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:46,080
it depends on the URL you came so if

00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:48,300
you're given this particular URL you and

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:53,310
the time you start benign it we're

00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:55,830
starting in panic mode also either it's

00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:59,940
also possible that you interactive made

00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:03,750
mode the p9 you started be lying and you

00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:06,180
say use the bank connect command benign

00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:09,360
commander keyword certain you are it's

00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:11,960
the same same you are it also started in

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,960
command and I

00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:22,519
so if I provide the URL delegates

00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:25,009
everything to the server if I don't

00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:26,929
provide the URL it will essentially run

00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:29,570
the server locally or when you're saying

00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:32,539
embedded what is embedded embedded

00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:35,029
busines means in the same client process

00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:38,480
it started everything starts it starts

00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:40,700
getting bad either hives or to wait in

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,159
value too high hi master

00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:46,700
if you don't provide the URL no that's

00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:49,399
for the order high CRI but for benign

00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:54,529
you got to provide this particular URL

00:21:49,399 --> 00:21:57,379
to starting in padded mode but the URL

00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:59,360
is the hive server I want to talk to ya

00:21:57,379 --> 00:22:02,360
but they said I'll see if there's a no

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,340
hostname port number right so oh you

00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,100
were just yeah it's kind of a marker

00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,750
yeah yeah say okay you okay with this

00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,610
that's me so you want me to even bad you

00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:14,259
the mode oh but if I have a host port

00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:23,809
then yeah right exactly

00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:26,149
sure so the next topic is actually is

00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:28,639
very powerful and very important for a

00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:32,659
lot of for hive users that's the

00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:34,460
variables in a variable substitution so

00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:38,059
there are four types of variables like a

00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:40,190
hive account that represents high will

00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:44,389
configuration variables such as the

00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:45,889
number of reducers turn on turning on a

00:22:44,389 --> 00:22:48,649
particular feature or turn off a

00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:51,080
particular feature and the system

00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:54,889
variables that you you care from the

00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:57,679
system when I could always named nope

00:22:54,889 --> 00:22:59,450
locale something like that and the

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,659
environmental variables that's what are

00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:05,389
your inherited from the environment tell

00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:08,419
you when you start start the hive server

00:23:05,389 --> 00:23:10,970
oh hi variable that's a for for a user

00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:16,490
to use for whatever purpose in their

00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:18,950
script so we're both prefixed so there

00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:20,480
you can prefix with you drop them so

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:23,659
that to differentiate the one from the

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:27,139
other category except at the high bar

00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:30,259
you can skip the high wire repeat prefix

00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:31,040
so the syntax for the variable the full

00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:33,560
name would I be

00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:36,590
the prefix followed by colon forum

00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:40,730
followed by verbal name so the way to

00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:45,320
refer to the value of the of the verbal

00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:49,010
use the dollar curly brackets notation

00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:50,950
this is an example this is your use this

00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:53,450
in your square basically means you see

00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:59,570
that my square with the value of for

00:23:53,450 --> 00:24:02,690
this particular particular variable so

00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:06,740
how do we define where boss so here we

00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:08,510
define hime variables there for for the

00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:11,060
order hives here are you can there are

00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:14,600
three ways you can Twitter - et followed

00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:20,120
by key value pair or the long options -

00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:25,970
- define or - - hi bar followed by a key

00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:28,700
value pair 25 hi we're both in p9

00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:30,380
there's only one choice that you use we

00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:33,110
kind of standardized into this - a

00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:36,950
notation like a - - hi work followed by

00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:38,870
a key value pair defining hi we come

00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:41,000
from variables is telling you a similar

00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:43,700
way for purpose they actually that they

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,480
are identical the you know you can only

00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:53,480
use - - hi curve followed by a key value

00:24:47,480 --> 00:25:00,320
pair to give to define define the cover

00:24:53,480 --> 00:25:03,470
boy and the command line so it is also

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:06,310
possible in active mode that you set or

00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:10,340
reset the value for for your variables

00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:14,450
here is an example nice you in the order

00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:16,130
five CRI as well as in p9 you can do the

00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:19,850
same command you to the set the word

00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:21,800
problem report to the new value here the

00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:24,650
examples here you can change the OS name

00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,420
right to something else I don't know

00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:28,130
there's a reason to do this but this

00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,560
just to show you that what you can do

00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:35,780
what you can change it to the value of

00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:38,090
for your for your variable and please

00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:41,390
note that environmental variables cannot

00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:44,330
be reset because these well these values

00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:44,950
these are wearables are derived from the

00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,020
you are

00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:52,080
- we're going when you start a server so

00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:55,650
there's no no point - to change them so

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:58,540
if you try to do that you work at a

00:25:55,650 --> 00:26:01,420
cutter error messages like this of

00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:04,030
course right now p9 there are some

00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:06,790
problem where the displays nothing but

00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:13,150
they don't assume that your your command

00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:15,070
winter through so you can shoot the

00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:17,890
current value of a variable by use the

00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:20,650
set command followed by by the variable

00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:28,000
name so for posts and T are the

00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:30,880
identical proposed C Ohio CRI and p9 so

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,050
also there is a problem we'd be lying

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:39,790
where it doesn't display the value so

00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:42,160
that's a that's a park there even though

00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:45,340
the syntax is the same I mean how you

00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:49,600
said that we report it has the same

00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:52,060
syntax so you for you to set command

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,790
without giving any variable name either

00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:57,280
we're displaying a list of commands and

00:26:54,790 --> 00:27:00,310
these are lists of verbose with their

00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,420
values so that's a good way to find out

00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:05,170
what's your server's configuration

00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:09,100
what's the variables you said what value

00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:14,140
it is derived from the environment so

00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:16,030
they are identical so in the same set

00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:18,010
there are so many commands is hard to

00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:21,370
remember which but don't worry the third

00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:24,070
command I help to trigger the Cabana

00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:27,670
happen slightly differently between the

00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:30,730
two so for high occo i you use a dash

00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:34,870
capital edge to get the list of commands

00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:40,540
possible mr. benign options but for

00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:49,200
polite has a shirt - age option or that

00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:49,200
longer option an option - - help yes

00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:01,110
well it is it issue I'm sure all the

00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:04,210
other variables in the four categories

00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:09,850
yeah it's a quite a long list if you try

00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:11,680
you know so help is also possible you

00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:14,380
know you know you know you know active

00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:17,710
mode for pline so you can use the pan

00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:22,000
help that's that that's the command

00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:23,740
provided by p9 so you can use ensure

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,810
together all the possible commands that

00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:31,630
you can use the interactive mode of

00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:33,820
unfortunately high of CRI has no no help

00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:35,860
are you interactive mode because there

00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:40,750
are only two things that you can do

00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:48,490
either a single command or pairing or

00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:50,320
just as executor share command so that's

00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:53,710
pretty much that

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:59,590
what are you what what you would do to

00:28:53,710 --> 00:29:04,120
migrate to using p9 from the order hive

00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:08,920
COI so here is the some more work that

00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:12,070
needs to be done so they're arming to to

00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:15,460
caps that we see which are seeing it's

00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:19,690
missing from below so the first one is

00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:24,580
the p9 right has never accepted sei

00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:28,750
option so Tasha option is used to to

00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:32,800
initialize your just your session or

00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:36,310
your or your server when you start when

00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:39,930
you start your client so so in the

00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:43,660
orders hives ERI it is possible you can

00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:46,300
you can use that I followed by a script

00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:49,180
that you want to run every time when you

00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:53,860
start at the current but a p9 doesn't

00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:56,820
provide that so we have an ongoing here

00:29:53,860 --> 00:30:00,460
for that hopefully they will come soon

00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:02,560
so another cap as we see is that there's

00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:05,710
no way to execute a share command we

00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:07,120
already discussed with that in Pinay so

00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,800
of course there are a number of bugs

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:13,420
some are we already mentioned but

00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:16,950
more so I'm sure if you use b9 more you

00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:19,260
will find more bugs please feel free to

00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:22,000
report

00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:25,570
so here it's the places where you can

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,330
get more information about highway in

00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:31,180
general so this the first one is the

00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:32,980
wicked week high wiki in the this

00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:35,820
section specific talking about hive

00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:39,490
server 2 and hive server to client

00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:41,680
clients and also if you need more

00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:45,330
information on the same topic please

00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:49,390
refer to the blog post that I have and

00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:51,040
also the hives documentation on the

00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:54,340
second line is quite limited

00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:57,810
so because beeline is derived from CQ

00:30:54,340 --> 00:31:00,910
line so you can get a lot of more

00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:05,350
documentation from secure line

00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:09,960
CQ lines you are on webpage so that

00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:09,960
concludes my talk so any more questions

00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:23,039
does it have an impact on clouded away

00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:25,980
we can run the cloud era Huey you yeah

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:31,080
here whether you can ramp in I in

00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:33,419
cordera you yeah well well Pina is the

00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,730
camera and tool I think are from here

00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:37,679
you can you can connect to have server

00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:39,570
to and around any commands or or

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:52,380
recommend that you can do use it we will

00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:53,820
be nigh okay Rick is it like the

00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:56,280
backward compatible with all the

00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:58,500
previously what am i back power

00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:01,559
comparability the the command syntax

00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:04,289
yeah so as we discussed most of what are

00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:06,360
the same but there are variations for

00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:16,409
the Cinco Cinco synthesis these are the

00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:18,740
same you know alright thank you very

00:32:16,409 --> 00:32:18,740
