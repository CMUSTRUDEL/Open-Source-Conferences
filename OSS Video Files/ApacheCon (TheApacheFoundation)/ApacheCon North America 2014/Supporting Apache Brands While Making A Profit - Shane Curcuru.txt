so an introduction up my name is Shane

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,569
Kirk room I currently serve as the vice

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,639
president of brand management for the

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:10,620
apache software foundation so this is a

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,650
volunteer position appointed by the

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,599
board of directors at the foundation and

00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:18,359
my responsibility is to define brand

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,449
policy for all 180 Apache project

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,699
communities and I've been around at

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,859
Apache since 1999 so the key thing to

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,109
remember is any questions you have send

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,400
them to trade marks at patty org that's

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,560
where we can answer any sort of brand

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,680
related issue from inside the community

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:38,550
outside community anyone so what do what

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,140
we want to talk about today so when I

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,270
was talking thinking about how to get

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,059
across what I want to present and how to

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,989
think about what you want to learn the

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,120
important thing to me is figuring out

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,789
why we have our policies the way they

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,000
are so I want to start by talking about

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,559
what is Apache so what is the foundation

00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,660
don't talk about what the Apache brand

00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,489
the Apache brand means because if we

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,899
can't define something then it's not

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:02,160
very easy to say well you can do this

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,559
you can't do that if you know what it is

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,270
and of course you know the interesting

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,700
thing perhaps for most of you is what

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:13,439
can you do with Apache project brands

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,970
like Apache CloudStack and the the giant

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,580
elephant in the room we have to talk

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,799
briefly about brand enforcement should

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,650
never happen but just in case we can do

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,479
that and we probably will have time for

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,680
questions here in the session today but

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,210
I will be here for the rest of the

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,689
conference and happy to meet with

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:34,560
everybody so what is the apache software

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:36,930
foundation so in terms of structure in

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,820
terms of the organization itself what is

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:44,100
it so we are a 501 C 3 Membership

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,470
Corporation so we have a nine-member

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,869
board of directors directors are elected

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,840
from the membership by individual

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:53,579
members so this is very unlike let

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,840
expound ation or eclipse where there's

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,790
like corporate involvement in the

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,399
governance this is purely individual

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,590
governments we have a corporate

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,149
sponsorship program and I know that a

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,729
number of our corporate sponsors in

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:08,580
terms of of sponsoring the asf are here

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:11,340
we thank them very much between that and

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,300
between individual donations that covers

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,010
one hundred percent of

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,850
the Foundation's funding and that covers

00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,280
750,000 dollar annual budget

00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,960
approximately mostly for hardware and

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,510
sis have been contractors as you'd

00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:28,650
expect we also spend on publicity events

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:31,790
and few other things including brand so

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:35,160
lot why is this important why do we care

00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,870
governance is critical to how the

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,150
foundation operates both the foundation

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,850
as a whole as well as all our project

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,650
communities like Apache CloudStack so

00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,570
the board appoints executive officers

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,330
and corporate officers like myself we

00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:51,180
set policy and direct and excuse not

00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:55,530
Direction policy for all projects very

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:57,570
core policy the board also creates a

00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,830
vice president and chair as we had this

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,200
morning of the change of the chair of

00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,210
Apache CloudStack which is great and

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,390
project management committees to manage

00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:09,030
projects so within the few policies that

00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:11,490
we set foundation wide projects have

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,590
complete technical direction and brand

00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,840
direction and so on that's what the

00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:20,640
project decides for itself we we do not

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:23,130
dictate any of that so a key thing to

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,520
note here is that all these governance

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:28,680
positions all the people setting policy

00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:32,459
all of the PMC members we view as

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,459
volunteers so none of the people that

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:39,030
Apache are paid by Apache we have some

00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:40,410
contractors but no employees so the way

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,880
that our governance has done is by the

00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,860
individuals who have shown the mayor in

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:48,060
the communities within the foundation so

00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:50,459
on who set the policy so this is the

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:54,120
most important thing to explain to start

00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:57,030
off with is the why of why we have our

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,070
brand policies the details are difficult

00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,570
trademark questions are always it

00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,270
depends you know show me the actual

00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:06,209
example we can't cover all that but if

00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:08,489
you can understand what we believe and

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:12,019
where the foundation and our projects

00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:14,519
are coming from then you can see what

00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:17,370
you know that makes much easier to

00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,690
understand the concepts so if you don't

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,810
bring home anything else I want people

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,550
to understand this message for this is

00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,050
who we are as the foundation in our

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,159
projects

00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:29,509
so we have different goals than most of

00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:31,159
you out there especially from software

00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:33,199
vendors and posters and providers and so

00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:35,690
on now they're not incompatible goals at

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,580
all in fact they're very compatible but

00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,860
the fundamentals of how we set our

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:43,159
policies and how we govern our projects

00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:45,560
this is critical so the mission of the

00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:47,750
foundation is to provide software for

00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,259
the public good or public charity and

00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:53,930
that fact truly when you really get down

00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:57,740
to making hard policy decisions that is

00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:59,389
our core that's what we optimize for now

00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,210
the method that we use is also critical

00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:04,150
the method is the foundation will

00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:07,639
provide a stable and independent home

00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,919
for like minded project communities so

00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:12,860
people who want to work in our way which

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,120
you know a literal out of now we want to

00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,129
make sure they have a home that we

00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,960
support them we provide the projects

00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:19,849
with the services they need and the

00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,069
backup for continuing that governance

00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:23,240
model and the project model so it's

00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:25,159
really the communities who are doing our

00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,639
work we provide we enable that to happen

00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:30,169
and some people ask was so at the

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,120
foundation level so what's your goal

00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:34,270
what's your five-year plan and it's kind

00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,370
of funny to say that the foundation

00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:40,099
doesn't have a direction we don't pick

00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,990
the projects that come to us our mission

00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:44,120
at the foundation is to be a public

00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,699
charity be public good and our goal is

00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,370
to be here in 50 years because we know

00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:50,539
that if we're still here in 50 years we

00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,219
will still have interested project

00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:54,229
communities who are creating innovative

00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:57,500
and new software that we can then give

00:05:54,229 --> 00:06:00,139
away for the good of the world so this

00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,000
is the why of Apache and this is

00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:04,759
important to understand when we talk

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,229
about complex things like different

00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:11,029
vendors all wanting to use part of our

00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:14,060
brands so let's define what is the

00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:15,020
Apache brand itself and I'm sure that

00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,419
people in this room will notice the

00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:21,349
little our symbol so Apache actually is

00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:23,300
a registered trademark now thank you so

00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:25,159
the Apache brand in terms of the

00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:29,779
foundation as well as part of every

00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:31,400
project brand has a specific meaning to

00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:32,930
us so the Apache brain is really our

00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,849
house brand for community built software

00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,649
so hopefully it's not a surprise to

00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:37,460
anyone to read the things on the slide

00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:40,100
in terms of

00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:43,789
the we use a pragmatic and permissive

00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:45,319
Apache License the PMC's by merit vote

00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:48,490
in people they make their own technical

00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:50,599
decisions on behalf of the project

00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,580
openly developed so everything's on the

00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:55,220
public mailing list all those things

00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,470
enable new contributors to come in and

00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,630
learn about the project easily and feel

00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,910
hopefully that they can participate and

00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:04,780
if they participate that they will be

00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:08,060
taken seriously and perhaps invited in

00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:10,699
so one note about the Apache brand and

00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,440
the feather by itself is those two

00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:14,990
brands are special to the foundation and

00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:17,960
to its membership but we have a very a

00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,340
lot of us a very personal relationship

00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,780
with the Apache brand because we have

00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,080
been building it for the past 15 years

00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:26,120
so the Apache brand is really special to

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,729
us and is different than all of our

00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,740
project brands that's just a note to to

00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:32,300
file in the back your head so what are

00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,699
their project brands obviously we know

00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,819
CloudStack but these these policies and

00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:41,990
these the whys of our policies apply to

00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:43,699
all Apache projects so this is one way

00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,099
that we ensure that we have some sense

00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:48,139
of community and also that we you know

00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:49,909
most leverage the Apache brand for our

00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:52,340
projects as well as leverage our

00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:55,250
projects reputation for Apache is ensure

00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:57,050
that every project is Apache foo so

00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,699
Apache CloudStack it's important to have

00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:03,050
the Apache in front of it very much

00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:06,560
thank you so within the core guidelines

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:09,409
and requirements of project branding and

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,750
legal guidelines and so on every PMC is

00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:13,400
free to do their own brand and we have

00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,830
great examples like cloudstack and few

00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,050
other projects and we have some kind of

00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:20,270
boring examples like some other projects

00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:22,070
but that's up to the the project we

00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,330
don't dictate any of that I mean if the

00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:32,539
project is passionate about it they'll

00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:34,459
do it so a key part part of our overall

00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:36,919
policy as well the project's define and

00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:38,990
manage their own brands the foundation

00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:41,750
owns all trademarks on behalf of our

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:44,270
projects so this is a key control

00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:47,060
mechanism to ensure our project

00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:48,890
independence and we also ask that

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,140
everybody please treat all Apache

00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:53,150
project and product names as trade

00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,610
works LT asf that's not always clear to

00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:57,830
some users in fact it's not clear to

00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,170
some users who should know that hey it's

00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:01,670
suffer product straight mark I don't

00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,560
sense that in this room CloudStack is a

00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:05,060
great place to have this talk is like I

00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:08,330
get the feeling a lot of you already get

00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:10,370
this but I have to say that so a

00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:12,800
friendly reminder which is like I just

00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:15,050
said not for this room I would imagine

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:20,780
but it clearly is for some other rooms

00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:22,790
is it's not your brand so you know the

00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,320
donor of this project has done a great

00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,150
job in the process of going through

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,810
incubation and going from the air

00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:31,640
product to a patchy cloud stack and just

00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:33,560
this morning a number of people talking

00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,320
about you know we want to make Apache

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,850
CloudStack be successful and yeah I'm

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,440
I've got my badge over here but I want

00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,930
to make a patchy clouds exocet

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,110
successful so this is a great success

00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:49,580
story but this is important because when

00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:51,920
it's the Apache brand we know that part

00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:55,400
of the Apache brand is independence so

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,440
when another vendor or or a small

00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,610
consultant or you know someone just

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,650
starting their career wanting to make a

00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,360
noise for themselves know is if they

00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:04,400
show up on the list they will have a

00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,410
chance of being accepted getting in

00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,390
influencing the project and it's not

00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,860
going to be dominated by one vendor who

00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,930
will lock all the people out that's

00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:15,830
critical to the Apache ground and to all

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:19,790
of our projects so what is the trademark

00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:21,260
policy I'm not going to read the policy

00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,160
that's on the website or read bullets to

00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,640
you because I'm you know want to hear

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,400
that any more than I want to say it the

00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,720
purpose the why the deeper understanding

00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,230
of what the policies actually are is

00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:36,350
that the foundation needs to maintain

00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:38,240
our ability to defend our projects

00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:41,720
brands so that we nobody can steal it

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,790
away from us for example but we do that

00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,250
in such a way that we can also were

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:47,840
liberal in the way that we allow people

00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,640
to use our brands in ways that will

00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,820
attract new users and especially

00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,840
contributors back to our projects so

00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,330
we're different from a traditional

00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,280
software vendor the typical other vendor

00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,960
would give you big slap on the wrist or

00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,730
a lawsuit if you use their brand and

00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,860
there are some ways that we are happy if

00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,819
you use our brand in the right way

00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,350
because

00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:08,329
it will bring us more contributors more

00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,309
contributors to our projects means more

00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:15,229
software or software means more public

00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:16,609
good that is our mission but the

00:11:15,229 --> 00:11:19,009
important thing that's perhaps not

00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:21,350
spelled out in policy it's fun Billy

00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:23,749
fundamentally what does Apache provide

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:26,209
we provide two things in terms of

00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:28,220
trademark law so topeak we provide

00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:31,339
software products that's our core

00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:34,100
mission so don't mess with us in terms

00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:37,189
of software product branding okay thank

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:41,179
you and secondarily we provide basic

00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:42,769
support services so when when a new user

00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:45,259
or a small company who doesn't have a

00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:47,239
budget or you know a developer who just

00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:48,649
wants to experiment they shouldn't have

00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:52,519
they need to be able to come to cloudy

00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:54,350
patchy org and just on this website they

00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:57,139
need to learn what it is how to download

00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:59,470
it how to configure it and have

00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:02,419
something doing a useful function all

00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,769
from the Apache site right now we're

00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:05,419
happy for vendors to have you know

00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:07,129
plugins or your magic install script you

00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:09,649
sell separately so and so forth but the

00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:11,600
core product from Apache has to be

00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:13,009
something useful for someone if somebody

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,779
wants to go you know spend extra money

00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:15,949
or inter partnership and get the rest of

00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:17,749
stuff that's great and we love that

00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:19,879
because that helps you know it's a

00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:21,889
symbiotic relationship but for people

00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:25,970
who don't they need two people to get

00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:27,559
everything from Apache and I don't know

00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,659
why it's in the body really should fix

00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:31,909
the slide but we do have a mix a of

00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:33,679
registered and common law trademarks so

00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:36,049
we ask everyone to respect all of them

00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,999
whether or not the registered we are

00:12:36,049 --> 00:12:41,329
working on a plan to register many more

00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:43,249
of our trademarks and cloudstack indeed

00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:46,999
thank you doe the previous sponsor is a

00:12:43,249 --> 00:12:48,979
registered trademark so I hear you say

00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:51,519
you know I've talked about what Apache

00:12:48,979 --> 00:12:53,629
believes and what we think and you know

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,339
why you should think about our stuff but

00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:57,679
what can you do I imagine your question

00:12:55,339 --> 00:13:00,829
is okay what's the real stuff I'm just

00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:04,489
interested in the details so how to use

00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:08,509
Apache project brands on software

00:13:04,489 --> 00:13:12,739
products we have an FAQ for this short I

00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:16,039
admit but so oh no send a console

00:13:12,739 --> 00:13:17,689
powered by Apache Steve patchy steve is

00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:18,130
a real project by the way you can go

00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:21,160
look it up

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:24,280
not very interesting but or the Yoyodyne

00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,590
accelerator for Apache CloudStack now

00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:29,170
when that does come out that is going to

00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:33,460
triple your performance efficiency on

00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:37,150
any cloud okay those are fine to do

00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:39,550
without permission the primary brand

00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:42,460
must be your own so the point here is

00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:44,800
that you have a primary brand it is

00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,420
powered by or it is for in case of a

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,680
plug-in people well understand that

00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,450
there's frameworks and their plugins and

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:54,130
plug-in comes to a different vendor from

00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:57,460
the framework your brand for our brand

00:13:54,130 --> 00:14:00,310
and then it's perfectly acceptable must

00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:04,630
use the full Apache foo form of the name

00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:06,640
so it must be for Apache CloudStack so

00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:08,980
that ensures that we get the credit back

00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,770
to our communities that we you know also

00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,570
include the Apache brand as part of this

00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:15,360
so in terms of logos logos are too hard

00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:18,520
to mash up that just doesn't work so

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,940
you're again your product logo must be

00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,320
your own logo now obviously on your

00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,490
download page you may say you know we do

00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,470
all this great stuff we're super fast

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,030
and we're also powered by Apache

00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,400
CloudStack you can have little blurb of

00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:31,750
pacha cloudstack is this logo there is

00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,820
fine because it's clear there's a

00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:37,060
separation but the primary brand must be

00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:41,440
yours so the the FAQ link is here which

00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:43,060
explains that so obviously this crowd I

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,070
imagine is very interested in services

00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:48,550
and hosting that's a lot of what clouds

00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:52,630
decades so again primary brand must be

00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:55,960
your own right use the full Apache food

00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:57,760
form of the name but here it's usually

00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,890
much clearer in the in the eyes of a

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,890
consumer you know the difference of your

00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:04,600
offering hosted solar right really fast

00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,950
host consoler people understand it's

00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,280
there's a software product that you're

00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:11,800
enabling or providing consulting for or

00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,900
whatever so I'm not as concerned about

00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,630
these kind of things both because

00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:19,150
they're usually clear to the end-user

00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:23,770
the separation as well as these are

00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:25,810
things that Apache does not provide so

00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:27,400
these are things that we relied I mean

00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:29,050
don't rely on but certainly appreciate

00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,070
companies that do provide this because

00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,439
then more people will use our software

00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:34,360
as well

00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:36,069
so don't imply exclusivity or

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,499
affiliation hopefully that's obvious

00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:40,269
with think of instead of thinking it as

00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:42,129
an apache trademark think of it as a

00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:44,759
Microsoft trademark that should probably

00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:47,410
solve most of those questions but and

00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:49,179
again the Apache project logo not as the

00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:51,610
primary branding but obviously it's

00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:56,259
acceptable in the home page as you know

00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:59,529
we're hosting this thing that's fine so

00:15:56,259 --> 00:16:01,319
what's the point why are we happy to

00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:04,629
allow some of this but we we need some

00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:08,529
rules on how you do this most

00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:10,989
importantly of how we want our brands

00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:13,899
used is to give credit back to the

00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:15,670
project community so we want users of

00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:17,739
your services and your hosting and your

00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:20,199
consulting in your training classes to

00:16:17,739 --> 00:16:22,839
understand that the Apache CloudStack or

00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:24,209
whatever Apache project underneath comes

00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:26,379
from an independent project community

00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:28,149
because the community gets credit to

00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:30,089
mean this is important for us for our

00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:32,799
committers and our new contributors and

00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:35,199
it's also important for us that's what

00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:37,029
the Apache brand means is that if

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,610
somebody is using your hosting and says

00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:41,290
hey I want to do solar my set my own

00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:43,449
when they look at solar they understand

00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:45,699
they can join the project too it's not

00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:47,980
your project it's an Apache project so

00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:53,049
that's why that's the essence of what we

00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:54,850
want to happen so events and swag I

00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:58,029
don't know if we need to even bother

00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:59,739
with this this slide because this is an

00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:02,879
exact this is an example of a great

00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:05,169
success in terms of cloudstack collab is

00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,480
following our guidelines has gotten

00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:10,600
approval is great you know great

00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,380
organization and running so events are

00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,049
different than a lot of other things

00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,490
because we're all used to going to trade

00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:17,169
shows and so on and we understand that

00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:19,299
there's the producer of the event and

00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:21,639
it's about this great product from

00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:23,889
somebody else and it has these great

00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:25,689
speakers who were companies so it's very

00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:28,299
clear to people the difference between

00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:30,820
the branding so here we would like you

00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:34,450
to use the FEU form so cloudstack collab

00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:36,700
conference right not the official

00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:39,100
product logo because that's not

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,049
appropriate in the event brand but

00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,220
obviously the homepage can say we're

00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:44,870
having a conference about apache

00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:48,140
cloudstack and that can talk about

00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:50,470
as the product that's appropriate the

00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:52,880
key part of our event policy is

00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:55,550
including educational content for the

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,830
underlying Apache project so somebody

00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,670
should be able to attend your event

00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,660
whether you're charging you know

00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:02,630
thousand dollars or whether you're

00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:04,130
having a bar camp and learn how some of

00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:06,760
the content must be about apache

00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:11,660
cloudstack downloaded from our project

00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:14,270
so we have a note that PMC members great

00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,230
pmc here by the way PMC members must be

00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:17,150
allowed to be on your selection

00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,650
committee if you have one so that's our

00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,390
check and balance to ensure that some of

00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:22,730
the content will be relevant to a user

00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:24,020
who you know might be interesting your

00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,360
services but might not they might just

00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,620
want the free version from us obviously

00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,910
a lot of the content can be about your

00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,500
thing because you're doing the event we

00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:33,830
understand that but some of it needs to

00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:36,290
be about the core Apache project and we

00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:38,750
are working on making it much easier a

00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:40,940
way that we can protect our brands but

00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,740
make it much easier for you to then do

00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,780
swagg give away t-shirts and so on so

00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,830
not just a conference t-shirt but it'll

00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,630
give aways and so on that you could

00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:51,440
bring to other events we're working on

00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:53,600
making that a lot easier so these are

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,679
all specific policies that are written

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,130
up and I'm happy to answer questions

00:18:54,679 --> 00:19:02,600
with specific examples what are some

00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:04,220
ways that are appropriate what are some

00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,110
of the messaging that is appropriate or

00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,140
perhaps rather I'm just gonna say the

00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:12,710
messaging that is not appropriate when

00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:15,860
using apache brand in your materials so

00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:18,170
don't imply ownership or control because

00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:20,390
that goes against Apache projects being

00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:22,460
independent that's the worst thing is we

00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:24,920
don't want you know people to think that

00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:27,890
the donor of Apache CloudStack still

00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:30,590
runs the project they don't and that's

00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:32,870
important to all of our brands no

00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:35,080
superlatives because again that implies

00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:38,230
you're the only one who can do something

00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:41,630
no corporate affiliation so people

00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:44,390
committers interacting projects as

00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:46,610
individuals not from our perspective as

00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:51,100
representatives representatives of your

00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:53,210
corporation so you know there is no

00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,370
company affiliation with any of our

00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:58,419
projects that just does not exist we

00:19:55,370 --> 00:20:00,759
don't have that structure and some like

00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:01,989
is not here necessarily have had you

00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:03,580
know marketing campaigns maybe not on

00:20:01,989 --> 00:20:05,470
the website but an email blast and you

00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,419
know very obvious places saying you know

00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:10,379
we employ eighty percent of the PMC

00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:12,940
members for such and such project no

00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:17,950
again not very friendly the community

00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:20,049
not very friendly to the asf as all and

00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:23,379
the reasons for those are we are vendor

00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:27,519
neutral and the apache brand means our

00:20:23,379 --> 00:20:29,739
projects are independently run so how

00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:32,109
else can you show support how else can

00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:35,609
you besides just doing your own branding

00:20:32,109 --> 00:20:38,590
involving ours help out with projects so

00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:42,549
code and engineers obviously inputting

00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:44,080
project non coders and so on which this

00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:45,659
community is doing a great job with it's

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,309
really impressive how that works

00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:50,109
supporting speakers at events so well

00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:51,789
there a lot of cases where you know a

00:20:50,109 --> 00:20:53,679
great speaker who works for some big co

00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:55,139
wants to go to the event and the big co

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,970
says you know it's not much how about it

00:20:55,139 --> 00:21:00,190
you know if you can see the way to help

00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,590
that speaker get there that increases

00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:04,600
visibility for everybody and it's

00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,669
helpful and sponsoring the SF again

00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,619
thank you sponsors and oh yeah help out

00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:10,359
on marketing at cod stack that's a great

00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:12,279
example of how to do it because that's

00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:16,779
the PMC is looting leaving a project and

00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:18,639
welcoming you into that so the dark

00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:20,499
elephant in the room not the yellow

00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:24,190
yellow elephant but the dark elephant in

00:21:20,499 --> 00:21:26,139
the room is Apache brand enforcement so

00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:28,570
I will be very brief because I hope it

00:21:26,139 --> 00:21:33,190
will not come up but if it does come up

00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:35,799
we will enforce our brands so not in any

00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:38,769
particular order we can take legal

00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:40,749
action obviously our pro bono counsel

00:21:38,769 --> 00:21:43,179
for trademark and brand issues is dla

00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:45,989
piper which is a worldwide a global

00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:48,369
leading IP intellectual property firm

00:21:45,989 --> 00:21:50,289
and they are happy to help us and they

00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:52,450
have helped a lot with setting our

00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:54,759
policies and so on social pressure

00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,619
pressure and press so obviously if you

00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:58,059
are interested in participating in the

00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:59,769
community if you want to change the

00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:02,350
direction if the rest of the community

00:21:59,769 --> 00:22:04,779
sees you being the bad actor and we make

00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:06,700
it known they're not going to listen to

00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:11,280
you either in the marketplace or in the

00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:13,440
project lists and for cases where

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,080
I understand that brand enforcement is

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,880
often a process of negotiation I say

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,470
negotiation I don't mean negotiating to

00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,320
allow you to do something I wouldn't

00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:24,480
otherwise but discussing the issue in

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,580
seeing the both sides of the story and

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,160
explaining why it is important to

00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:32,430
respect our brands when that doesn't

00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:34,800
work then I'm also happy to send a note

00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:36,630
to the board and ask them to vote to

00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,520
remove any employees of your corporation

00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:40,560
from the PMC of the relevant project

00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:43,440
because the corporation cannot respect

00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,870
our brands then as a non-profit we have

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,610
there's no reason for us to allow them

00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:50,370
to participate in that projects

00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:54,300
governance that's just inappropriate but

00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:56,430
don't let it get there ask first which I

00:22:54,300 --> 00:23:00,090
think in this community will go a long

00:22:56,430 --> 00:23:01,740
way so I just want to I want to stay in

00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:04,040
stand the wave lunch if everybody who's

00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:07,620
hungry so thank you and resources so

00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:11,940
when we say community / code that's how

00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:14,400
we live that's how we function so I want

00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:16,560
to say thank you to all the Apache

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,360
members who over the past 15 years have

00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,720
built the foundation that allows us to

00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,130
happen that have modeled the way thank

00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,570
you to all the Apache committers and pmc

00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:26,490
members many of whom were here at the

00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,410
conference because you are actually

00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,580
accomplishing our mission I'm not

00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:31,980
accomplishing the mission of giving my

00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:34,290
software I don't even check in to

00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,610
batching stuff anymore you are all doing

00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:38,940
the mission of the public good with

00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:41,040
software which we really appreciate on

00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,390
trademarks at apache doorway I have a

00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,790
trademark squiddy that helps advise me

00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:46,230
on trademark matters and big thanks to

00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,580
them and a special thanks to David nalli

00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:50,240
so where they are in the back of the

00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:53,370
room not even blushing that much anymore

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,250
who has really helped out and thanks to

00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:58,740
our counsel at DLA Piper mark radcliffe

00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:01,860
is a leading trademark attorney who sets

00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:03,450
up a number of other open-source think

00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:06,930
tanks and so on which I'm still you know

00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:08,700
trying to get my own invite to and here

00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:11,130
for everyone here thank you for

00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,750
respecting Apache brands and that goes

00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:15,120
double e for people in this room because

00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,830
Apache CloudStack has been one of the I

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,660
think one of the great models of how

00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,580
this can be a success both from the

00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,750
obvious perspective of the kind of

00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,750
software it is and the kinds of things

00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:26,340
that you do his businesses but also how

00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,530
well the PMC has managed this how well

00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:30,870
duh businesses have respected Iran's and

00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:33,300
have tried to collaborate to really make

00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:37,500
a better model outfit so we very much

00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:39,390
appreciate that and I have a few carry

00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,250
back resources that the policies are all

00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:43,020
posted on the web page there there are a

00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:45,960
couple of them are down a link or 2 i'd

00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:48,480
like to improve that but requires having

00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,880
time one thing that might be useful for

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,670
the y yr policies are written this way

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:57,390
is the last link there the project

00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:59,730
independence is required for PMC's so i

00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,380
tried to ride in an essay format i can

00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:04,350
define how we have to have the web page

00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:06,600
show your brand that's not that hard but

00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:09,780
the idea that a project needs to present

00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,790
an independent view of their governance

00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:13,700
that's critical for all our projects and

00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:16,320
that is required of all of our projects

00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:19,950
so that's an important thing perhaps for

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:22,080
your directors of marketing to say hey

00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:24,080
you need to read this this explains why

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,390
I'm telling you to follow that guideline

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:30,300
because that is fundamentally what

00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:32,610
that's the why of how we operate and if

00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,200
there are any questions then this is one

00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:36,990
case where we're happy to take questions

00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,690
in private now normally we always say go

00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:42,240
to the public list but in brand

00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:44,550
questions or go to market list obviously

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,680
brand questions we are happy if you feel

00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:49,080
the need to ask us in private on the

00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:51,360
private pmc list or trademarks at apache

00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,710
which is a privately archive list so we

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,510
understand you know you might want to

00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:57,510
launch some new campaign you want to say

00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:58,590
hey you know will this be okay and you

00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,210
don't want to then public because you're

00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:03,840
announcing attentions if I say no

00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:05,840
everybody is marist if you do do that

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,700
give us plenty of time to respond

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:11,700
because I'm here as a volunteer on

00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:14,040
vacation and all the rest of us who set

00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:16,260
policy and so on do it as volunteer work

00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,970
because we believe in the foundation so

00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:22,890
we need plenty of time to respond to

00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:25,110
things so and I have exactly one minute

00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:26,790

00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:29,460
