Title: Troubleshooting the Virtual Router - Run and Get Diagnostics
Publication date: 2019-09-20
Playlist: ApacheCon 2019, Cloudstack Collaboration Conference
Description: 
	Demonstration of CloudStack’s latest features for troubleshooting the Virtual Router connectivity and configuration, called Run and Get Diagnostics. Run Diagnostics gives the admin ability to execute diagnostics commands native the VR OS directly from the CloudStack UI. Admin is able to determine connectivity capabilities of the VR without logging into the SystemVM at all. Get diagnostics feature allow the admin to gather information about the SystemVM as fast as clicking on a button in the ‘QuickView’ of the VM. Admin can also execute custom scripts on each SystemVM type from the CloudStack UI. This session will begin with complete presentation of the features followed by live demo and Q&A.

let's get started we go to the camera

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:21,369
alright so yeah first oh yeah about me I

00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,560
just breaking off in here so I am

00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:26,560
software engineering test so basically I

00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:30,609
get paid to break stuff which is awesome

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,400
I got the lab experience in the area I

00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:36,340
specialize in test automation test

00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:39,100
frameworks and whatnot I joined shaping

00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:43,510
crosstalk into 2016 and I've been

00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:48,760
recently appointed to join the PMC which

00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:51,250
is great and today I'm going to be

00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,609
talking you a bit about troubleshooting

00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:58,109
the virtual router and what do we do

00:00:54,609 --> 00:01:01,300
when things get messy

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,820
so the virtual router is essential for

00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,220
card stock and for the network model we

00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,860
have a real great networking model that

00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:11,020
it's multi-tenant you can facilitate

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,630
shared networks isolated networks VP

00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:17,350
scenes whatnot and whatnot and you can

00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:19,210
run various network services in it and

00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:22,170
most of the people use the virtual

00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:28,500
router to facilitate this services like

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:31,119
DHCP started not follow and whatnot and

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,619
the virtual router is really really

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,259
great the three through it's working

00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:38,729
fine and it's it's it's really easy to

00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:42,310
model and to configure you have this

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:45,250
like UI designer of networks that you

00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:49,390
specify everything in the UI and it gets

00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:53,920
gets provisioned into the VR which is

00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:56,020
great but the issues are it starts to

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,880
get funny when when it starts not to be

00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,950
working and you start to ask yourself

00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:04,600
what's wrong with it and how do we fix

00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:07,299
it so here we got some new features that

00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:11,110
are really really neat and it really

00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:13,960
makes your life easier and to get

00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:16,630
yourself around around what's what's

00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:20,110
happening this first of all the first

00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:22,960
one is get Diagnostics so with this one

00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:26,320
you're basically able to to fetch data

00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:29,080
from the virtual from the VR so meaning

00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,480
you can get config files you can get log

00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,520
files and you can get everything that

00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,060
you basically need to figure out what's

00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,790
what's basically happening in your VR is

00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,830
it the DHCP not configured properly

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,780
are you missing some IP so configuration

00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:48,640
did you did something funny with the IP

00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:51,190
ranges or whatever so with this feature

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,990
you can directly form a cloud stack

00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:59,530
console you can directly call the API

00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:01,630
and it will go to the VR it will gather

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,900
all the all the files that you needs

00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:08,860
like the log files or the the IP tables

00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:11,290
or the the network controller

00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:15,720
configuration it will buckle it up in

00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:18,130
our hive and to end it and then it will

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,910
post them back on the secondary storage

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:25,660
which from where you can download them

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:29,350
locally so let's talk about some of the

00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:33,400
phots and some files that you can get by

00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:38,460
default by calling the API so with with

00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:42,220
routers you get IP tables I've config

00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:45,190
route and these are a bit than some

00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,480
basic Linux commands that gives you an

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,230
idea what's what's your current

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,550
configuration

00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:55,090
other than that you can get some various

00:03:50,550 --> 00:04:01,230
config files like the DNS mask cloud

00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:05,740
that lock and what not or not and with

00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:10,690
enter with the system VMs you get almost

00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:14,260
the same the same set of files simply

00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:18,759
without the the network services relates

00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:22,720
to on this feature is hyper hyper visor

00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:25,000
agnostic so it runs from on kvam on zen

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,820
on on VMware it doesn't really matter

00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,510
what your heart visor is as long as you

00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:33,760
have your second of storage VM up and

00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:38,550
running to do the file transferring you

00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,550
can you can simply use it it's easy

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,450
so other than files you can also other

00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,460
than the defaults that you that that we

00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,740
just discussed you can get some custom

00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,860
files from from the VR like for example

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,920
if you have if you are running some your

00:04:53,860 --> 00:05:01,750
private version of the template and you

00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:05,490
want to get some some specific file that

00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:08,470
that is important you can you can simply

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:11,260
type in the absolute path of the file

00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:13,780
within the API it will get it back to

00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:16,660
here and you get displayed with it I'll

00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:19,630
show up a bit later in an in a demo and

00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,730
you can also run script run some custom

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,700
scripts that you've prepared for your at

00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:27,570
your virtual router it's just only that

00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:30,160
you need to specify them in brackets and

00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:36,460
you need to place them in that specific

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:42,750
directory sorry let's go through some

00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:45,310
settings about about the feature so

00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:48,010
first off is some garbage collection

00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:50,440
because you are basically when you when

00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,990
you request these files you store them

00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:56,410
on the secondary storage and at some

00:05:52,990 --> 00:06:00,120
point you might get a little bit crowded

00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:05,169
and you might start to run out of space

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:07,750
if that's a lot of files so then you you

00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:14,560
probably need to enable the garbage

00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:17,200
collection which would which would which

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,669
would circulate and pick up files that

00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:26,080
have been identified to be cleaned and

00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:28,180
you just you just keep get house key

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,280
housekeeping of your storage and you

00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,620
you're not gonna run out of space for

00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,810
example so then the next one is the

00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,460
interval that your job is going to run

00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:41,320
so by default this is

00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:43,150
this is one hour so every one hour it

00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:50,699
will go and check for such files and it

00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:53,710
will simply remove them and the

00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,930
Diagnostics data retrieval timeout is

00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:59,889
the when you basically execute a command

00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:01,810
the API if you run a script or execute a

00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:04,030
particular command that may take a lot

00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:07,180
of time you can define a specific time

00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:09,940
out that to basically fail the call if

00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:14,650
it takes too much time considering

00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:17,260
something went wrong with it so in the

00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:19,870
the the next file the next configuration

00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:22,020
is actually where you define what files

00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:27,250
you should be looking forward to delete

00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:30,550
like in terms of H and this one I think

00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:33,280
is one day if I'm not mistaking that's

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:36,010
in seconds so that will go every hour

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,139
with this set of settings basically it

00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,789
will go every hour looking for files

00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:42,520
that are bigger than one day that are

00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:45,510
older than one day and it will simply

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,889
delete them and the last one is

00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:49,780
threshold that will basically disable

00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:51,880
the feature if you are running out of

00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,200
space on your secondary storage so for

00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,979
example if your secondary storage is

00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,720
more than 90% occupied it will simply

00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:06,310
disable the feature what you we won't be

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:08,620
able to to use it you some more info

00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:11,260
about get Diagnostics that has been much

00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,510
with this particular PR number and it's

00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:19,810
currently available in the latest their

00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:22,590
chests and 4/12 I think and there's a

00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:26,740
wiki I'm gonna share that slides later

00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:30,510
you guys you can basically have a browse

00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:37,260
and see see some further details with it

00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:37,260
there are a few limitations put it so

00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:42,699
so basically in order to work as I

00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,649
mentioned you need to if you want to get

00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:46,810
a specific file you need to you can't

00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:49,329
just type the file name that won't work

00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:51,490
you need to explicitly specify the full

00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:54,970
path to the file it will go and get it

00:08:51,490 --> 00:09:00,250
simply you absolutely need to running

00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:04,480
and online SS VM like the secondary

00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:06,610
storage VM to be able to proceed and get

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,589
the foul and get it move to the

00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:13,029
secondary stores so you can simply

00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:15,730
download it from there you should be of

00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:18,519
course you should have a second storage

00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:23,110
pool available at by default by less

00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:29,019
than 90 percent occupied this feature

00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:30,759
from now just support system VMs so you

00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:35,110
can't really use it against your user

00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:38,500
VMs it's you can use it against console

00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:45,910
proxy against second source VM or any

00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:47,680
routers yeah as I just mentioned the any

00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,420
script if you would like to execute like

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:55,180
if you have a custom script that will go

00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:57,430
and reset all your Knicks or restart any

00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:03,329
services locally that needs to be in

00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:07,029
that specific place of cloud /bin and

00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:09,639
the response the the actual response of

00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:11,920
the API is not the file but it's just a

00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:16,480
new URL that you can simply go and

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,980
download the file form coupe so I'm

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,649
gonna pause this for now

00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:26,879
and I'm gonna show it to you guys right

00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:26,879
away so here I have my environment okay

00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:34,770
well you just log into it in my

00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,410
environment I have a simple network that

00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,340
is isolated Network I have some VMs

00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:42,090
running in it

00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:46,620
that's not important for now we go to

00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:49,620
the virtual router of it and by simply

00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:52,350
extending this option we we can we see

00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,750
that we have this option get diagnosis

00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,910
data and we when we click on it we get

00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,910
this dialog window where we can specify

00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:03,030
a specific file that we want to download

00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:05,220
or we can leave it blank it will fall

00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:09,720
back to the defaults with all that

00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:13,920
configs and log files and whatnot into a

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:16,350
buckling up in an archive and so it

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,540
takes a couple of seconds to execute and

00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:23,100
we are we have been given with this zip

00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:26,610
file to download and which we if we

00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:29,990
actually open we see all these sort of

00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:36,200
files that are defined in the in the

00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:40,560
conflicts in the global settings sorry

00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:42,720
and Yahoo can have a have a look at the

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,870
cloud that lock for example and it has

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,140
all the latest info in it and do

00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:53,340
whatever you like to diagnose determined

00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:57,120
and you simply wouldn't have to SSH into

00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:59,520
the VR and look for all these files that

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,430
you previously spend like 30 minutes on

00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:09,390
the internet having to find them where

00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:14,670
where the exactly--i are sitting let's

00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:19,730
try that custom file so if we have let's

00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:19,730
say some file in inside the VR

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:33,860
log into it so let's say that we need to

00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:50,790
get a specific file let's go at CCC

00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:55,770
let's say and we know that this file is

00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:56,460
located that route slash CCC and if we

00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:02,000
go now

00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:08,010
in in the UI and say get me through it

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:10,080
not CCC it will skip the default ransom

00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:16,500
to go searching for that single file

00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:20,790
only and you get the same our hive with

00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:28,950
our CCC file which has the polyfill of

00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:34,080
we after so that's let's get Diagnostics

00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:40,710
and you like we can proceed with the the

00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:43,170
next one which is run Diagnostics so run

00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:47,310
Diagnostics is the feature that enables

00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:50,820
you to run some network didn't some

00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:55,140
native UNIX networking commands that

00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:58,920
would basically tell you what your

00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:03,990
connectivity status and what if you're

00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:05,340
able to reach a destination or are you

00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:10,380
are you connected to the Internet

00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:12,990
basically these commands are so yeah you

00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:18,600
can use it on all the system VM types

00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:22,890
like VRS VMC's console proxy VM and it

00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:26,730
supports the pink obviously I think most

00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:28,560
commonly used commands so you can ping a

00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:31,560
destination either inside or outside

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,800
your cloud to determine if if you have

00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,930
connectivity from LA via VR or

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:42,019
Stephen to your to your custom

00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:44,339
destination if if that's still not

00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:48,000
making much sense for your

00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:51,630
troubleshooting you can use our ping I'm

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,820
sorry you can use our pink and specify

00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:57,089
for example a custom Nick that you would

00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:59,190
like to go through your ping to go

00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:02,579
through a custom Nick and be more

00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:06,029
specific and the last one is trace roads

00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:07,350
so you can basically see how many cops

00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:10,350
you have until you reach your

00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:14,010
destination get displayed of the delays

00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:18,990
and in figure out what's what what could

00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:25,860
be wrong at at reaching out your

00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:30,290
destination so again this feature is -

00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:33,839
Gnostic so as long as you are your

00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:38,070
system VM is running you can use it so

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:40,740
long as you're it's it can be contacted

00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:43,470
you can you can simply use it it runs

00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:48,360
for secondary source console policy and

00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:55,820
and virtual routers the PR got merged in

00:15:48,360 --> 00:16:00,420
4.12 and it's it's it's rate to be used

00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:03,540
some photo documentation about it like

00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:06,680
design feature spec if you want to go

00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:11,459
with with some deep details in it and

00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:13,680
I've recently wrote a blog about these

00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:16,590
two features you can also check it out

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:20,100
and see some further details

00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:25,260
about it and let me let me quickly show

00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:30,270
you this feature as well if we go to the

00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:32,610
same VR that we have there's the the

00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:37,680
icon that we can just simply call the

00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:39,540
API here we have the three options but

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:44,029
we are available Pinterest route and our

00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:46,529
pink and for example we can say take

00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:52,050
google.com and let's say we're gonna

00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:54,150
ping it and four times and right now

00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:56,160
it's logging into that particular VR

00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:58,770
it's executing the command that is gonna

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,779
give back there in the response to us

00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:03,380
it's not the prettiest response right

00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:07,050
now but it's still you can you can get

00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:11,569
you can get the idea of how your trace

00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:11,569
abilities is is is doing

00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:27,549
right some credits this feature has

00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:31,250
mainly been worked by from Dingaan a

00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:35,149
Hoku Rohit Yadav which is sitting right

00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:36,919
there and the shape dev team there's

00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:38,620
also a lot of people from community

00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:42,049
being involved with these features that

00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:46,870
have been in in in further testing in

00:17:42,049 --> 00:18:00,970
reviewing and various discussions and

00:17:46,870 --> 00:18:00,970
yeah you have questions all right

00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:19,940
oh yeah you can grab any file you just

00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:20,420
simply specify the file path and you can

00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,500
get it

00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:27,830
well the limitation goes by if your

00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:31,580
storage isn't like more than ninety

00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:33,440
percent occupied and if it if it if it

00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,059
is it's simply gonna disable the feature

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,840
you're not going to be able to run it

00:18:35,059 --> 00:19:11,720
but if it's still enough space you'll be

00:18:38,840 --> 00:19:15,050
able to get the file yes yeah you can

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:18,350
you can also specify you can also run

00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:20,000
actually commands like you can pass the

00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:24,050
arguments and run the commands written

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:33,250
in brackets and from to the output of

00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:33,250
the run Diagnostics

00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:45,410
just let him get back to so run

00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:49,490
Diagnostics is not yet been March I

00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:52,460
think it it has been submitted against

00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:54,830
for thirteen but it's still on the

00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:58,460
testing and on the verification and it's

00:19:54,830 --> 00:20:00,290
it was about it was directed for photons

00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,300
in but unfortunately we can manage to

00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:05,540
get it there and we're looking forward

00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:10,840
to get much in the next in probably in

00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:10,840
winter out yes but no promises

00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,510
I just want to show you this slide

00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:40,630
any other questions guys oh yeah you can

00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:44,230
have a script yeah you can have a script

00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:49,000
get it on the VR put it in that flash

00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:51,880
opt / clouds /bin directory and you can

00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,399
simply call the API with that with

00:20:51,880 --> 00:21:18,250
brackets and the script name a to

00:20:54,399 --> 00:21:36,970
execute and get back the result or you

00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:38,679
get the response yeah oh you get the

00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:42,519
output of the command that you execute

00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:44,350
so you get you if you're executing a

00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:46,570
script you get the output of the script

00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:52,659
if that's listing who your connections

00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:54,279
you're gonna see it yeah it will be

00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:57,580
downloadable it's just how it works

00:21:54,279 --> 00:22:00,070
because that's one way of using it but

00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:02,830
if you want to get the log files you can

00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:06,149
see that's gonna be bigger so you're

00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:06,149
gonna need a downloadable file

00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:22,870
two times the space it will only live on

00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,730
the secondary storage and as long as

00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:41,400
your secondary storage is not fully

00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:41,400
occupied like less than ninety yeah

00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,989
[Music]

00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,230

or questions whoever gets to ask many

00:23:53,950 --> 00:24:05,830
questions
