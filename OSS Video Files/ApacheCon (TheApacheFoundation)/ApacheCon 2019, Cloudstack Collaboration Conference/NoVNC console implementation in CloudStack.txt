Title: NoVNC console implementation in CloudStack
Publication date: 2019-09-20
Playlist: ApacheCon 2019, Cloudstack Collaboration Conference
Description: 
	NoVNC is an open-source browser based VNC client, implemented using HTML5 technologies (Web Sockets, Canvas) with encryption (wss://) support. Proposed NoVNC implementation provides better performance and is more responsive when compared to the current ajax-based console in Apache CloudStack. Our implementation is based on NoVNC and websockify. Websockify is a websocket proxy converting WebSocket request from browser to TCP request and then forward it to VNC server. We have already implemented a NoVNC console for CloudStack 4.13. This new console is smooth and very stable. It can be accessed by multiple sessions at the same time and easily integrated into other platforms. During this talk we will demonstrate how NoVNC console is implemented in CloudStack and how VNC password authentication is implemented in NoVNC and websockify.

good morning everyone we're talked my

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,259
job as my talk today I'll talk talk

00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:16,660
about our competition of new console for

00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:20,980
watch machines in plastic

00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:25,000
my name is away Joe I'm currently

00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:28,029
working in his web in Netherland and I

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,359
joined you so having 2012 before that I

00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:36,820
worked manager of project based on a

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:41,379
phenomena between for two years and in

00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:46,360
2013 I contributed for seven companies -

00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:51,430
caustic photo - I'm coming commuters in

00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:56,789
2013 and number of PMC see in 2017 you

00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:56,789
can reach me by my work meal or my gmail

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:06,340
out of work I'm a father of two

00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:07,180
daughters our team caustic team and this

00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,690
way

00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:14,140
have developers and engineers from eight

00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:17,890
countries we have office in understand

00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:20,920
and filling see us and the pan glowing

00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:24,490
India we are building maintenance

00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:28,599
supporting our cloud pop cloud and cloud

00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:33,569
stack private cloud in Israel since 2012

00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:33,569
and we started with cloud tech two to 14

00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:40,840
we are running over thousand physical

00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:46,509
servers 16 the Centers in Netherlands

00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:50,890
Germany UK US and the Singapore we have

00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:54,459
around 3000 kameez to close tech and we

00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:57,940
have money money in customized changes

00:01:54,459 --> 00:02:00,910
so we are putting our changes to class

00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:05,850
mystery and we work creates more

00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:10,330
progress to culture ministry

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:14,459
so my our start with discussion how to

00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:20,110
access machines like we didn't see and

00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:24,069
if function of current console of voting

00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:27,040
machines in cloud stack then I would use

00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:34,750
our ideas and implementation our

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:37,390
improvement in the essence demo most of

00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:40,569
us should be familiar with this one this

00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:46,870
is current solution for in cloud stack

00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:54,269
and this is the no BS icon so our I'm

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:58,810
going to present access which machines

00:02:54,269 --> 00:03:01,450
normally when we plot instance the first

00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:04,870
thing we normally do is trying to access

00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:08,709
the instance so for the needed servers

00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:12,430
we use King use SSH and therefore

00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:18,329
Windows servers we use RTP all this

00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:22,090
weighs depends on something that the VM

00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:24,900
has that Oakridge so what if the VM

00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:30,070
doesn't have an F collection for example

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:33,970
disk is broken or open system is broken

00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:36,160
IP is not contact IP is wrong we haven't

00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:41,380
used perfect at ease we cannot collect

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:44,799
to it Stephanie for physical servers we

00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:48,430
can access to a console of virtue of the

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:51,459
servers by is console web console

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:54,340
vendors provide service the terror

00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:59,319
server we use I track HP we use I know

00:03:54,340 --> 00:04:04,410
so this is there a way to remotely

00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:09,810
control what machine like we do

00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:15,150
the fixers the answer is the Vincey so

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:19,260
Vincey is a use standardized

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:24,230
standardized protocol named happy to

00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:27,000
emote any access server it can handle

00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:31,020
trust me it's the keyboard event also

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,180
the mouse events so we can remotely

00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:37,170
control the server it was designed to

00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:39,860
access a server but for now is also

00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:47,220
supported by most popular hypervisors

00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:49,160
for example KBM VMware server example

00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,830
how to access

00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:57,300
console virtual machines running and

00:04:52,830 --> 00:05:00,960
Kenya so only start we have in call

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:04,380
stack if we look at the fvg fellow of

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:09,290
the VM we can fund this fact the means

00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:12,300
it were provides a business's server

00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:16,590
listening on the IP of the hypervisor

00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:19,230
and the court is called Auto elevated

00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:28,260
and password is really password to

00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:32,160
access the very see so now we work with

00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:35,850
its play it which we work at this result

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:40,440
the Pope IP of the hypervisor and the

00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:44,220
number the actual port of the wheel we

00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:47,040
build in support of the VM is five nine

00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:50,160
zero plus number in this in this is is

00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:55,280
five nine zero nine so now we are able

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,280
to access the VM an IP and the port

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,779
there are money will decline you can use

00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,610
to access the console of the wish

00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:06,279
machine

00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:12,219
let's the example we use a given C we

00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:14,589
include IP and courtly collect we ask

00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:16,930
for the various passwords then we pull

00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:20,849
the password because in the DVD player

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,849
and guess so

00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:30,340
for the dis servers and the VMware we

00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:33,070
have the similar configuration and also

00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:43,440
can catch the actual port by some

00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:49,510
commands command on 14th server command

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:54,580
when we're so meet which is first it

00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:55,419
requires VNC client application and a

00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,139
second

00:06:55,419 --> 00:07:02,470
it requires the direct access to the

00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:05,200
hypervisor so he means it's hyper cars

00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:10,060
that have private IP we cannot cry to

00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:17,770
the VM we cannot collect to the private

00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:19,870
IP out of hyperbolas so the question

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:23,460
here how to access a virtual machine

00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:28,180
from closed I web interface we have the

00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:33,130
vintage server which means the VNC the

00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:37,960
Wii console of the washing machines on

00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:40,380
the hypervisor the hypervisor use IP and

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,380
we have

00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:56,070
what cut cheese browser session of Casa

00:07:45,870 --> 00:08:00,000
UI so first try to web server and we

00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:05,060
need something here

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,229
it means form circuits in HP pressed but

00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,870
to access the valency server

00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:15,240
it requires kitty parish so we need

00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:20,610
approximately which can act as bridge of

00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:26,300
HV press and anticipation this also acts

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:33,000
as the bridge of the public Internet

00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:39,479
Pemex network just current solution

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:42,810
classic this council but it's good it's

00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:46,620
a provide a way to remotely access the

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:49,950
verge machine and it can also handle the

00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:54,290
keyboard event and also the most of it

00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:57,800
and it's run clear sometimes is nagging

00:08:54,290 --> 00:09:00,870
especially for some windows systems and

00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:05,580
it's fourth all in one session so if we

00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:10,310
open the console from a snap pop and the

00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:14,220
we when we open the console same is this

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:20,420
cloud server then the conversation this

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:24,350
in a pub way we kick off so why snake

00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:27,950
so between look at the network like the

00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:33,530
each browser you can see that the

00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:40,460
request send from browser to server two

00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:44,030
or three times every second its course

00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:47,540
by the design of the web console

00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:50,890
encaustic in hostak we have control

00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:55,790
proxy p.m. which provides this counsel

00:09:50,890 --> 00:10:00,140
its use as accessibility viewer as web

00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:03,710
server and also all the paper events and

00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:09,380
mouse events handled by cloud service in

00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:13,250
the comes across India and from the we

00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:19,760
access the console from browser it's in

00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:23,060
the quest used polling this framework

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,900
was designed around eight years old and

00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:34,340
at that time autocracy is very popular

00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:37,340
so it's the little social and now we're

00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:41,890
wondering if we can use some other

00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,890
technology to replace all

00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:55,070
all income and the answer is WebSocket

00:10:50,690 --> 00:11:00,240
what is WebSocket WebSockets is a

00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:05,970
standardized protocol is used for

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:08,579
browser-based application to create true

00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:13,230
economic vision between the browser and

00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:17,880
the web browser so this is exactly what

00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:22,519
we need for now it's supported by most

00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,519
modern browsers and the mobile brothers

00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:37,170
I woke you a shot example how WebSocket

00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:41,040
is working code we have client home on

00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:48,420
your browser the server reckoned and the

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:54,410
server as this boat it will display all

00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:57,930
the updates of a sparrow to browser this

00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:02,660
Stevenage you here this is the command

00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:08,339
only we used to catch needs updates from

00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:13,110
users and now we open the console of the

00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:17,680
of our browser and we create a web

00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:23,650
server packaging to the server

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:30,580
now I stretch and we send family we

00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:34,650
would like to get update and WebSocket

00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:40,750
server we extend what update to abroad

00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:44,440
few seconds some new update and more so

00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:49,300
to re dispirit the WebSocket kind our

00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:52,089
browser do not need to send your path to

00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:59,200
the server the server will pro activists

00:12:52,089 --> 00:13:00,460
and updates between our browser how to

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,390
access the server

00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:10,210
you also get we need works or the proxy

00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:14,290
here we need to say the road will send

00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:17,230
request to a web server and web server

00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:22,560
will send some response to our browser

00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:28,680
and this next our browser will create

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,680
web so catchy socket pro see

00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,460
so

00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:39,610
and next the website party will start

00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:42,700
the veins a handshake to our business

00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:45,460
server then there are some updates with

00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:55,770
the radius server then get your product

00:13:45,460 --> 00:14:03,970
Pro activity sent back to our browser in

00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:06,730
2017 Sachin has implemented louisa

00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:12,100
console in his google Summer of Code

00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:16,240
project if you use the new Vincey of the

00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:22,660
front content and in cloud service and

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:25,180
use JT aqua server what is it no B and C

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:29,410
no being say is a web-based way the

00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:32,830
client is mostly written in JavaScript

00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:36,300
and it's a very popular and used by many

00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:39,790
projects including some our competitors

00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:45,490
for example OpenStack open nebula each

00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:49,420
ocean and each use web sockets in stuff

00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:55,270
can use coding and more than that we

00:14:49,420 --> 00:15:01,710
provide better UI using a KML file let's

00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:07,050
see the screenshot of no no easy console

00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:07,050
in Google some code once empty and

00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:19,990
the drawback of this solution it's a

00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:23,980
nice extra parameter in plastic over

00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:27,640
your UI and the coach not completely

00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:36,510
tested and proved sorry in our testing

00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:36,510
is also not stable if we look at design

00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:50,380
some research we found it might be

00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:54,370
caused by the teach web server and also

00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:57,370
the classics because keyboard event and

00:15:54,370 --> 00:16:01,899
the motive still be processed either

00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:05,010
close service same was our concurrent

00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:09,880
whistle so we are thinking if we can

00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:14,680
maybe use some other project or some

00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:21,100
other product to replace the kikiwaka

00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:23,399
server and at the end we use a WebSocket

00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,399
bye

00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:31,529
WebSocket is also open source project it

00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:34,660
was part of the nobility project and

00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:39,850
nice standalone project is written in

00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:45,700
Python it's also used by our competitors

00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:49,630
OpenStack of in Lebanon and is a web

00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:53,860
sort proxy it can transfer translates

00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:58,240
the WebSocket traffic between the our

00:16:53,860 --> 00:17:01,450
browser to the WebSocket server to the

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:09,370
normal traffic back end to the seven

00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:13,920
back end and it also supports encrypted

00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:13,920
web socket question over yes

00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:20,020
here is a shot example how low Vincey

00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:25,030
and the WebSockets

00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:30,330
works first step no Levin see from

00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:34,000
github and then as ethical rules and

00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:36,940
then start web scheduler this one is

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:43,350
small wet download web so p5 from github

00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:49,179
and then start listening the port port

00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:53,860
8680 and the traffic to local for 680

00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:58,050
will be forwarded to the VNC cumshaw of

00:17:53,860 --> 00:18:03,960
the washing machine on the hypervisor we

00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:09,360
access no fancy page

00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:11,220
this IP leasing IP and the port and the

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:18,180
villains I pass over here and we can

00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:21,770
catch the same console so how no

00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:25,590
buoyancy and the web certified is

00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:30,120
integrated into our system first I will

00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:35,040
introduce how and where console works in

00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:37,350
a patch Cal Tech we have a works ok sir

00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:41,130
I will have a managed server we have

00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:45,720
some hoppers with VM running and when we

00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:49,020
start we set up a tool in plastic it

00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:55,410
will create console Cox appeared and it

00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:59,660
has 2x lovely we do not take the local

00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:04,470
IP into consideration it has a public IP

00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:09,590
Paltrow has a magnet a key when cotopaxi

00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:09,590
p.m. is running it will send come out

00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:18,980
too many server tell the men servlets

00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:21,440
I'm ready and the minister will send

00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:25,620
send back some information to the

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:30,150
control to the end call surveys in the

00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:35,640
comes about p.m. we will start concept

00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:38,220
of agent and when we now if we try to

00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:41,760
access a consul of I am from our browser

00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:46,590
it will send request to the menu server

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:48,090
and many server will send count to the

00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:53,420
hypervisor where they'll be arbitrary

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:58,750
and sent back with the answer to the

00:19:53,420 --> 00:20:03,090
men's server I contains the

00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:08,530
IP and the port of the BM Sarah will

00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:13,660
compose uija which contains public IP of

00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:17,320
the control box VM token token is in

00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:20,560
credits information contains costs of

00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:24,450
the hypervisor and the brain supports

00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:31,000
basic password VM UID and the time step

00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:33,220
so now we try to access the UI from our

00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,750
browser it will send a pass to

00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:43,320
consecrate VM and control VM we will

00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:43,320
create the token and the access

00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:53,410
hospitals IP and the million sea port

00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:56,080
with the music password now this is how

00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:58,320
we access the console of the washing

00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,320
machine

00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:07,350
so before we integrate no VC and the

00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:09,149
websocket fact into our contact we first

00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:11,549
need to answer

00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:13,499
so this problem how to access multiple

00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:16,200
servers because in our example we are

00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:21,960
able to access single VM on the

00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:26,879
hypervisor and the hypervisor is to

00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:32,489
comply it can be used in two ways first

00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:36,929
to compare token and the corresponding

00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:42,029
IP and port saves in the token file open

00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:46,230
nebula use this and you know stack it

00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:48,899
use different solution all this

00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:52,830
information are saved into database so

00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:59,070
if we can if we pass the token from

00:21:52,830 --> 00:22:01,950
browser service will resolve against the

00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:08,009
IP and the port from Davis then we can

00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:13,289
access the console of the VM most of the

00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:17,179
controversy cost of the console console

00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:17,179
proxy and report and also

00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:29,910
this two ways both applicable for

00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:34,680
clothes back because in open nebula and

00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:39,480
the OpenStack know Regency council is a

00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:43,650
service running on the medicine but for

00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:50,910
us we this servers are running on

00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:54,060
cotopaxi BN so so we are trying to fix

00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:58,500
this problem at the end we decide to

00:22:54,060 --> 00:23:01,250
redefine the bathroom yeah in web

00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:04,170
certified so all the information will be

00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:06,090
equipped with encrypted lender server

00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:09,510
which contains some information and

00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:12,300
decrypt WebSocket by using a shared

00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:17,640
global CP between many server and the

00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:23,060
consequence VM so we need some change in

00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,060
the WebSocket pack how it works

00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:32,780
same how service same absolute nobody

00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:36,020
I'm the websocket I installed on top of

00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:40,970
CBM the same as before

00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:45,170
here the command is different before it

00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:49,340
contains more information than our

00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:55,460
current solution will contains the

00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:57,740
shared pay of millions upon so when the

00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:01,130
pastor base catch the amount it will

00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:09,170
start low in signal and the WebSocket

00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:12,760
server now the same same catch the green

00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:17,000
support answer to Mini server and

00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:19,360
compose you I know it's painful and get

00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,360
first

00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:30,630
so here you are which no B&C provides

00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:35,480
and ours similar token contains some

00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:38,670
images a sports playing IP from that

00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:48,360
signature and also the Vincent password

00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:54,660
here access do I catch counterproductive

00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:58,290
um well this since the Nova in C webpage

00:24:54,660 --> 00:25:03,570
to the browser and start with green C

00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:09,690
handshake I WebSocket server yeah this

00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:14,820
is the no B&C console get harbor if we

00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:20,160
look at the source code of Zilla

00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:22,740
ice-cream can see the you are actually

00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:25,760
you are a witch observe no it's council

00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:30,650
over the sea that's possible is here

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:37,140
the password is billion C passwords and

00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:40,940
it might cause some secret risk so we

00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,940
are trying to fix it

00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:51,679
first I will introduce how to cook to

00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:55,100
the west server so to have a client and

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:57,559
a server and the client in kind starts

00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:01,880
with she had jet with the server will

00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:04,580
send the heist IP protocol to client

00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:07,580
client we have send back the actual

00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:12,080
Africa quad code to server and the

00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:16,970
server will share with the clients hive

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:20,419
of authentication and sir he used

00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:23,390
valency of PG and the BIM server was

00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:26,870
sent challenge to the wind these clients

00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:31,690
in this time cats challenge will in

00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:35,299
create charge using the busy password

00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:40,809
very important and win-win super cats

00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:44,480
the encrypted information check and

00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:51,260
syntax result of post patient back to

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:57,919
the client when Stan start various

00:26:51,260 --> 00:27:05,320
collection so in the traditional novalee

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:10,669
and WebSocket I set up the WebSocket is

00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:13,220
acting as a pure proxy so for words the

00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:18,530
traffic from the notes times between the

00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:22,809
basis of it back end means the brain

00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:26,120
c-shaped handshake is here and in

00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:28,760
variants a or secretion the basic client

00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,840
has two inputs has to pass the way the

00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:34,620
possible

00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:39,570
so how to solve this part the Seawatch

00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:43,590
our competitors and in OpenStack you do

00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:46,649
not have to Vince a password but it

00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:50,100
means if you have access to the private

00:27:46,649 --> 00:27:52,889
IP of the server we can maybe access the

00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:57,419
console of all the voting machines of

00:27:52,889 --> 00:28:02,190
hypervisor without impossible I think is

00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:07,110
a very big security problem and I did

00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:10,259
say some requests in a mastectomy no

00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:16,080
response and opened a burner

00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:19,559
we provide two solutions first at the

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:24,269
password you are same as I said just now

00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:31,190
and sector between the pop-up turnout

00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:31,190
you ask users to input the password many

00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:39,330
customer has to get a password and input

00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:47,909
them manually it's not convenience from

00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:50,090
users the interface how to solve this

00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:50,090
problem

00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:58,360
but if we can remove the waste handshake

00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:03,879
between the load skeins and the way the

00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:13,360
server to WebSocket I in the problem

00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:17,679
consult to achieve this one I had some

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:22,600
codes in WebSocket five server so it

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:25,769
will support novice handshake if we pass

00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:31,539
the busy password and also I changed

00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:35,429
knowing save so it's compact always so

00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:39,999
depend the modified log certified both

00:29:35,429 --> 00:29:45,309
has been uploaded to my kata and now if

00:29:39,999 --> 00:29:48,399
we set up a WebSocket server password

00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:53,619
download the weensy from my paper and

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:56,980
launch new widget server decent IP and

00:29:53,619 --> 00:30:01,090
the port and the reason here from what

00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:07,470
browser we do not you pass the password

00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:11,590
anymore the password is not here so

00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:17,440
based on the new modified WebSocket on

00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:22,389
Lucy I change the code change our input

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:24,730
implementation yeah the password is not

00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:27,340
here anymore and it has been moved from

00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:30,720
you are to the past

00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,720
so it's now easy hook it

00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:42,359
in summary a summarize we invented a new

00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:46,819
console for voting machines in classic

00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:50,879
you use nobody as the web-based client

00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:55,609
has battery user interface you use a km

00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:59,549
v and we use web profile is a per se so

00:30:55,609 --> 00:30:59,999
so continuous protein is not needed

00:30:59,549 --> 00:31:04,819
anymore

00:30:59,999 --> 00:31:08,039
and also because we use mod fellowship

00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:11,459
580 password is not available for the

00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:17,519
users so I've created two prepares on

00:31:11,459 --> 00:31:19,349
our hosts github one for the mystery man

00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:25,939
for photo 11

00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:32,869
yes if you are English please Tessa and

00:31:25,939 --> 00:31:32,869
institution and problem report I welcome

00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:46,979
demo that few options because WebSocket

00:31:42,089 --> 00:31:50,579
WebSocket is not secure protocol so the

00:31:46,979 --> 00:31:54,719
secret never depends on which I keep a

00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:58,169
pothole we use if we create WebSockets

00:31:54,719 --> 00:32:01,079
person over at appeals and it's not ask

00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:06,079
you if we create a key WebSocket

00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:10,579
question over at yes I will

00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:10,579
drama which separated me

00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:20,440
this is the homepage for our first time

00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:29,520
of the steps to config unscrew the wins

00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:29,520
console next our price work for sorry

00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:43,810
course go to the global settings change

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:47,790
to settings as labor force and we said

00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:47,790
no a signal so it was a default console

00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:59,620
and we go to infrastructure system

00:32:54,370 --> 00:33:02,020
reacts and destroy the currents running

00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:04,420
console port VM and the close back will

00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:09,670
create an new console port it was

00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:13,230
machine automatically voice burning then

00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:17,580
we are able to access the novice Council

00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:17,580
of washing machines

00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:31,530
this configuration very simple and it's

00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:38,560
a doesn't require a certificate and

00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:42,130
being a server to resolve the domain so

00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:45,280
it's convenient for the club users for

00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:56,050
the community viewers to set up know

00:33:45,280 --> 00:34:00,060
basic console and that you set up SKU we

00:33:56,050 --> 00:34:00,060
Lewis Council is a bit complicated

00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:26,780
cassetti's change the control processes

00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:33,520
we work to change well so if you are

00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:38,360
start with side the the URL of the

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:45,679
VMware start with the IP of counterparty

00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:49,720
watching she uploads as the meaning of

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,720
the certificate

00:34:50,660 --> 00:35:00,020
okay it will take few seconds and after

00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:04,000
the same ambience where we put it to

00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:04,000
work with the news as a dip it

00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:27,400
so when M is running and the aging

00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:30,849
estate is up we are go to access the

00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,849
Louis console

00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:45,950
so kartaa is not perfect there are

00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:50,550
something need to improve for example

00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:54,000
the nobility project the its doesn't

00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:58,200
manage the session so there is no second

00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:03,300
come out if we open the PEM console if

00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:06,510
we do not close the page so always

00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:13,740
walking and because of this respect that

00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:16,380
you had some has reverse proxy for using

00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:18,990
nginx for each proxy to manage the

00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:23,070
session in the conservative version she

00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:29,340
and it's also be nice to have a one-time

00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:33,840
token so if the token is used by one

00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:40,050
session it cannot be used by another

00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:44,370
session so even if we access the VM with

00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:48,950
one token under the other users somewhat

00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:54,450
chapter attackers gets the UI of the

00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:58,890
console I can cannot access Lee because

00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:59,400
the token is removed and not available

00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:05,100
anymore

00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:07,760
and in fact that you have much more know

00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,760
Mexican sauce

00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:31,480
[Music]

00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,920
start

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:20,280
for the note we can enable a knocking of

00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:24,960
nobody and the web so if I butchered in

00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:28,230
the concept CBM so if one setting comes

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:31,700
in because he's some logging special

00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:36,440
dogs in the city and I think finance

00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:36,440
that problem solution and

00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:56,300
- I also I was also thinking moving the

00:38:47,359 --> 00:39:01,550
canto p.m. at new service provides so

00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:04,520
proxy however it's the same to be a big

00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:07,270
change to contact so for now it's not

00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,270
implemented yet

00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:17,329
think about it service so we can deploy

00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:22,540
I am the member servers and when servers

00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:22,540
which has public connection

00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,529
like why you changed well

00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,780
yeah

00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,410
mmm

00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:28,510
because in 12 in this design this

00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:34,260
permutation there's a conservation in VM

00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:34,260
which handled actually handle the

00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:42,400
vacancy I was 18 and with the paper

00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:47,310
avenge the cloud service tier do a lot

00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,310
of scenes because you see

00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,870
[Music]

00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:47,369
so

00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:17,780
that's a suggestion I agree with you

00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:20,809
that that might be a puja here to take

00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:38,510
see remark in constant into

00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:38,510
consideration can investigate on us

00:43:40,550 --> 00:44:10,910
wait was there any way to host the IP

00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:14,780
the UI host and what we know is this is

00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:17,870
actually the same was IP and port you

00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:23,120
are not to the IP and port of the VNC

00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:25,990
server so it's the cost changes for

00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:31,630
these services so it doesn't matter

00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:31,630
actually if we remove this one it's also

00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:35,649
[Music]

00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:08,170
yeah

00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:13,539
[Music]

00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,960
[Music]

00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:48,889
[Music]

00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,260
[Music]

00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:21,619
but I didn't has it possibly I think

00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,619
might work

00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:42,570
[Applause]

00:46:44,529 --> 00:46:51,200
tomorrow my colleagues jefra and Panem

00:46:48,529 --> 00:46:54,680
will talk about the nessing's only

00:46:51,200 --> 00:47:01,130
microwaves 3012 is a container to class

00:46:54,680 --> 00:47:05,559
tech they don't be a lot of room so you

00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:05,559
