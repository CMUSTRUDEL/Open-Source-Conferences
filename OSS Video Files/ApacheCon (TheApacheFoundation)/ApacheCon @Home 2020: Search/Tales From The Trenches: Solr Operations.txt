	Tales From The Trenches: Solr Operations
Mike Drob

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

There are many pitfalls that a team can fall into when designing and implementing a new Solr-based search application. We will draw on stories from the presenter's operational experience and distill the events into easy to understand patterns and anti-patterns. Topics covered would include query patterns, indexing patterns, and shard design.

An engineer with over a decade of distributed systems experience, Mike has spent most of his career helping enable others who are using big data platforms. He is a PMC member and committer on several Apache projects, and strongly believes that when people develop breadth in their expertise it builds better software all around. When not working, he enjoys photography, dogs, photography of dogs.
