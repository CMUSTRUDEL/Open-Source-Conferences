Description: 
	Solr's new Plugin System

Solr 8.4 has a new plugin system that portends of a better future much improved from today: (a) load plugins at runtime, (b) find 3rd party plugins in a registry, (c) fetch, install, and even configure plugins from the command line (CLI), (d) a more slimmed down Solr distribution that is more secure. After an overview, you will see this system demonstrated, after which you should feel comfortable in trying it out for yourself when you leave. Beyond the CLI demonstration, we'll look behind the covers a bit to show some of how it works. We'll finish with a discussion of the gaps and thus what the future hopefully holds as this new mechanism blossoms. You'll learn a bit about what it takes to "package" up your plugins too.
