so good morning ladies and gentlemen

00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:09,480
very pleased to see so many of you here

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,429
this morning I had a talk with one of

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,500
the security staff in the elevator and

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,839
discovered that some people have failed

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,810
to answer their alarm calls this morning

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,630
which always gives problems to the

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,910
security staff in a hotel so perhaps the

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,099
Portland beers have been tasted rather

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,390
better than wisely last night for some

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:29,880
people but it's good to have a nice

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,590
crowd this morning and we're starting

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,660
off this morning with the business panel

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,700
which runs for an hour from 830 till

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,980
nine-thirty in the capable hands of the

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,989

of switzerland I work for Adobe as a

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,950
senior developer in the cq5 team which

I did have my own business for 18 years

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:34,470
before joining de software which should

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,509
then go to quiet by Adobe feel robbed

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,619
hewlett-packard I run the open source

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:43,380
program office for hewlett-packard and

00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:45,450
that role is somewhat of a mix of

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,950
working with the community and working

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,710
with the different business units inside

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,320
of HP I run our open source program

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,020
office and the open source review board

i sponsor and participate in events like

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,909
this and work with the teams within HP

for basically strategically how to

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,409
evolve and work with open source from

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,860
fort collins colorado and it was rather

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:10,700
snowy trying to get here my name is Mark

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,310
Hinkel I work with our

00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:17,450
relations with Citrix particularly with

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:20,660
the Apache CloudStack project and Zen

00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:23,269
org and because of the success we've had

00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:25,129
with Apache we were looking at some new

00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:29,930
open source projects this year that will

00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:31,849
talk about second quarter fantastic

00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,890
thank you so a little bit about the

00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:37,040
panel we've been running this panel for

00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,450
the past eleven Apache cons and what we

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,920
normally do is I usually have a couple

00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,569
questions that allows the panelists will

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,650
have a discussion going and then we open

00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:44,120
it up to the floor because you guys

00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,620
always have the interesting questions

00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,380
and we've got some great answers for you

00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,599
so when we first started this I think

00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,940
the topics have changed considerably we

00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:55,010
had started off in 2006 with this panel

00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,709
and you know we were figuring out is

00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:00,950
open-source ready for primetime right is

00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:02,530
open source you know robust enough to be

00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,150
in the enterprise and at this stage

00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,500
there's over ninety percent penetration

00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,269
within the enterprise whether they know

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,880
it or not open source is there and

00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:14,000
Apache has a significant footprint in

00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,459
that space so the question is now you

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,069
know apache is clearly made a tremendous

00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:20,480
impact in the software ecosystem today

00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:22,519
and we're trying to figure out you know

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,950
why Apache why is it the foundation that

00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:27,519
folks come to to incubate and develop

00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:30,319
emerging innovations as well as

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,850
established code bases as well as mature

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,430
communities and I'm talking about things

00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,959
like subversion has come to Apache Jimin

00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,900
mentioned yesterday open offices with

00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,420
Apache flexes come to Apache CloudStack

00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:44,060
of Apaches so why is the foundation the

00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:50,269
right group for you so any panelist feel

00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:53,989
free to start answering all at once okay

00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:56,989
go I think the the defining thing is

00:03:53,989 --> 00:04:00,170
that Apache is a neutral place and you

00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:02,590
know all the Apache processes and best

00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:05,329
practices are meant to make it neutral

00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:08,599
which is very cool for a company because

00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:13,160
you know that what what you give to

00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:15,530
Apache can be can be owned by anyone

00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,630
besides Apache which also means it

00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,239
doesn't belong to you anymore which is a

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,840
can be a sometimes that you need to we

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,240
need to explain to a colleague sometime

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,070
but I think it did I think that's very

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,320
important factor having this neutral

00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,870
ground with very well-defined governance

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:38,040
rules is good place to collaborate for

00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:40,620
companies I guess I would answer that

00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,360
question is when we joined Apache I

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,840
don't know that we were all sure it was

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,639
the right place for us it was very we

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,160
had a open source project which is

00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:53,940
CloudStack which is now incubating in

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,820
Apache and it was fairly highly debated

00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:00,120
about how we should take our project to

00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:02,490
the next level internally and we decided

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,330
on Apache for a number of reasons and

00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:08,960
what we found is that the Apache brand

00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:11,700
as far as giving legitimacy to a project

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,280
has really helped elevate the status

00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:18,060
because of the the procedures in the

00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:21,539
Apache way people people trust that

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,820
neutrality and it's actually raised our

00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:27,150
profile and improved our processes in a

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,400
lot of ways we had a very well developed

00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:32,280
it wasn't it wasn't a new project it was

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,810
already open source of the GPL weary

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,870
licensed it under the apache software

00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:40,500
license which seemed to be more friendly

00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:44,430
to our partners into our users and the

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:47,849
governance model that was neutral has

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:51,840
really helped push the project forward

00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:54,450
so i think that i would tell you now

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,060
that the apache way and the confidence

00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:59,669
that people put in the patchy Software

00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,729
Foundation has really been a big asset

00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:05,970
to us yeah and from from from our

00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:07,800
perspective it's actually it's even more

00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:10,680
influential than just within the Apache

00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,930
community itself we have lots of teams

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,180
working within the Apache environment

00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:17,760
and within the Apache foundation proper

00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,760
but even with working with projects like

00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,830
OpenStack which chose not to go into the

00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,229
Apache foundation but because of the

00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:28,770
maturity and the strength and the

00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:30,780
reputation of the processes that the

00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,580
Apache Foundation have had with regard

00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,219
to license with regard to license

00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,289
contributor agreement even the technical

00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:38,520
structure of meritocracy with program

00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:39,810
management committees or project

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,240
management committees and so forth

00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:45,150
that's the model that is commonly used

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,890
and referred to now wherever a project

00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,930
is being created as a really best

00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,400
practice and that's something i think

00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,930
the apache foundation should be really

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,700
proud of because you're leading the way

00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:59,310
in that fantastic burch one you

00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:01,229
mentioned that um you know speaking to

00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,440
your colleagues reminding them that what

00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:07,140
you have doesn't belong to you anymore

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:10,710
the late american author gore Vidal had

00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:13,440
said whenever a friend succeeds a little

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:16,050
part of me dies so it's interesting

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,719
because how big of a challenge is it you

00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,280
know with again open source and apache

00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:22,260
way and the whole community friendly

00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,240
kumbaya business how much of the

00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,650
challenge is it to be open and community

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,229
friendly and yet be competitive at the

00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:30,360
same time I mean again I'm sure there's

00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:32,330
there's a cultural aspect to it but

00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,409
there's also real business numbers

00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:36,539
competitive element to it so this is

00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:39,840
really for the whole panel yeah I think

00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:42,510
the key to to this is to choose the

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,990
right scope for the project for what you

00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:48,389
open sourcing so I I used to work for

00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:53,479
day software before joining Adobe do

00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:56,400
which was a small Swiss company and we

00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:59,460
about ninety percent of our product is

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,380
based on consists of Apache projects

00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:06,090
it's still the case now the project the

00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:09,389
product is Adobe cq5 hasn't changed so

00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:11,580
we made a conscious decision to not open

00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:14,789
source the higher layers you know the UI

00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,860
stuff because first it's very hard to

00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:19,110
agree if you ever tried like to choose a

00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,659
color for a button on an Apache mailing

00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,659
list you can you're in for for some

00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:27,090
debate usually so it's it was much

00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:29,340
faster for us to keep that part for us

00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:32,219
but we open sourced all the

00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:34,200
infrastructure parts which are common

00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,849
and reusable and that that's where you

00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,630
really benefit from collaborating with

00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,490
other

00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,710
other companies who might be competitors

00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:44,430
but need the same thing at this level

00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:47,250
and then the benefits are greater than

00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:49,170
done what you might lose by by opening

00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:53,070
opening it up so I think it's a question

00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:54,840
of choosing the right amount you know

00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:57,270
the right scope in what you open source

00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,460
to make sure its infrastructure and it

00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:02,280
also makes it easy to work on with other

00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,810
people yeah from my experience in

00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,900
working with a lot of different projects

00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:10,520
and partners I think that's really a

00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:12,900
question that hasn't been answered yet

00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,720
one of the fascinating things to me

00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,640
about open source is when you put a

00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,690
bunch of technologists together

00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:23,010
collaborating on some kind of of item

00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,870
they self organize and they produce

00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,660
better software than anybody else any

00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:29,310
place else and it's really because it's

00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,710
all about the software it's not about

00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:33,570
you know they their users are they know

00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:35,160
who their users are they address their

00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,860
users very often their users are

00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:42,480
themselves so they know their users very

00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:45,570
well and that model again is really hard

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,090
to combat you know I like to talk in the

00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:50,130
fact that open source communities make

00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,190
outstanding technologies but they may

00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,800
not necessarily make a great solutions

00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:57,030
they can put you know a lot of great

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,920
functionality out there but you know I

00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:01,560
think the the opportunity for companies

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,240
is to form that up into a really

00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,710
well-rounded solution because there's a

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,180
variety of things that communities

00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:09,000
typically find boring and don't really

00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:12,150
want to do well so helping to fill that

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,550
out to provide something for customers

00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:16,320
where businesses as what was supporting

00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,000
it long term those are the things that

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,070
businesses can do and I for me that's

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,050
the balance between the two and why they

00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:29,330
can work so well together I think one of

00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:32,520
the most attractive things about the

00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:36,780
open source in general is really the

00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:40,470
user led content development but the

00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:42,720
context that they bring and so for us we

00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:45,570
r software company and sometimes where

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,280
you know solutions looking for a problem

00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:53,080
but when you do it and so

00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:56,590
you get user context and by by having

00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:58,680
that for us having that more intimate

00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:01,240
engagement with our users to actually

00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:04,020
leap feature development and product

00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,790
development it really has you know

00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:08,230
informed how we develop our software and

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,480
what features are there and why it's

00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:14,800
going to get better and I think that to

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:18,760
me is is really what what has taken us

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:21,640
forward and is is well while it is a lot

00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:24,430
of loss of control as Sally said it is

00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,200
also you know you do get get much more

00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:30,040
than you give away when you really

00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:32,410
embrace that I think there's also an

00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,120
interesting aspect with respect to the

00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,410
integration again you know a lot of

00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,760
companies are saying okay we're open

00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:39,190
source friendly or incorporating open

00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,170
source that happens on a software

00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:43,860
development technical side in marks

00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:46,390
instance you know your organization is

00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,920
very diverse you have many business

00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:50,410
units that you know are not even

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,580
software oriented we're time you're

00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,700
coming from an organization that got

00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:57,190
acquired by Adobe and you know yes they

00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,230
now very visibly have an open source

00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:01,510
presence and activities the same with

00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,950
citrix it's interesting that on the

00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:06,250
panel now we have three organizations

00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:08,230
that were not natively again your former

00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:11,350
life was but are not natively in their

00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:14,260
DNA open source so seeing that you know

00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:16,090
folks are involved sleeves rolling up on

00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,830
the developer side saying okay we get

00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:19,630
the apache way and implemented across

00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,860
the board birotron I know you're giving

00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,240
a talk about open development i know

00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,280
that's a significant part of what you do

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,200
mark i understand that your team is very

00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,030
heavily involved with governance you

00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,830
know it's interesting i know that you

00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,420
guys and also fill your group also is

00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,920
very involved with governance how is

00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,350
that influenced the way the organization

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:38,100
is working as a whole you know it has

00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:40,600
the apache way and other open-source

00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,250
activities involved and has influenced

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:47,380
your organization beyond just software

00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:49,480
development works laughing it's actually

00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,700
you know it's caused a good bit of

00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:55,600
strife in some pain because it's a

00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:57,850
culture change I mean when we were

00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,779
before Apache but we weren't quite as

00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:04,360
democratic so there is the room and you

00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:06,579
know what I I would love to tell you

00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,740
that I just loved it from day one but

00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:12,699
every day it's a little bit of a

00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:14,199
struggle because I move at what was a

00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:17,380
company you want to move at a certain

00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:21,130
pace and I've heard in multiple talks

00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:25,329
this week that Apache moves on Apache

00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:28,120
time and you know at first I had a hard

00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:30,519
time grasping that because i want to get

00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,279
stuff done I want to get product out but

00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,930
the reason it works is also because

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:39,720
there's a process and if you follow that

00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:42,970
process you get a good result so I think

00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:46,240
we find a lot of times that we're at

00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:48,610
odds with this pace that our community

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,319
needs to move that and our business

00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:54,880
needs to move that and that's you know

00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:58,120
as anyone here who works in an a's works

00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:02,290
at selling free software if you figure

00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:04,000
out that you need to embrace it and not

00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:06,220
fight it and it goes a lot better but

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,670
you also have to really understand that

00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:11,380
apache culture and and that's that's

00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:14,250
something that you got to work at every

00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:16,839
day or else you're not going to succeed

00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:19,029
yeah and the model the model is it's

00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:20,949
it's a continuing evolution right there

00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:23,259
there are many product teams inside of

00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:27,009
HP that fully understand and get it and

00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:28,990
they've adapted the model because again

00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:30,910
most of their code base or significant

00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:32,589
portions of their code base are based on

00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:34,269
an open source project and so they

00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:35,889
understand you know what that

00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:38,050
collaboration means what they're going

00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:39,519
to get from the community what they need

00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:42,490
to give to the community and how that

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:46,120
equates ultimately into again a solution

00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:47,920
for the customer but it's again that's

00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,720
part of the fun of my job is I get to go

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,149
around and try to explain this to folks

00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,620
you haven't quite seen it yet and there

00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:57,459
are still many folks that are that way

00:14:53,620 --> 00:15:01,089
both inside and outside of HP I would

00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:02,420
say the one important aspect of the open

00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:05,149
source model and

00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:07,790
that often creates a tension with the

00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:10,370
company you know the how do you say

00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:14,060
maybe the old company model hierarchical

00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:16,100
and stuff is a meritocracy I think it's

00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,230
a natural thing for engineers to be

00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,300
meritocratic you will respect someone

00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,430
because they because of what they can do

00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:25,209
in the project and that that's what we

00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:27,740
do in Apache your your power is only

00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:30,290
measured in terms of how much added

00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:33,290
value can you bring to this area of the

00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:35,899
project and then and sometimes we have

00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:37,790
you know stars coming as commuters to

00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:39,949
New York New Apache project they don't

00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,329
have special status there are committed

00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:43,490
like everybody and they have to be

00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:46,399
elected and stuff this is very different

00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:48,110
from the old company model where you you

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,029
had the power because you are the boss

00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:52,430
someone tells you all know you're now

00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:55,699
you are the boss sorry so people just

00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:58,339
have to do what you say obviously you

00:15:55,699 --> 00:16:00,260
need some form of bosses in a large

00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:02,300
organization you need some some order

00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,769
and you need to ship stuff some someone

00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,170
has to say at some point okay tomorrow

00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:07,670
is the release do whatever so that we

00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:09,440
can release it and then there's a

00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:12,589
tension with between that and the

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,300
meritocracy and I think there's good

00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:17,720
progress being made in general in

00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:19,610
companies in making making more sense of

00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,790
that you know how can you combine the

00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:26,269
meritocracy with some form of leadership

00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:28,160
that that's required by the business and

00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:29,420
meritocracy is great because I think a

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,829
lot of folks feel like they can buy

00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,480
their way into the foundation I will

00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:35,870
become platinum sponsors will have you

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:38,329
know special access allowed to us or

00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,890
we'll be able to you know commit code at

00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:41,149
a higher level than someone else or what

00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,320
we choose to do and the project

00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:44,120
management committee is going to dictate

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,500
the way our project goes so it's very

00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,910
interesting to see that it is really

00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,550
based on the individual and individual

00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:51,230
contributions what's interesting also

00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,209
again in the evolution of open-source

00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,560
adoption is for years people were saying

00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:56,449
okay we're getting involved in open

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,069
source because of the cost savings right

00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:59,899
so back in the day is to be you know

00:16:58,069 --> 00:17:01,250
build versus by and then open source

00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:04,850
comes along and you go well you can just

00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:08,390
borrow and sometimes give back so you

00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:10,429
know there's there's an issue about cost

00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,600
savings in general even now I mean again

00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,380
we're talking about more larger

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,560
organization

00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:18,310
market valuations shifting Accenture

00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,810
recently had a survey that stated CIOs

00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:22,670
actually cost savings is the least of

00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:24,530
their concern and yet folks are saying

00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,970
hey wait a second i want to get on to

00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:28,190
this gold rush because there's some

00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:30,710
money to be made here there's been a

00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:32,750
projected valuation for the Apache

00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,910
Hadoop market to exceed 14 billion

00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,530
dollars over the next four years we're

00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,030
talking about big money to be made and

00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,320
everyone's kind of holding other hand up

00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:42,410
and saying we want to be a part of that

00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:44,060
so talking about money you know again

00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,520
there's there's powerhouse products out

00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:48,530
there Apache seems to be behind a lot of

00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,940
them were enabling a lot of them pushing

00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,200
a lot of those projects out those and a

00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,000
lot of companies are taking them up and

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,380
saying we want to be a part of this so

00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,540
what do you guys think are the biggest

00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:59,360
challenges and and and fill it mentioned

00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:01,760
education is an ongoing issue and again

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,610
I presume the topics now if in terms of

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,480
Education have shifted greatly so what

00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:09,560
do you guys think are your biggest

00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:12,320
challenges that lie ahead and its

00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:15,880
challenges in what context opportunities

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,880
problems what keeps you up at night

00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:27,750
well I mean from a from a standpoint of

00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:30,630
I've watched the the I've watched both

00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:33,090
internally and externally to HP the

00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:37,350
concept of saving money being less and

00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:39,330
less important as teams get into open

00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,640
source they recognize it really is about

00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,560
the flexibility that affords them as

00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,980
Sally said you used to have x versus

00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:49,410
build right and if you build it it's

00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,660
custom it's typically very expensive

00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:54,900
half the time it doesn't actually make

00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:57,150
it to fruition you know the rate of IT

00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,820
projects dying somewhere along the road

00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:04,200
to first release is pretty large in the

00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:06,000
history of corporate ID so cots was the

00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,500
big buzzword right back in the 90s early

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,660
2000s you wanted to do everything

00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,480
comment off the shelf and when

00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,880
open-source really took hold it created

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,280
this middle ground where very often you

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,470
can treat open source as cots you can

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,890
buy Linux from red hat and belt treated

00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:27,690
just like burn a version of UNIX from

00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:29,640
any other vendor for us and for so many

00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:32,370
of our customers you know the ability to

00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,920
bring a piece of open source in treated

00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,300
as though you wrote it meaning you can

00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,280
fully support it you create a

00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,590
relationship with the community that

00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:43,410
code can be treated as yours or if you

00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:46,380
choose you can have a variety of vendors

00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:48,570
help you either extend it or support it

00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,760
or do whatever right that level of

00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:54,660
flexibility with such an important asset

00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:56,190
in any company that being software for

00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:59,960
me that's one of the big dynamics that

00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:02,280
has changed from a challenge perspective

00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,460
again that the conversations have

00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:10,740
changed but the real challenge that I

00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:13,380
continue to see is just how to embrace

00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,830
open source recognize you lose control

00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:18,000
beyond what it is you can do yourself

00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:19,830
but to take advantage and to actually

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,020
just participate in that community and

00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,910
very often really good things come back

00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:28,050
and that's it's just a culture change

00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:31,160
right you talk about you know we have

00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:33,380
teams where traditionally you know it's

00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,870
then you know the architect designs it

00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:38,270
their lead developers split up the work

00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:40,040
their teams do the release they put it

00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,360
on the release schedule and that's the

00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,850
way things are done and when you

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,780
introduce the notion that ok now we're

00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,130
not going to do that all on our own

00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,200
we're actually going to participate in

00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:50,330
this outside community you know not only

00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,610
is it new for the managers but it's very

00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:54,320
new for that architect he's very used to

00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,700
creating a design and mandating what

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,140
that design is and it just starts to

00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,640
happen all right well there's a whole

00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:01,070
group of people now he's got to convince

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,640
that that's a good idea and that takes a

00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:06,620
lot of time so you know acclimating

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,240
everybody from management through the

00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:10,760
engineering staff as to what it really

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:14,180
takes to participate and work in a

00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:16,820
community that's the challenge now and

00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:19,430
it's just because the reason why that's

00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:22,640
so important is because open source is

00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:24,770
so critical at this point to software

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,510
development you can't do mobile you

00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:29,410
can't do big data you can't do cloud

00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:31,910
right all of the major areas of

00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:36,850
computing advancement today are all

00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:36,850
based on working in these communities I

00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,820
think I'd echo what Phil said as far as

00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:48,440
for us predictably bringing products to

00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:51,050
market the open source is changing too

00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,540
and the old days you used to say you

00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:56,060
know linux it's just like solaris but

00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:58,340
free and open source but now you have

00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:00,710
things like Hadoop where there is no

00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:02,270
legacy technology that the open-source

00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,820
guys are commoditized and they're

00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:07,400
actually innovating and leading a charge

00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:10,910
and big data and cloud in places like

00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:13,370
that so you have these communities where

00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:17,030
there there on the leading edge of

00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:19,160
innovation versus somewhere like Red Hat

00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:23,870
where they were we're giving you that

00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:26,450
safe stable version of a product that

00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:27,830
you understood now we have you know

00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:30,769
massive innovate

00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:33,409
going on in the big data space and cloud

00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:36,919
space that people can't have new

00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:38,929
comparison to and as a company that has

00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:41,840
to bring products to market you're

00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:44,510
always challenged by customers asking

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,940
for these leading edge features that you

00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:48,740
haven't had a chance to to vet the way

00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,690
you would have and plan the way it would

00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:54,830
have in your traditional software

00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:56,960
development models so we have that

00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:58,940
balancing act between giving them the

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,399
stability and the support that they need

00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:03,710
for their for their businesses as well

00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:07,269
as taking advantage of the innovation

00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:07,269
that's coming from our communities I

00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:13,580
would agree that the focus is not that

00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:16,100
much on on the costs anymore today I

00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:18,440
think the focus in software industry is

00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:21,500
on just making things work very very

00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,899
reliably if you go back ten years ago

00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,880
when you know when personal computer was

00:23:23,899 --> 00:23:28,370
the standard people who are getting used

00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:31,309
to software not working how many times

00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:33,320
you know I need to reboot I get Bruce

00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:34,940
cream this is not you know y'all reboot

00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,529
your computer and and people were

00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,720
getting used to that and this was very

00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:40,730
bad because you know people would just

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,529
accept that all computers never really

00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:44,960
work you always have to tweak something

00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:46,760
today with the mobile devices when you

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,980
get out your phone or your tablet it

00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,779
just works and we're getting used to

00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,730
that beginning used to stuff just

00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:54,679
working and we're faced with very

00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:56,750
complex systems behind that all the back

00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:58,970
ends and the collaborating system

00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:01,039
distributed systems so I think I think

00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:03,590
today the focus is on getting the system

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,720
to work very reliably and I would echo

00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:09,260
what what Te'o Schwarzenegger was saying

00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:11,269
yesterday on this you no need to do that

00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,340
you need the generalist who's able to

00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:15,169
understand the whole stack starting

00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,659
maybe from Hardware up to up to the

00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:19,549
system integration and open source

00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:21,380
enables that because you can look at the

00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:23,480
whole stack and you can understand it or

00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,340
find someone who understands it and they

00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,590
can have a detailed loop why is this

00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,840
thing not working so I think one of the

00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:32,149
challenges is educating the developers

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,789
that it can do that you don't you know

00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:37,010
you they should start stop looking at

00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:39,470
just their own corner and be try to be

00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:40,850
aware of the whole thing and I think

00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:43,980
that's a big

00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:45,420
that's a big educational challenge for

00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,610
for people who are not familiar with

00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:50,790
this way of working speaking of

00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:52,860
educational challenge is is it still an

00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:54,750
issue in terms of who's Apache I mean

00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,370
the folks okay they understand 404 not

00:24:54,750 --> 00:25:00,270
found and oh yeah I know those guys is

00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:01,470
it becoming more common that folks are

00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,940
saying oh yeah I understand Apache

00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,980
because of Hadoop or I understand them

00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,170
actually because you know we get where

00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,120
they come over the past 14 years or how

00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:12,510
hard is a cell in terms of Apache or

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,510
does not not even matter I think it's

00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:17,700
still a cell you know being being

00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:21,780
involved in and part of this for so long

00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:23,280
it's it's easy to see how much value the

00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,860
Apache Foundation as a whole brings

00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:28,740
beyond the web server but you have this

00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:31,410
this branding problem benefit of having

00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:34,230
such a strong initial project out there

00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:36,390
that is so dominant most many folks that

00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:40,170
i run into still don't understand how

00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:42,330
deep the portfolio right not to mention

00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:43,830
again all of the governance and all the

00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:45,540
groundbreaking work you've done is a

00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:48,000
foundational organization and open

00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:50,190
source so now i think i actually for

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,490
many it's dylan education and i think on

00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:55,860
our side for apache we very very deeply

00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:58,050
suffer from a shock syndrome so it's

00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,220
kind of hard for us i think the projects

00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:00,840
that have a very strong corporate

00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,890
backing and have a tendency to be a

00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,220
little bit more higher visibility

00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:06,660
because behind the foundation there's a

00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,190
company that's pushing that and putting

00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,870
their own marketing and PR dollars

00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,220
behind it and i think it's it's

00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:13,800
interesting because like you said

00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,270
Apaches pervasive i mean across the

00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,680
section i remember people were talking

00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:18,180
about financial services and we were

00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,700
surprised to see how much apache was

00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:23,460
there considering that back in the day

00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,840
financial services were so afraid risk

00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,730
wise of getting involved with something

00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:29,040
considered unreliable like open source

00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:30,480
and yet we're there and we're delivering

00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,820
every single day in mission-critical

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,440
applications were you know NASA's using

00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,930
us in the military is using us anywhere

00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,430
we're there and so it's it part of it is

00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:42,090
you know I think that's the the beauty

00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:43,740
and the charm of the foundation is that

00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:46,290
it's a bunch of individuals saying we're

00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,760
just guys doing great work it was just

00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:49,530
people doing good things for the world

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,010
and yet I think on a corporate

00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:52,630
standpoint they want to say you know

00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,890
we are partnering with you we're putting

00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,330
money towards you we want to have more

00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:57,550
visibility from the organization itself

00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:59,110
because we know you know when its budget

00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:01,270
time right when people say who is this

00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:03,310
and what's this line item why shouldn't

00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:04,930
care and again for me the interesting

00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:08,380
thing is you know even when you have

00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:11,140
such heavy corporate momentum behind the

00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:12,790
project such as OpenStack they look at

00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,440
the apache model and say look how

00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:16,240
they've separated the business and the

00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,610
foundational aspects from the technical

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,380
community we must preserve the technical

00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:22,390
meritocracy keep those two at arm's

00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:24,460
length and that's the model that they

00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:27,640
follow right and again that was all

00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:30,640
originated out of here and it is the

00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,350
model that smart organizations use right

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,880
to make their project successful because

00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:37,210
that's a critical part right there's so

00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:39,310
much that a corporate backing can do

00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:41,560
with regard to marketing trademark

00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:43,170
protection you know there's just a lot

00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,920
of things that can really help

00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:47,050
infrastructure for getting the

00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,870
development done but making those

00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:53,380
separate is such a key and again it was

00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:59,260
originated out of here yeah I would add

00:27:53,380 --> 00:28:01,390
that the while apache team doesn't have

00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,610
in that marketing cachet it sort of has

00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:07,260
that Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval

00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:09,310
effect and I used to like to say about

00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:12,160
CloudStack that it was the best kept

00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:14,170
secret in the cloud because people it

00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:18,750
worked very well but they didn't have

00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:21,610
that level of trust and I recently saw a

00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:24,100
report from IDC about what three cloud

00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:26,410
platform the top three cloud platforms

00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:29,340
people were going to look at at 2013 and

00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:33,450
the top one was Microsoft's luzerne

00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:39,250
Microsoft's a 250 billion dollar company

00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:41,440
VMware which number two within their 25

00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:44,800
billion dollar company number three was

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,150
Apache CloudStack and the 2011 tax

00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,430
return for the apache software

00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:50,010
foundation was seven hundred and ten

00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:52,230
thousand dollars

00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:54,480
just to see that that we were

00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:57,060
competitive in that and the usage for

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,170
numbers with sixty percent of all people

00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,880
that were looking at cloud we're going

00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:02,250
to look at Apache CloudStack so that's a

00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:05,700
testament to me to the power of that

00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:08,820
Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval that

00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,980
that Apache gives people who are going

00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,120
to use technology and by infrastructure

00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,840
they're going to they're going to best

00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:17,520
in Apache project it's it also

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,350
interesting point in terms of money

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,810
driving the market or money not driving

00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:23,730
the market in terms of adoption so like

00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:25,110
looking at Gardiner reports you know the

00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,760
Foundation's always you know Patrick

00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:28,680
projects are always hitting you know the

00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,660
magic quadrant over and over again for

00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,250
the past 14 plus years and people going

00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,080
you know how are they able to do this

00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,520
with literally what is it seven hundred

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,140
thousand dollars that we have or

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,240
something like that right it's it's all

00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,010
volunteer how is this even possible so

00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,290
it's it's an amazing testament to the

00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:45,720
Foundation's ability to be able to keep

00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:46,920
it going what I want to do is we've got

00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,360
a couple people who have kind of been

00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,070
sitting on their hands ready to jump up

00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,770
we've got a couple of microphones in the

00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:54,630
center aisle and I think it's time to

00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:56,520
take some questions because some of you

00:29:54,630 --> 00:30:00,770
were looking mighty curious so instead

00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,770
of tweeting the question come up and ask

00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:14,740
my name is steve hathaway it's not so

00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:18,220
much a question but in observation I've

00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:21,220
been involved in some of the mature

00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:24,430
Apache projects that have become a

00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:29,020
fundamental foundation of business

00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:32,830
processes and some of the projects that

00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:35,710
have seen little maintenance but the

00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:38,860
business community still sees a lot of

00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:44,490
benefit in it and my reason for getting

00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:47,380
involved in Apache was to bring the

00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:50,610
maintenance infrastructure back into

00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:56,100
some of these critical projects that are

00:30:50,610 --> 00:31:00,790
endemic and needed by business and a

00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:04,270
part of the maintenance that I've found

00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:10,210
is that businesses are willing to do

00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:12,580
quality control and I submit the pre

00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:17,770
releases of some of these projects back

00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:21,550
to business and they give us the results

00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:25,390
and approval and fun and identity of

00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:29,520
problems for additional work even though

00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:35,400
some of these businesses do not provide

00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:39,880
it direct hit direct feedback into the

00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:42,010
group's their their quality control

00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:45,250
infrastructure and business labs are

00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:48,640
very important on some of these legacy

00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:50,290
projects before you leave the microphone

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,760
I'm going to ask you a question yeah I

00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,810
know the project you're talking about

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,910
and there was one that was actually

00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:57,190
threatened to be mothballed into the

00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:58,900
Apache Incubator I'm sorry Apache attic

00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:01,060
because there was lack of activity that

00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,530
is correct but the challenge is that we

00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,720
have a lot of projects right we've got

00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:06,850
nearly 150 initiatives going on at the

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,470
foundation and you know because it's

00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:10,990
open source anyone can take it and use

00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:13,300
it fantastic so what is the markets

00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:15,730
responsibility to contribute back to it

00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:17,050
you know it's it's not a sexy project

00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,360
that you're in working on and yet it

00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:19,710
powers core

00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:23,850
Shin allottee for many many large

00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:25,680
organizations you know getting quality

00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:28,260
control is fantastic but what do you

00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:30,540
think is a way to incent companies to

00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:32,690
participate beyond just taking the code

00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:35,310
because if we don't have a viable active

00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:36,810
community or code base and the project

00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:39,870
eventually we'll get lost all diff it's

00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:43,400
not being maintained so you got these

00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:43,400
guys to help out what do you think

00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:51,750
basically it's making it talking with

00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:54,450
some of the engineers and their

00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:59,040
engineering project managers it's also

00:32:54,450 --> 00:33:03,770
sharing the information with students at

00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:07,530
universities putting projects out for

00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:11,880
work for google summer of code to

00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:15,390
increase the community the individual

00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:19,740
community participation that also helps

00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:24,510
to bring life back into projects that

00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:27,270
are going dormant I would add that I

00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:30,690
think it's the responsibility of all of

00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:33,090
us as employees of our respective

00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:35,040
employers to educate our colleagues that

00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:37,830
they should bring this information to

00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:39,780
the project you know in just sending an

00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:42,390
email to the devil you say hey we tested

00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:44,490
this it's it's cool and we we measure

00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:45,870
the to twelve percent improvement in

00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:48,600
performance on the last release or

00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:50,520
whatever brought about it and make that

00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:54,090
make that visible there's a tendency

00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:55,410
sometimes for for employees to just keep

00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:56,940
the information in there in their

00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:59,100
internal group in their company because

00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,780
they think it's enough and it's not if

00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:03,000
you're using an open source project I

00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:04,920
think it's your responsibility to to

00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,690
contribute whatever whatever you can't

00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,700
do it in that kind of my t just some

00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:12,980
test reports that that's very valid

00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:16,620
nothing on that saying note i also then

00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:17,490
when i receive kudos and good works from

00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:21,350
the

00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:24,050
a business community being chair of a

00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:28,250
project and a committer and another I

00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:31,200
share the good news and the and the

00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:33,300
testing that the corporate vendors have

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:39,210
been doing on our projects back to the

00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:42,210
list to help instill confidence that the

00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:45,270
project is well maintained I definitely

00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:47,310
agree in terms of allowing the developer

00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:50,010
community understand that your code

00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:52,500
matters and it's actually being used and

00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:54,119
appreciated again I think if feedback is

00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,250
low it's very hard for us to understand

00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:58,110
where the reaches and when you and I

00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,180
privately spoke yesterday I had no idea

00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:01,320
that the the depth of organizations that

00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,420
were using this particular project

00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,119
because in my head it was just a common

00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:07,590
belief that project is dead and I had no

00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:09,960
idea that it was being used in so many

00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:11,880
mission-critical applications and yet if

00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:15,330
we didn't know that you know how would

00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:20,100
we know so thank you for that any other

00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:24,170
panelist one of coming on to the next

00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:26,670
question thank you hi my name is Noreen

00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:29,220
it's well known that Apache is a great

00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:30,750
place for a variety a great diversity of

00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:33,330
corporations to come together and

00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:34,710
cooperate and collaborate but it's been

00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:37,200
suggested this week that there's no

00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:39,390
economic incentive to encourage greater

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,240
diversity among the individual

00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:44,430
participants as economic actors and

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,720
contributors to the foundation I'd be

00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:50,880
curious to hear what you have to say

00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:54,359
about that sure I think if you look at

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:57,180
the business of software the number one

00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:59,400
cost for us is not development it's

00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:02,430
actually sales and marketing and

00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:05,880
acquisition of customers and so if you

00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:09,330
look at someone like an Oracle even a

00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:12,390
red hat there their cost of revenue is

00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:15,780
sixty to eighty percent for customer

00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:18,690
acquisition and the open source model in

00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:20,680
general is much more efficient for

00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:24,579
customer acquisition because

00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:28,270
we don't need to go out there and do

00:36:24,579 --> 00:36:31,809
trials and our users are strongest

00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:34,710
marketing voice and our priest support

00:36:31,809 --> 00:36:38,260
comes from IRC and from wikis and

00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:41,800
mailing lists and by the time that we

00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:43,480
talk to our potential customers we're

00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,760
not talking about installing the

00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:48,099
software we're not talking about the

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,170
bugs people people are educated on our

00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:53,500
software generally and they're in a

00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:57,790
position to make a buy decision so that

00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:59,800
cost is mitigated as well as the fact

00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:01,510
that we we sort of get market research

00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,230
it helps in our leverage in every part

00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:07,740
of our business we get you know probably

00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:10,900
having jareb bugs and future requests is

00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:13,000
product mark our product management that

00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:18,190
we could only dream of we did it

00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:21,520
ourselves hiring I know not so much

00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:23,200
Citrix but netflix has a huge open

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,359
source project in the cloud right now

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,859
that has really helped them in their

00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:29,170
hiring because they're getting people in

00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:31,299
the projects and it's like an audition

00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:33,190
and before you know it they've got high

00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:36,030
quality engineers in their open source

00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:38,589
so if you look at look at your business

00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:40,359
virtually every area of your business

00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:43,030
you can get leverage through the open

00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:44,319
source model and if you're smart about

00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,700
it you're going to you're going to get

00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:47,200
marketing you're going to get product

00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:49,990
management you're going to get

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,520
development which ironically is this is

00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:53,200
a group of product developments it's

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:57,130
usually one of the smaller costs and

00:37:53,200 --> 00:38:01,450
bringing software to market so so that

00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:02,770
whole idea of leverage is as big in our

00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:07,930
business and it helps us grow our

00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:10,900
business with much less capital when you

00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:12,130
talk about diversity and I took the

00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,470
question to mean something a little bit

00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:16,119
different so could you elaborate yeah I

00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:19,839
was talking more about the diversity of

00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:22,770
individual contributors rather than the

00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:26,890
diversity of the corporations involved

00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:29,410
right and I I have a personal interest

00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:33,190
in education and

00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:34,450
education in particular HP does a

00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:36,880
variety of things like we run a

00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:38,740
technology camp for girls because about

00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,120
the sixth seventh grade it seems that

00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:45,070
engineering type of topics become uncool

00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,840
I'm fascinated to continue to read the

00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:48,490
studies about the variety of reasons why

00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:51,120
people think that women drop out in

00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:55,270
particular out of software engineering

00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:58,870
I've watched and I've watched the open

00:38:55,270 --> 00:39:00,840
source community mature and I think get

00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:04,870
significantly better about being

00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:07,450
sensitive to and the way things are

00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:10,210
presented the tone in which it is

00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:13,000
presented and conferences as well as a

00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:14,650
variety of projects there is still a lot

00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,360
of places where it's really harsh and I

00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:18,550
think that you know that has been

00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:21,640
identified as a deterrent right and I

00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:24,910
see some level of modest progress in

00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:29,530
those areas but for me there's there's

00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:31,330
still a really unsure sense of why this

00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:33,760
happens you know I can tell you from a

00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:35,590
corporate standpoint we look at the

00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,260
disparity between men and women in a

00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:40,630
variety of job categories and we don't

00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:42,820
like it and we want to fix that and it's

00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:46,090
it seems to be something relatively hard

00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:50,140
to fix because we don't understand why

00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:52,210
that as a vocation seems to drop out of

00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,860
so many women's minds in particular

00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:57,880
again just talking from a diversity

00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:59,980
standpoint about about sex so I don't

00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,600
know do you have any thoughts I have

00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:05,230
plenty of thoughts but my question was

00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:08,290
really do you see an economic lack of a

00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:10,660
lock of economic incentive to try and

00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:12,760
fix this problem it's a hard problem and

00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:14,530
how we fix the problem is a totally

00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,930
separate question and I don't want to

00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:18,640
take up this whole panel but it's

00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:21,250
interesting to hear from from you all as

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,140
economic actors whether you see an

00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:25,120
economic incentive or disincentive to

00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:27,520
addressing it right and I think there's

00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:30,130
always a very strong economic incentive

00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,380
to have diversity because that diverse

00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:35,200
set of opinions and points of view are

00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:37,000
what drive really really good solutions

00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,830
and innovative solutions so no I think

00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,510
we as an industry or missing the boat

00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:44,160
thanks Allen sees my question nothing

00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:46,980
open source is an excellent example

00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,500
because if you look at the our projects

00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:51,270
in Apache how diverse they are just in

00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,760
terms of cultures and you know where

00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:56,490
people come from we see that it's it's a

00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,710
big plus so obviously having also there

00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:01,440
is more diversity in terms of men and

00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:04,550
women would as you say will certainly

00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,550
improve that as well

00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:17,059
your question yes my name's John when

00:41:13,819 --> 00:41:19,160
i'm working for enterprise software

00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:22,020
development where to build a platform

00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:25,049
but for me apart she definitely you know

00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:27,089
for for lost over 12 years you know it

00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:30,359
has been so important to the soft the

00:41:27,089 --> 00:41:32,609
industry for my company actually if is

00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:36,690
not a party I don't want used it it's

00:41:32,609 --> 00:41:38,819
just so so important but you know the

00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:41,069
things of the early sometimes I i want

00:41:38,819 --> 00:41:43,020
to point something here you know they

00:41:41,069 --> 00:41:45,900
think of you know we know this Appaji

00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:47,789
studying in that 1999 and updated day

00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:49,950
this is a kind of really as software

00:41:47,789 --> 00:41:51,990
compared with the Microsoft that the

00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:54,599
size is small but to me is kind of

00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:56,760
really an empire I me know in the

00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:59,369
industry because the so important moving

00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,710
the world will be many ways so so many

00:41:59,369 --> 00:42:04,470
companies to support them this is a

00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:06,539
great sea but to me is like you know is

00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:07,589
empire with three thousand nights you

00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:09,900
know I mean talking about the

00:42:07,589 --> 00:42:11,430
programmers in the doing this the things

00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:15,539
that developer in though is it so

00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:17,069
complicated and is so so so important

00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:19,049
like this is Hadoop seen you know and

00:42:17,069 --> 00:42:21,240
for the last seven years it's definitely

00:42:19,049 --> 00:42:24,690
the change though it is a change in the

00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:26,760
world my pony is in right now you know i

00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:29,490
purchased organization with it with so

00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,109
many compare programmers you know throw

00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:33,839
the whole the world a model definitely

00:42:31,109 --> 00:42:35,970
work you know but what is next step in

00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:38,039
the focus on my apology imagine next

00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:41,279
five years ten years how these going to

00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:42,930
change the whole world you know there's

00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:45,240
a lot of things i think it i don't know

00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:47,520
I'm pudgy organization is going to you

00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:49,410
know take to something to the next level

00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,630
for example the education definitely

00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:53,630
huge I've been talking about it it's

00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:55,890
just that getting this hot do passinho

00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:59,099
populated you know across as a whole

00:42:55,890 --> 00:43:02,339
year the programmer debug world it is

00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:05,069
big thing you can we take some other

00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:07,140
models like it we love to come here even

00:43:05,069 --> 00:43:08,700
being here just kind of earning a kind

00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:10,500
of a pride in the owner really it

00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:12,599
because it's so important opportunity

00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:15,000
for to see the submit you know that the

00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:18,000
Creator just greater greater software

00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,250
but can we approach having something to

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,760
do you know make this look this approach

00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:23,440
the brand is the huge

00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,570
I think in talking about our pausing in

00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,280
business district is a huge I've been

00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:30,520
talking about you know we need to get a

00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,650
more developers in both is our party

00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:36,400
have infusion have any planes so like I

00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:38,860
set out some subchapter to live in the

00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,080
sample regions just like a boy a boy

00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:43,930
scout see you know either and they make

00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:47,350
this a the software well you know you

00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:50,380
know learn to quickly by the communities

00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:52,060
you know actually using this I would

00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:54,250
like that I don't know if anything

00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:57,490
making sense of this because just that

00:43:54,250 --> 00:44:00,100
very very interesting that's a good

00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:01,510
question we have several board members

00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:03,670
here I don't know if you want to talk

00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:04,960
about this but I know that rich i don't

00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:07,240
if you want to talk about it or Jim if

00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,710
you want to talk about this it happens

00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,240
like every year you know we you know

00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:12,670
we've got our board elections and the

00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,080
Foundation's going and I'm the vice

00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:16,600
president marketing and publicity so I

00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:18,310
get what you're saying and I get asked

00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,360
all the time analysts Shane your former

00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:22,690
board member if you want to talk about

00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:24,610
this come on along we get asked from the

00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:26,200
analysts and the press you know what's

00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:28,830
your plan what's the 10-year plan from

00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:30,940
the foundation and you know we we do not

00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:32,590
necessarily have these growth

00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:34,420
projections they know we're not an

00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:35,770
organization like a normal company that

00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:37,330
says we want to make a certain amount of

00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:38,440
sales because we gave our software away

00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:40,420
we don't want to bring in a certain

00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:42,070
amount of developers we're not saying we

00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,900
want to you know grow to 200 top-level

00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:45,250
projects as far as I understand that

00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,530
that's not really anything that we've

00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:48,970
ever had you know the warlord in the

00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:50,410
office and have ever said let's get

00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:52,960
together and figure out the next

00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:54,100
strategic move for the foundation but

00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,690
again there's several members of the

00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,250
board that I would love to hear your

00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:59,440
input on this Jim you're talking about

00:44:57,250 --> 00:45:06,480
it or rich or brittani want to speak to

00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:06,480
it Jim Jim all right here comes Jim

00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:16,690
already did the Hat confusion tricks in

00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:18,970
the like I'll use Sally as microphone

00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:20,680
for this um yeah Sally said I mean we

00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:24,670
really don't have a strategic plan I

00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:27,960
think what what makes the asf special is

00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:31,060
that we have always maintained the idea

00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:33,460
of a really really tight association

00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:34,870
between developers and users I mean

00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:37,900
everybody who developed

00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:42,040
the code is using the code so we have

00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:44,470
basically our fingers into newer

00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:46,570
technology because we're the users of

00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:49,060
that technology but also the developers

00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:51,400
of that technology so being basically at

00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:53,640
the ground level at the grassroots area

00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:56,740
of technologies is coming on board

00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:58,600
allows the asf to sort of like see what

00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:01,000
that new technology is and help develop

00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:03,520
it and also the very fact that we have

00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,950
this very great association with

00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,350
companies and corporations you know

00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:10,600
they're able to also provide to

00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:13,240
developers the kind of feedback and

00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:15,100
insight that rank-and-file developers

00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:17,170
never would never be able to see I mean

00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:19,540
for example you know what are some

00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:21,760
scalability problems that as a developer

00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:25,090
I may never see but may be affecting

00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:27,460
Adobe or or or IBM or red hat or

00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:29,320
something like that and so the very fact

00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:32,380
that we have this great tight feedback

00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:34,570
loop between users and developers and

00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:37,510
the asf and companies which are also

00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:39,640
pushing the state of the art you know

00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:41,890
the leading edge I think that allows

00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:46,000
Apache and developers inside of Apache

00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:50,080
to to figure out what those new

00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,420
technologies are and we're able to to

00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:54,790
ride that wave of development and

00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:57,130
advancements because we're just you know

00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:58,810
so tight to where that that is but as

00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:01,660
far as I was coming up with this idea

00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:05,520
that saying like okay next year we need

00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:07,480
to focus on this aspect that's something

00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,130
honestly I think companies do

00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,600
corporations do they try to come up with

00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:12,880
a strategy they try to come up with

00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:15,240
something that they need to sell because

00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,380
you need to create that infrastructure

00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,880
to be able to get to the point where

00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:22,090
you're developing a technology that you

00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:25,030
can produce whereas we more are there to

00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:27,970
facilitate new technologies that their

00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:29,740
company can consume and leverage and I

00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:33,310
know that rich and jada are also eating

00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:36,750
thank you Jim good just to address the

00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:39,850
what Jim was saying there is that's the

00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:40,260
micro level of how our projects work and

00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:42,510
how

00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:44,010
or we grow projects in terms of the

00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:46,680
developers and users being together and

00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:48,900
naturally interested developers will

00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,700
find interesting technologies and might

00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:53,220
come to Apache and we'll drive that kind

00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:56,400
of thing that's how it works the the

00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:57,930
bigger picture of why it works this

00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,700
sounds trite but the purpose of the

00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:02,030
apache software foundation our mission

00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:05,070
is to grind software for the public good

00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:07,470
so we've done a lot of work thinking

00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:09,750
about good ways to do things to minimize

00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:12,660
the amount of rules that we have for our

00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:14,250
projects to make it very easy so that

00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:16,560
our projects can succeed and we try to

00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:18,870
maximize the things that we can provide

00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:21,330
to our projects so at the foundation

00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:23,520
level our mission isn't to follow cloud

00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:26,280
or to look for the next big thing our

00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:28,560
mission is to allow like-minded

00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:32,760
communities to succeed in doing what

00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:34,860
they want to do so the the idea of the

00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:37,020
asf being a service to its projects and

00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:38,910
its communities and the idea of a

00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:41,040
charity in terms of our mission is to

00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:42,330
give away software good software excuse

00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:47,100
me money when we add that point that's

00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:49,560
important but that really at a deeper

00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:51,240
level drives what the foundation invests

00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:53,280
in and what the Foundation provides for

00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:55,920
its projects but what the project's want

00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:58,980
to do is completely up to the projects

00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,690
so in that way Jim's point is it is

00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,910
often corporations that end up helping

00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:04,260
to drives all that because they're

00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:06,330
looking ahead but we're happy to host

00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:10,530
any like-minded community and will

00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:12,840
support them all Shane said what I was

00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:14,370
going to say the role of the board is to

00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,350
get out of the way of projects and let

00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:18,930
them do what they want to do so Shane

00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:20,340
already said that I think it's also

00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:22,620
important to remember that the

00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:24,720
foundation with its infrastructure and

00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:27,570
with its framework allows anyone to

00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:29,520
contribute and past Apache comes change

00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:31,470
to get up during the lightning toxins

00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,940
sing this you can hack anything you want

00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:34,110
at the good old asf I don't know if

00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:37,410
you're going to sing this year Shane or

00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:39,630
not but it's it's true I mean anyone can

00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:41,610
come the barriers to entry and the

00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:43,320
meritocratic elements that people talk

00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:44,910
about is yeah you have to produce good

00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:46,560
code you're not going to break the

00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:48,480
foundation in the process of coming up

00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,920
with something we have a tremendous

00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,660
amount of folks here that have never

00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,420
been to Apache calm before and we love

00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,680
that we have

00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:56,050
this amount of people that are here that

00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,540
our new committers we love that we are

00:49:56,050 --> 00:50:00,250
trying to make sure that it's not a good

00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:01,420
old boys network you know anyone can

00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:02,980
participate if there's something that

00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:04,870
you want to do and you have a great idea

00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:07,660
this is the place to do it if it's the

00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:09,490
right fit for you and so I think that's

00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:11,020
the appeal of Apache so whether you're

00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:12,490
an individual contributor that's

00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:14,020
interested in the project you can do

00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:15,910
that or if you're an organization that

00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:17,350
wants to bring your own establish code

00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:21,060
base to the foundation you can also

00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:23,290
develop that that's when the panel I

00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:26,500
mean the only thought that I have is as

00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:28,330
I look at the organization not only does

00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:30,190
it seem to be functioning really really

00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:32,590
well but it has tremendous influence

00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:34,960
again across the entire software

00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:36,970
industry because open source has such an

00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,100
influence and again the Apache

00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:41,560
foundation is such a model for how to do

00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:43,660
foundations and supporting open source

00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:46,240
projects throughout their entire life

00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:48,130
cycle so I guess it's how you measure it

00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,650
I mean if you measure it from general

00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:52,810
consumer marketing do they recognize the

00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:54,790
Apache brand do you have enough

00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:57,090
resources to function to the level that

00:50:54,790 --> 00:51:00,040
you want to function that and if you do

00:50:57,090 --> 00:51:03,160
you know if that's if that's all in

00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:05,350
place your influence as a measure is

00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:08,200
just huge I mean you're terribly

00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:09,700
successful right so I mean it really

00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,410
depends on what it is you're shooting

00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,850
for and when I think I just heard from

00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:14,830
the directors was it's really

00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:17,260
fundamental it's really about again

00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:21,460
letting users and developers create

00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:26,430
great software in the last couple of

00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:29,700
years there's been this prevalence of

00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:32,050
open source projects on guitar right and

00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:33,250
it's almost like the wild wild west in

00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:35,050
some ways and that there's just as

00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:37,630
plethora of them you know it's somewhat

00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:39,370
confusing but people are using at to

00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:42,730
sort of build some measure of community

00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:45,070
dynamics sharing code using the Apache

00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:48,370
License often I guess my question to the

00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:50,890
panel is given that this is relatively

00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:53,680
new phenomena and is it causing you to

00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:56,290
somewhat redefine what goes into get her

00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,849
what goes into the asf as a government

00:51:56,290 --> 00:52:01,109
project

00:51:56,849 --> 00:52:03,989
mask usability etc yeah i would say in

00:52:01,109 --> 00:52:05,930
our case that that that's discussions

00:52:03,989 --> 00:52:10,829
that we've been having with some groups

00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:12,450
if we have a so i'm not i can't speak

00:52:10,829 --> 00:52:14,460
for the whole of adobe because it's too

00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:16,739
big but for in the groups that i'm

00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:19,019
working in if we have a strategic

00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:21,239
infrastructure project it will go to

00:52:19,019 --> 00:52:23,519
apache because of the long term

00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:27,420
guarantees that the model governance

00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:28,950
provides some other groups say okay we

00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:31,019
want to go to github because for the

00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:33,390
type of things we're doing that's the

00:52:31,019 --> 00:52:34,920
right place to be there's kind of a

00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:37,109
perception that if you're doing a

00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:39,180
JavaScript front end stuff it belongs on

00:52:37,109 --> 00:52:41,069
github I don't know exactly why could

00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:43,589
very well work in Apache but there's

00:52:41,069 --> 00:52:46,200
there's both the fact that you could be

00:52:43,589 --> 00:52:47,819
maybe running a bit faster and you don't

00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:50,309
need to you know don't need to have any

00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:51,960
process which might be fine at the

00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:53,670
beaning beginning of the project maybe

00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:57,180
but yes that's a question we've been

00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:58,979
asking in several projects and the

00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:01,079
cowboy itís that you described the wild

00:52:58,979 --> 00:53:02,339
wild west aspect to it I don't think is

00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:04,890
going to change i think that's that's

00:53:02,339 --> 00:53:06,809
been the nature of the SF since day one

00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:09,059
since i've been there i think that's

00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:10,710
that's part of it and yeah i think in

00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:12,390
some instances it can be somewhat a

00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:13,979
negative experience because some folks

00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:15,119
are not expecting that because they're

00:53:13,979 --> 00:53:17,609
coming from a more corporate background

00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:20,969
but i think it's also allowing the

00:53:17,609 --> 00:53:22,499
better project emerged as a result and i

00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:23,999
think it takes a little bit of

00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:25,529
understanding of the culture and it

00:53:23,999 --> 00:53:27,359
takes a little bit of tenacity in terms

00:53:25,529 --> 00:53:29,339
of trying to distinguish maybe you need

00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:30,869
a divining rod right is it is it what's

00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:32,609
right for the project and is a right for

00:53:30,869 --> 00:53:34,259
the technology versus of the right for

00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:35,969
an individual we've had individuals

00:53:34,259 --> 00:53:37,680
who've started projects actually leave

00:53:35,969 --> 00:53:40,170
because the future of the project is

00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:42,809
better in a different direction and and

00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:44,430
and a SF is okay with that and i think

00:53:42,809 --> 00:53:46,349
it's it's something that you know we

00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:49,650
have to remember that it sits on paper

00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:52,140
apache doesn't it shouldn't work but it

00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:54,869
does and and i think part of it is work

00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:56,670
hands off on a governance level on a

00:53:54,869 --> 00:53:58,140
board level you know we let the projects

00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:59,719
run themselves and so everyone's going

00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:01,710
to have a slightly different approach

00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:02,969
some might be a little bit more active

00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:06,029
than others but i don't see that going

00:54:02,969 --> 00:54:08,180
away anytime soon but your mileage may

00:54:06,029 --> 00:54:08,180
vary

00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:15,190
mark did you want to mention anything I

00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:19,420
would just say to the github phenomenon

00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:23,200
I I think that as a rule most every

00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:25,180
piece of open source that we we invest

00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:28,390
in do we want to develop we developed

00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:32,230
within a framework that's either Apache

00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:35,520
or our Zen community and the github is

00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:38,770
really for plugins and fringe

00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:40,869
development that that is not maintained

00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:44,350
but pluggable and that sort of helps us

00:54:40,869 --> 00:54:45,820
provide that that innovation and freedom

00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:48,369
for people to create their own sub

00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:52,000
projects without our governance but it

00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:56,530
also keeps things like Apache is

00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:59,950
excellent at IP management and I like to

00:54:56,530 --> 00:55:03,340
have our core project there and then the

00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:05,619
pluggable stuff can be in github or one

00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:08,130
of the other forges and it's it's not

00:55:05,619 --> 00:55:10,660
not a not a risk for us or our users

00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:12,640
gives them the freedom okay thank you

00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:14,230
yeah one less oh sorry go ahead and then

00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,660
we have one last question before just

00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:19,300
briefly ask some at something about that

00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:22,060
is that what people often don't realize

00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:24,130
that is that by default the github model

00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:26,530
is undefined governance undefined

00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:28,330
license undefined ownership and that

00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:32,020
that's cool if you're doing a small

00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:33,730
thing and but if you if you know as as

00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:35,140
we were saying as soon as the thing

00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:37,720
becomes bigger more important you should

00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:40,330
ask these questions deal on the other

00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:43,090
side the the github tooling is fantastic

00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:45,160
so you gain that but you have to be

00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:49,840
careful about these aspects if they are

00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:51,460
important for the protein Greg Stein one

00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,950
of the patches board members has

00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:55,960
formulated a long-term challenge to our

00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:59,109
projects and that's that he challenged

00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:01,000
them to last 50 years and i was

00:55:59,109 --> 00:56:04,000
wondering from the panelists how would

00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,960
apache projects that that last for 50

00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:12,200
years fit into your corporate long

00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:16,550
plans good question

00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:18,200
with a stun panel I don't know 50 years

00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:22,099
is an awful long time in the life cycle

00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:24,050
of a piece of software so much changes

00:56:22,099 --> 00:56:26,990
right i mean i don't think it's probably

00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:29,480
appropriate for a variety of open source

00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:31,609
projects or pieces of software in

00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:35,630
general to have a lifetime that is

00:56:31,609 --> 00:56:37,670
significant for 50 years things evolved

00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:39,770
you know to the point where we can't

00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:41,480
imagine what things look like 40 years

00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:43,940
from now right so there's going to be

00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:46,660
software that becomes obsolete for me

00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:50,329
the question is more how do you build a

00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:52,099
life cycle process that allows for new

00:56:50,329 --> 00:56:54,170
projects that are addressing new things

00:56:52,099 --> 00:56:56,510
altima tlie supplanting existing

00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:58,880
projects and again with the incubation

00:56:56,510 --> 00:57:00,470
process with how that works how you grow

00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,079
how you become a mature project within

00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:05,450
this governance model for me it's more

00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:08,030
about that evolutionary management and

00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:10,280
the recognition that that that's going

00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:12,859
to happen you know when I look at Linux

00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:15,109
in particular I see a fascinating piece

00:57:12,859 --> 00:57:16,910
of technology and while you know some

00:57:15,109 --> 00:57:19,730
will argue that yes it was the remake of

00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:21,200
UNIX for me it's it's so much more than

00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:23,089
that because you know it's really the

00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,200
first time the largest server or the

00:57:23,089 --> 00:57:25,760
little thing that's sitting in your

00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,800
pocket is is sitting on the same code

00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,660
base and the amount of innovative

00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:32,300
leverage that goes between those two is

00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:34,520
just mind-boggling to me so when I look

00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:36,920
at a technology platform for operating

00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:39,530
systems I say gee this is one that's

00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:41,359
actually going to last 50 years but when

00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:43,609
I step back and I think about it's like

00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:46,099
well maybe not right i mean there may be

00:57:43,609 --> 00:57:48,230
so much change that i can't recognize

00:57:46,099 --> 00:57:50,030
that you know it linux will be

00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:52,339
supplanted by something else i mean i

00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:54,230
really can't tell so for me that's

00:57:52,339 --> 00:57:55,550
that's a really strong challenge I think

00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:58,970
it's more important that we have this

00:57:55,550 --> 00:58:01,640
structure to continue to let software be

00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:05,000
developed in the meritocracy that it is

00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:06,910
where technology and the innovation of

00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,730
that technology is what's paramount

00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:15,039
within our body as opposed to any other

00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:17,869
driving force I just add I think

00:58:15,039 --> 00:58:20,480
challenges of the projects to last 50

00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:23,240
years with the communities to last 50

00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,640
years involved with the technology yeah

00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:30,049
I think that's that's probably the

00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:33,380
spirit of what he was asking but that

00:58:30,049 --> 00:58:35,450
would be my two cents yeah I would

00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:38,089
assume Greg is pushing it a bit when is

00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:40,309
saying 50 years but in our case we do

00:58:38,089 --> 00:58:43,010
have products that we need to support

00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:45,380
for 10 or 15 years which is already an

00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:47,329
extremely long time software or that

00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:49,670
that signify product that I'm working on

00:58:47,329 --> 00:58:52,730
our customers have that kind of you know

00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:54,980
scope of lifetime so just having

00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:57,410
something that lasts for 15 years with

00:58:54,980 --> 00:59:00,020
which a working community is already a

00:58:57,410 --> 00:59:04,369
big feet and once you do 15 I think you

00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:06,289
can do 50 thank you thank you please

00:59:04,369 --> 00:59:09,319
join me in thanking our panelists we are

00:59:06,289 --> 00:59:11,089
heading into the keynote time for Steve

00:59:09,319 --> 00:59:13,220
Holden to join the stage so thank you

00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:15,849
everyone and you know always for

00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,849
additional questions

00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:21,080
