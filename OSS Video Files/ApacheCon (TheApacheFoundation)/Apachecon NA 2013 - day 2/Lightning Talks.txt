alright well time is a-wasting ladies

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:08,880
and gentlemen welcome to the 21st Apache

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:15,299
con lightning talks and if you wonder

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:16,529
where I got that number twenty first so

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:20,070
if you wonder where i got the number

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:22,140
twenty first I made it up I believe if

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,150
I'm counting correctly however there

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,789
have been 21 incarnations of the

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,359
lightning talks and so I will try my

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:32,340
best to be Brian Fitzpatrick and you

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:36,540
know not everybody can pull it off he

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,629
barely manages it there are only three

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,040
rules when it comes to lightning talks

00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:43,770
the first one and this is a traditional

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:48,149
rule there are no slides unless your

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:50,879
name is rich Bowen the second rule is

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:54,420
that you only have five minutes unless

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,760
you bribe me and the third rule is that

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,320
your talk maybe in must be in some way

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,449
related to the apache software

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,840
foundation that relation may be as

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:07,409
tenuous as you like we don't do product

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,240
pitches so without any further

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,659
announcement I'm going to select

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:18,600
randomly from the lengthy list that I

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:20,369
have in front of me of five and while

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,420
people are speaking I do encourage you

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:23,189
to let me know if there's something

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,659
you'd like to say in fact I'm going to

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,740
start off with a lightning talk of my

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,180
own to give you a little bit of the

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,770
flavor of the kind of talk that we're

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:34,170
looking for hello my name is rich Bowen

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:38,579
and I am one of the producers of feather

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:40,740
cast dot org feather cast is a not very

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,479
frequent podcast about the apache

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,000
software foundation we started out

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:50,220
talking about various apache projects

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,899
and i say we it's now just me as the

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,030
other guy that's involved is no longer

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,030
oh I forgot to start the timer didn't I

00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:03,830
talk on it anyway I wanted to mention

00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:06,890
that feather cast is looking for help if

00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:09,410
you would like to talk if you like to

00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:12,020
listen if you like to edit audio or

00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:14,780
publish podcasts if you like to do

00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:17,600
transcriptions of podcasts please let me

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,820
know feather cast has died a slow death

00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,790
and I expect that many of you are not

00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:25,760
even aware of it but it used to be very

00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,890
popular thing in the Apache community we

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,840
have quite a large archive up there of

00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,690
interviews about various Apache projects

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,530
and if you would like to help in any way

00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:38,030
please let me know so that was my

00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,280
feather cast it was less than a minute

00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,660
long hopefully most of yours will be

00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,790
more interesting so we'd like to start

00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:51,700
with Bell toll delicata speaking on

00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:51,700
behalf of the internationalization choir

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:15,360
oh you can have this one you can have

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,769
mine okay I didn't know you'd need more

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:25,830
than that maybe we can arrange something

00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:27,480
answer that phone where you can yes ok

00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:30,030
so you around you might smile on here

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:34,530
all the three of you i would pick just

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:37,440
one ready yes ok so it's not easy to

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:40,140
start this thing for many reasons i had

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,660
three singles for my choir none of them

00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,780
is here so i just found replacements

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:48,030
pretty much at random around the room

00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:50,129
that's the first challenge second

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,780
challenge is we didn't rehearse we were

00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:55,799
not going to rehearse anyway this has to

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:58,109
be risky otherwise it's not fun i'm

00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,660
always amazed at the you know the

00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:03,150
diversity of languages of cultures of

00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:07,859
people that we have here it's incredible

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:10,079
and you know I 89 internationalization

00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:12,569
is almost impossible to say but it's a

00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,910
very important topic so i thought how

00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:17,070
can we demonstrate that in an

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,709
interesting way and hopefully maybe fun

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:23,030
I don't know you guys have fun yeah they

00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:29,120
are fun so we're going to do a choir

00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:32,900
kind of a special type of choir which

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,979
you know reflects on the divide the

00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,740
variety that's also a difficult word

00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:41,070
would the variety of the people that are

00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,720
here so i give you the i18n choir I just

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,580
have to repeat the instructions because

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:50,070
these guys have no clue why they have to

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:51,960
do so we'll have a little music no

00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,300
that's not that that's a podcast I don't

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,720
want to play this one we I told you it

00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,720
was risky

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,090
going to have a little music and then we

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,729
were going to not really sing because

00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:15,860
we're not really singers but just to say

00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:18,349
a few phrases I'm going to say it in

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:23,530

different languages and still understand

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,589

many thanks to the choir I want to

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:18,970
right you ready ready all right hey so

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,640
I'm Josh marantz I work at Google on

00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:24,280
making the web fast why do we want the

00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:27,460
web fast because faster is better than

00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:30,400
slow fast makes you more money we like

00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,960
to make web pages fast we'd like to make

00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:35,080
our own webpages fast and we want the

00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,760
entire web to be fast so our work on

00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,160
some products related to this but the

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,990
message of this talk is if you want to

00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,520
make your web pages fast there's a lot

00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,750
of things that you have to do one of

00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,480
them is that you can use a really fast

00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:51,130
web server like Apache traffic server or

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,200
engine X or apache httpd event mode with

00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:55,660
keep-alive on those are all good choices

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,520
but it's not enough because one of the

00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,730
most impactful things that you can do is

00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:03,580
set up your web pages so that browsers

00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:07,750
can render them fast a huge amount of

00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:11,080
the performance is lost if you your

00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:13,330
images are bloated if you're you have

00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,970
blocking scripts in the head these all

00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:19,930
dramatically impact the ability of a web

00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:21,580
browser to render your page so what can

00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,930
you do about this well the first thing

00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,180
you can do is you can buy two books

00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:27,130
written by Steve Souders they're written

00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,780
about six years ago and they're kind of

00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:31,540
the Bible of web front-end web

00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:33,850
performance optimization or you can

00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:37,450
start to use tools you can use analysis

00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:39,850
tools including an amazing tool written

00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:43,060
at AOL called web page test

00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:45,459
which can tell you what your website

00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,740
looks like from anywhere in the world

00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:50,769
using any browser and any network

00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:52,930
connection you can say what is my

00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:56,410
webpage look like from Dublin on a dsl

00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:57,699
line on ie8 regardless of whatever

00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:00,339
browser you have sitting in front of you

00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:04,930
so before you make any changes take a

00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:07,300
look at what your website looks like so

00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,829
why aren't all websites fast all these

00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,920
rules you can buy the two books from

00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:13,149
Steve Souders look them up on Amazon but

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,360
they're kind of a pain you have to read

00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:19,149
them first of all and then you have to

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,920
go through and strip down all of the

00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:22,509
excess crap out of your images that you

00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,850
took off of your camera and using tiny

00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:26,680
thumbnails you have to minify your

00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,600
javascript files and combine your CSS

00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,519
files together and you have to do all

00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,420
this and it's kind of all kind of

00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:35,769
antithetical to the goal of making a

00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,850
maintainable website which is also

00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:39,370
important because you want to make a

00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,860
nice website so using automated tools

00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:44,290
can help with this of which mod

00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:47,620
PageSpeed which is what a tool that I

00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:50,470
work on you basically download mod

00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:52,300
PageSpeed esso installed it an Apache

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,949
turn it on and it does most of these

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:59,949
things for you if you're interested

00:11:53,949 --> 00:12:02,019
check out mod PageSpeed com this was we

00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:04,269
actually released mod PageSpeed at

00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:07,720
Apache con in 2010 and since then it's

00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:11,230
grown from zero to well over 200,000

00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,019
sites installed it's now available as an

00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,949
option a push button option on dreamhost

00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:17,170
godaddy a bunch of other hosting

00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:19,149
providers and it's also supported by

00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:22,389
edge cast which is a content delivery

00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:23,949
network in October last year we launched

00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:30,250
our one point 0 version so we have a

00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:32,199
stable release so the the benefits of

00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,240
using this module are basically the page

00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:36,550
goes faster why does it go faster the

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,019
main reason is that it crushes images

00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,579
way down almost all images on the web

00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:43,889
were way too big about sixty percent of

00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:46,990
all bytes on the web excluding video are

00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:48,750
our images and almost all of them are

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,910
unnecessary because

00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:54,640
almost all images are served with a

00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:56,890
suboptimal content type with way too

00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,690
much detail for the resolution at which

00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,490
they're displayed and this is kind of a

00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:03,670
pain to manage by hand but tools can do

00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:05,200
this really easily so turn on mod

00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,120
PageSpeed or an equivalent tool there's

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,720
lots of tools that do this there are

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:14,290
tools from Akamai from limelight from

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:18,040
strange loop there's our tool we're

00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:20,050
happy if the web that's fast so turn on

00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,820
these tools and you'll cut your

00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,110
bandwidth in half you'll cut your

00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,150
request count in half and you're

00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:30,640
generally make your pages thirty to

00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:32,770
forty percent faster at least I have all

00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,589
kinds of pretty graphics which you can

00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:39,010
see at another time so mod PageSpeed is

00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:41,230
actually built out of a core C++ library

00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:43,510
which has been ported to a number of

00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,130
servers apache httpd is the first one it

00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:48,339
also works on ng next about you traffic

00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:50,500
server the edgecast CDN google has a

00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:54,520
service that does this and it's now

00:13:50,500 --> 00:14:00,220
available in microsoft iis so i think

00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:02,830
that's about all the time I have so the

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:05,170
bottom line is try mod PageSpeed check

00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:07,209
out dub dub dub webpagetest at work to

00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:09,940
see how fast your site is dub dub dub at

00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:12,070
webpagetest org slash compare lets you

00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:16,810
see how fast your web page would be if

00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:19,740
you use pagespeed and mod PHP com shows

00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,740
you everything else thank

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,630
so clearly everyone else is a better

00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:33,610
master of timing than I am when it comes

00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:36,160
to giving these talks all right next on

00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:38,260
our list we have Noreen and I did not

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:44,160
actually get this title of her talk but

00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:44,160
she's uh yeah did you Arnie

00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:56,050
advice from my own meanderings

00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:08,280
ladies have we started lady yeah there

00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:12,290
we go anyone it now ladies and gentlemen

00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:15,060
of the open source community participate

00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:19,110
if I could offer you only one tip for

00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:21,780
the future participation would be it the

00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:24,360
long-term benefits of participation have

00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:26,610
been proved by scientists whereas the

00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,830
rest of my advice has no basis more

00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:31,790
meaningful than my own meandering

00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:37,260
experience I will dispense this advice

00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:40,560
now enjoy the power and beauty of your

00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:42,660
community oh never mind you will not

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,990
understand the power and beauty of your

00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:48,570
community until they have faded but

00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:51,030
trust me in a year you'll look back in

00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:54,060
your version control system and recall

00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:56,160
in a way you can't grasp now the

00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,790
possibilities that lay before you and

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,210
how fabulous your roadmap really was

00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:04,440
you're not as buggy as you imagined

00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:07,590
don't worry about the number of

00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,660
contributors you have or worry but know

00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:12,660
that worrying is as effective as trying

00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,970
to fix about by chewing bubblegum the

00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,620
real troubles in your project are apt to

00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:19,590
be things that never crossed your

00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:23,700
worried mind the kind of blindside you

00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:25,620
at four o'clock on some idle Tuesday do

00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:29,670
one thing everyday that you didn't think

00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:32,220
would work document don't be reckless

00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:34,110
with other people's patches and don't

00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:38,640
put up with people who are reckless with

00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:41,360
yours code don't waste your time on

00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:44,850
jealousy sometimes you're ahead

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,430
sometimes you're behind the race is long

00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:49,410
and in the end you have all the features

00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:52,360
you can handle

00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:54,940
remember the compliments forget the

00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:58,870
insults if you succeed in doing this

00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:04,290
tell me how keep your old design docs

00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:07,510
throw away your old flame wars test

00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:10,150
don't feel guilty if you don't know what

00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:12,490
you want to do with your code the most

00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:14,530
interesting projects I know didn't know

00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,570
in 99 what they wanted to do about the

00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:19,470
millennium bug and some of the most

00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:23,800
interesting projects I know still don't

00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:25,480
get plenty of peer review be kind to

00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:29,230
your wrists you'll miss them when

00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:31,960
they're gone maybe you'll release maybe

00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:34,630
you won't maybe you'll be forked maybe

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,720
you won't maybe you'll be in the Attic

00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:40,930
by 2015 or maybe you'll be powering the

00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,690
White House in 2050 to whatever you do

00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:46,600
don't congratulate yourself too much or

00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:49,860
berate yourself either your choices are

00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:53,110
half chance and so are everybody else's

00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:56,800
enjoy your community use it every way

00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:58,750
you can don't be afraid of it or what

00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,830
other people think of it it's the

00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:04,510
greatest asset you'll ever have

00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,890
communicate even if it's only with the

00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:09,910
other two people who showed up on your

00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:13,990
mailing list keep the readme up to date

00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:16,510
even if no one ever reads it do not read

00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:21,220
the comments they will only make you

00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:22,690
angry get to know your related project

00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,420
you never know what they'll be bringing

00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:28,000
to your community and be nice to your

00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:30,490
fellow contributors they are the best

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,450
link to your past and the people most

00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:36,040
likely to stick with you in the future

00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:38,410
understand that committers come and go

00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:42,040
but for the precious to you should hold

00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:44,620
on to work hard to bridge the gaps in

00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,900
geography and lifestyle because the

00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,790
older you get the more you need the

00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:53,170
people you knew when your code base was

00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:55,120
young write an XML parser once but quit

00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:57,760
before it makes you hard

00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:02,860
write a web framework once but quit

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:06,040
before it makes you soft travel except

00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:09,760
certain inalienable truths code will get

00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:12,580
tangled customers will misunderstand you

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,680
too will get old and when you do you'll

00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,330
fantasize that when you were young your

00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,240
code was clean your customer is

00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:24,850
understood technology and your c64 was

00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:26,800
user-friendly respect your peers don't

00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:30,340
expect anyone else to maintain your

00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,750
project maybe you have a doc steam maybe

00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,030
you have some great maintenance folks

00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:37,240
but you never know when either one will

00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:39,220
get carpal tunnel don't mess too much

00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,140
with your website or by the time you're

00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:45,340
out of incubation it will look like

00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:47,500
geocities be careful whose advice you

00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:50,820
buy would be patient with those who

00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:53,440
supply it advice is a form of nostalgia

00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:55,840
dispensing it is a way of fishing the

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,660
past from the bit bucket wiping it off

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,820
putting interfaces over the ugly parts

00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:05,280
and recycling it for more than it's

00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:08,280
worth but trust me on the participation

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,280
thank

00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:29,930
Thank You Noreen next up we have Shane

00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:33,800
who is going to give us his latest

00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:47,180
installment of why he loves the asf this

00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:50,870
time governmentally I'm sorry that was

00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:52,930
cut this year but you're won't be sorry

00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:55,910
good evening my name is Shane car crew

00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:58,760
and I am a lightning talk Apache con

00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:01,400
lightning talk junkie past Apache Khan's

00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,800
has seen me share my love and buy gift

00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,260
for song in the past for this great

00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,670
foundation the asf looking and

00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,870
collecting together the past lightning

00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:11,150
talks that I've given here at Apache

00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:14,170
column i can say that i really really

00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:18,050
love the internationally alphabetical

00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:20,360
statistically naked asf but tonight i

00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:23,030
will be talking about governmentally why

00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,610
i love the asf now many of you may have

00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:27,590
heard the news in the looming US budget

00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,840
crisis with the federal budget

00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:31,430
sequestration that is a significant

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,310
cutting of federal funding across many

00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:35,810
programs across the whole country

00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:37,820
despite the influence that the asf has

00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:39,980
through the installation of influential

00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,420
Apache members and committers with in

00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:45,410
key areas of federal government

00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:47,420
including the White House and NASA duty

00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:49,730
expected sequestration cuts coming it is

00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:53,180
my sad duty to announce several changes

00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:55,520
to the well-known apache way yes I'd

00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:57,050
like to low as vice president of brand

00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,880
management I'd like to lay out our bold

00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:02,300
new vision for what we will now be

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,900
calling the no patchy way yes let us

00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:11,900
embrace the new no patchy way that's n

00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:13,370
OU PA tche space WWAY so some of the

00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,470
changes that we will be announced as

00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,780
part of our new no patchy way will

00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:20,450
include a common saying we have as

00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:22,250
patches welcome well sadly do the

00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:24,860
inefficiencies present in our system of

00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:28,010
undirected or misdirected or displaying

00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:29,789
lazy volunteers all future code patches

00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:32,340
will require complete doctor

00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:35,129
entation unit test scripts full sample

00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:37,259
data before submission plus a full

00:22:35,129 --> 00:22:40,919
waiver of liability we are working on a

00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:42,809
JIRA plugin to enforce this similarly

00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:45,149
there is a tremendous amount of energy

00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:46,950
effectively wasted in long-winded

00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:48,989
consensus seeking on our many mailing

00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,669
lists this kind of behavior all too

00:22:48,989 --> 00:22:52,470
often takes on a life of its own and it

00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:55,200
distracts us from our real job here

00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:57,570
which is putting our code and apache

00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,419
projects therefore we're making a change

00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:02,940
to our mailing lists any reply to a male

00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:05,340
thread that starts with vote all reply

00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:08,129
messages will only accept either the +

00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:11,070
sign or the minus sign all remaining

00:23:08,129 --> 00:23:12,720
content frame rail will be stripped this

00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,549
will ensure a quick and definitive

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,009
resolution for all issues without

00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:19,409
distracting tangents about principles or

00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:22,950
alternate viewpoints or paint colors for

00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:25,799
bike sheds also to promote sanity for

00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:27,479
Apache committers worldwide HTML emails

00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:32,519
are immediately banned from all lists

00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:35,159
thank you now thank you dude the general

00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:38,279
trend in downsizing we will also be

00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:39,960
spinning off the less interesting and

00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:42,239
exciting projects from the apache

00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:45,059
software foundation the overhead of

00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:46,859
supporting svn get 15 different wiki

00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:49,109
installations and all the other illegal

00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:51,029
press branding headaches that supporting

00:23:49,109 --> 00:23:55,979
this projects causes is not supportable

00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:57,359
under the DOE patchy way so notified

00:23:55,979 --> 00:23:59,309
projects will be sending out

00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:01,259
notifications shortly will be given one

00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:02,789
week to clean out their desks and to

00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:05,519
take their source code with them to

00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:07,470
their new home at sourceforge projects

00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,809
being notified should contact rich bowen

00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:14,009
for a free grief management consulting

00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:15,960
for themselves and as noted in our

00:24:14,009 --> 00:24:17,639
business panel this morning corporate

00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,799
marketing teams worldwide have

00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:22,169
complained about the lack of road maps

00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:24,450
for apache software projects and for the

00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:26,309
foundation itself so therefore in the

00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:28,649
upcoming months to address this key need

00:24:26,309 --> 00:24:33,509
that we have the secret inner cabal

00:24:28,649 --> 00:24:35,399
called board dash private at we'll be

00:24:33,509 --> 00:24:37,830
pushing out detailed technical roadmaps

00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:39,539
to all of our apache projects or those

00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,900
that remain after our earlier spin-offs

00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:43,640
of course

00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:45,860
now similarly to show that the apache

00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,930
community is fully doing our part to

00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:50,900
save money for you our users and

00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:54,170
customers in the world we are announcing

00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:56,780
a a reprise of an earlier critical

00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:59,060
cost-cutting idea brought up at actually

00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:01,250
a future previous Apache con lightning

00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:03,050
talk by a large I lebrecht in Europe

00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,670
this key program will be rolled out

00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:07,310
across all of our projects at as well as

00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:11,180
all of our UI screens it's called go to

00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:14,120
black so in the go to black program all

00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:16,670
screens will be black with minimum text

00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,260
and graphics everywhere so this will

00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:19,970
ensure that there is cost savings by

00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:24,350
monetary cost reduction for all of our

00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:25,820
customers worldwide now I know there may

00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:28,100
be a lot of disappointment out there

00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:30,350
over these changes to the no Apache way

00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,850
that we are making here and i do want to

00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:33,710
assure you that the announcement that

00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:35,480
our president jim jag made at the state

00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,950
of the feather about the independence of

00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,250
apache that that no one can buy a

00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:42,170
membership seat that's that's true and i

00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:44,630
assure you'll remain strictly true in

00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:47,060
the literal sense however we do reserve

00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:48,500
the right to auction off key positions

00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,960
within the asf to the highest bidder

00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:53,120
thank you so we're sorry to announce

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,790
these changes to the no patchy way but

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,490
please please don't worry I can still

00:25:55,790 --> 00:26:02,530
categorically state that yes

00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:02,530
governmental II I still love the asf

00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:17,039
Thank You Shane I appear to have lost my

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:20,289
next speaker leave it's gone he escaped

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,299
so I would like to invite Jim up to

00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:25,690
speak about whatever it is that he's

00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:33,940
going to speak about it you never know

00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:36,639

play right on the top like this okay

00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:58,450

guilty I promise that Mikey when the

00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:36,450
keys file in subversion is real please

00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:36,450
sign my key thank you

00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:52,810
your time is running out to get on the

00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,840
exclusive list of lightning talk

00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:57,790
speakers particularly since one of them

00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,690
has escaped and we are almost now at the

00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:03,490
end of the list so I'd like to invite

00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:07,110
Louis John McGinn need to speak about

00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:07,110
putting on small events

00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:25,520
a so seniors wolf actually got about

00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:27,980
camp today I thought of it came out and

00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,220
mel nak thought would come up and see

00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:35,330
i'll be back about apache both camps and

00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:37,760
so we have a bar camp tonight and air

00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:43,630
their common denominator the common

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,630
feature for every single orgy city tema

00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:56,450
late ok so let me go hey I thought

00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,529
actually no I may actually find out you

00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,850
snow because this has been something

00:28:57,529 --> 00:29:00,559
I've been curious about for a way or if

00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:08,080
I match the only Scottish person with

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:13,419
fender foundation of them I think I'm ah

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,419
there you go anyway so we've got a

00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:30,369
speak what speak American no I the last

00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:32,889
you don't you do one start speaking

00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:38,080
English you don't want it suddenly drop

00:29:32,889 --> 00:29:39,909
dead get struck by lightning bolt so we

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,059
have got a part camp today and for me

00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:45,039
and the first part camp hours out is

00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:49,539
quite an item it intermatic thing I fear

00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:51,970
and an altered which the people were

00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:56,409
knocks hop down in the South deep south

00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:59,999
and don't typically think too highly how

00:29:56,409 --> 00:30:04,989
it's a of as barbarians from Upton off

00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:06,789
and i'm not talking about scowls or any

00:30:04,989 --> 00:30:08,830
of the other social outcasts within the

00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:13,659
european i'm talking about the glass

00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:17,230
regions and so for me the Park camp is

00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:23,859
always originally the idea for me was

00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:25,739
that it was going to be a bar and we

00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:28,649
would be doing some things that

00:30:25,739 --> 00:30:32,409
typically are quite dear to my heart

00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:34,980
like drinking whiskey and their other

00:30:32,409 --> 00:30:41,440
things which are dear to my heart like a

00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:43,389
drinking rescue and then so but none of

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,519
these things are actually true and

00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:49,649
that's not the agenda in the ball camp

00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:51,759
the bad camps actually our boat and

00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:57,820
waiting until the end of the bar camp

00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:59,950
and then drinking whiskey so that's

00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:03,009
that's hopefully what puts on the agenda

00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:04,869
in tonight and I'm sure we're going to

00:31:03,009 --> 00:31:08,139
have lots of interesting conversation

00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:10,239
can or not bill hey I don't have too

00:31:08,139 --> 00:31:15,220
much more interesting conversation just

00:31:10,239 --> 00:31:17,850
know so from the next we were you and I

00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:21,309
think I'm probably just gonna talk about

00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:22,629
the enjoyment outside so father there's

00:31:21,309 --> 00:31:25,379
some patchy corn it's my first time to

00:31:22,629 --> 00:31:27,759
portland and i was lucky enough to and

00:31:25,379 --> 00:31:28,480
received some financial assistance last

00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:30,460
year too

00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,760
to meet my be over from from classical

00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:37,120
to a Vancouver which had a great team up

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:40,960
there and there for me a this has been

00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:44,610
eventful a this particular week for more

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,870
than one or two reasons and I've

00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:51,190
currently been walking around the last

00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:52,990
year of saw with above a lump and I

00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:55,150
don't know who it was and if you're here

00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:58,419
I'm really really sorry but I took the

00:31:55,150 --> 00:32:01,809
opportunity to hijack somebody's racing

00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:05,590
bike as we left the pub two nights ago

00:32:01,809 --> 00:32:08,559
I'm then the men that are held don't go

00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:10,390
anywhere near the tram track when I was

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:14,790
doing about 100 mail on our roster and

00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:17,470
to some track and one did own money so I

00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:20,980
please if you see me stumped 10 a pop

00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:24,340
later don't don't hand me a bike or your

00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:26,530
car keys just take me some medicine by

00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:29,380
manner of [ __ ] I know I don't

00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:31,630
certainly pay you back but nor a close

00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:35,169
to rotate the executive talib because

00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:37,270
the mole is too expensive so a problem

00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:40,770
with tie up the oven I'll probably see

00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:40,770
up this dear thank you very much

00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:53,470
thank you well I see that leaf never did

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:56,200
come back and I might need to call on

00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:57,880
Steve Holden to come give a talk that he

00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:02,110
said that he could give if I needed him

00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:13,600
to fill in stever you out there or did

00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:15,340
you escape as well meanwhile anyone else

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,110
want to fill in anybody else have

00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:19,870
something that they are just dying to

00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:32,350
say and want to come up here and say it

00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:34,960
all right there is Steve to talk about

00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:37,750
whatever he's going to talk about well I

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,590
can talk a little bit about a Security

00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:44,350
and government because I'm employed in

00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:47,620
the government circles with Oregon State

00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:49,870
Police and work with the FBI and before

00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:53,920
I was coming here I was researching some

00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:57,720
of the laws on exports and export of

00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:02,110
technology come to find out I am since I

00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:05,250
don't I'm not employed by any major

00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:09,190
federal lab or encumbered by a

00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:12,850
nondisclosure agreements and this is an

00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:16,620
open forum everything is classified

00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:21,399
under a fundamental research and

00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:23,620
therefore is not exportable I mean you

00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:27,460
cannot you can all be foreigners I can

00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:30,190
be free to talk but the laws look like

00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:35,550
the very paranoid and when I get

00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:35,550
frustrated with politics i end up

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,820
resorting to some satire my diatribe I

00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:46,419
call the barbershop theory of political

00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:51,669
intelligence and what does it take no

00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:54,399
why do politicians avoid going to the

00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:57,300
barber they're afraid of losing some of

00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,300
their intelligence

00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:03,510
why do they think military folks are

00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:05,770
dumb stupid idiots they have no hair

00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:07,900
what does it take to be a politician

00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:10,030
nowadays but a big head of hair for the

00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:12,250
photo opportunities that built the

00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:14,110
ability to talk a stream of empty babble

00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:16,690
and the four hundred dollars for

00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:18,570
makeover if they can't groom their

00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:21,700
perception they have no intelligence

00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:24,460
just like a magician they perfected the

00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:26,410
art of Illusion to a fine art magicians

00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:30,100
do it with sleight of hand politicians

00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:33,250
do it with slight of head there's no

00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:35,560
science in political science just the

00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:38,470
nonsense of non science and the art of

00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:40,570
salesmanship one thing they're good at

00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:44,200
their good salesmen they can sell their

00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:46,390
grandmothers ducks chickens and lizards

00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:49,630
and the piles of excrement with a lotta

00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:52,330
bull so if you have an agenda that needs

00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:54,040
to be promoted adopt a politician it

00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:56,740
need not be able to understand the

00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:59,170
issues or the time to care but just give

00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:01,030
them the sound bites that makes him feel

00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:06,190
good and he'll promote your cause during

00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:10,030
his filibusters so when it comes to our

00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:13,410
elections what's the know whatever

00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:26,140
happened to Paul it whatever happened to

00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:28,410
it oh well if I've gone yes I know you

00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,410
do

00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:37,369
but whatever happened to statesmanship

00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:40,940
in politics that takes too much critical

00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:44,359
thinking and why when it comes Torre

00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:47,000
elections the the choices are amongst

00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:49,040
the lesser of Evil's because politician

00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,260
because States women no longer want the

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,859
job they don't want to pet to put their

00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:58,880
families through the hell and therefore

00:36:54,859 --> 00:37:01,510
we still have the paranoia and we still

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:07,000
have the security struggles and

00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:07,000
politicians don't understand thank

00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:18,619
for our last speaker of the evening we

00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:21,920
have Steve Holden who is our conference

00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:27,819
producer and i want to remind you once

00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,819
again that the the here and wine word

00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:37,670
one would think so wouldn't one i could

00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:39,650
simply threaten to keep on speaking

00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:41,420
until somebody shuts me up by doing a

00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:44,359
lightning talk of their own I should

00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:45,799
only take about how many under full but

00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:47,569
I do want to remind you that the beer

00:37:45,799 --> 00:37:54,770
and wine is sponsored by Adobe we all

00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:57,559
love adobe and that following this event

00:37:54,770 --> 00:38:01,730
there is a minibar camp event and you

00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:11,660
are encouraged to attend that so here's

00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:13,730
Steve sure okay so I when I agreed with

00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:17,299
Rick that I would do a lightning talk if

00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:18,980
if there was a shortage I didn't realize

00:38:17,299 --> 00:38:20,359
they did lightning talks with the clock

00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:23,359
on the screen is now have the

00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:24,680
opportunity to provide slides so what i

00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:28,250
will do is i will give to lightning

00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:29,690
talks the first one so you can think of

00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:34,849
it as three if this is the introduction

00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:36,650
to the other two well except for having

00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:40,510
interjected that one maybe it's for now

00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:40,510
i don't know anyway i'll let you count

00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:47,900
oh really nobody got anything else to

00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:50,420
say so anyway yes the first talk i give

00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:52,160
is a lightning talked i use to remind

00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:56,230
people that lightning talks don't

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,760
actually have to take the 45 minute and

00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:01,460
this is a lightning talk about how to

00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:08,840
give a short lightning talk thank you

00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:13,760
very much so the second one is entitled

00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:20,150
small no no no no no don't reset God's

00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:23,930
sake up here all night definitely do not

00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:26,600
reset so the second one is called making

00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:29,960
small positive differences and it's

00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:33,710
about how to try to change things in

00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:36,110
your world and the reason a lot of

00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:37,430
people will I believe anyway the reason

00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,990
a lot of people don't try and change

00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:41,240
things in their world is because they

00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:43,970
don't feel empowered to they don't feel

00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:48,320
anyone's given them permission and the

00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:50,390
task seems overpoweringly daunting so my

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,550
approach to that is just to take a small

00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:54,190
part of the problem and make an

00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:57,380
improvement in there so to give you a

00:39:54,190 --> 00:40:00,050
practical example this lightning talk

00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:04,700
actually originated in Amsterdam which

00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:07,580
is a city that I absolutely love and as

00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:08,780
I was going walking through Amsterdam as

00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:10,520
it happened I've been doing it was a

00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,380
grocery shopping because I'd rented in a

00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:17,300
small positive improve a small positive

00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:19,250
improvement I'll drink that now I have

00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:25,520
what we call in Yorkshire a balanced

00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:27,410
meal as a beer and eat so anyway yes I

00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,350
was walking through Amsterdam with a bag

00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:32,000
of groceries in each hand and I came

00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:35,330
across this nice little seat next to a

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,370
canal with the ground was covered with

00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:40,220
paper you know plastic bags and trash

00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:43,160
and bits of food and crap and people

00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:45,710
have thrown beer and soda cans into the

00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,480
bushes so since the bags weren't

00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:50,030
particularly full i took my groceries

00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:54,200
out of one bag and I put in the other

00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:55,550
and I took it was much rubbish as I as I

00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:58,570
could comfortably collect

00:40:55,550 --> 00:41:02,090
with all the cans I could pick up and

00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:03,590
then I oh this should I update the

00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:08,000
operating system it's asking me if I

00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:09,410
want to do an install here and i bundled

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,180
it all up I couldn't actually get it in

00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:13,760
the trash can so I left it by the

00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:16,250
trashcan we're probably thanks to my you

00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,200
know kind influence it blew into the

00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:20,690
canal and drown you know killed killed a

00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:23,480
swan or something I don't know yeah kind

00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:25,550
of thing that happens to me you know but

00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,640
really it's it's all about you know you

00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:32,420
don't have to make a huge difference you

00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:34,310
don't even have to do all the job when

00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,290
when I was picking this stuff up I

00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:39,080
didn't you know get down on my hands and

00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:40,910
knees and pick up my new pieces of the

00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:44,180
pair of tweezers but when I do when I'd

00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:47,150
left Amsterdam looked just that little

00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:50,630
bit better I done a little something for

00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:53,210
it I felt better about my relationship

00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:55,160
with Amsterdam I felt more a part of the

00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,780
place and really I suppose that the

00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,000
reason i give this lightning talk is

00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:01,790
because i like to encourage people to

00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,250
take part in their community and to

00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:07,240
remind them that you do not have to it's

00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:12,110
not like you don't have to write a whole

00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:13,700
httpd module all you need to do is maybe

00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:15,410
when you're reading the documentation

00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:18,050
and it's l that's really badly worded

00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:20,120
just send a note to the editor if you

00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:22,730
know who they are or raise an issue if

00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,830
you know how to but anyway just just

00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:27,320
make a small positive improvement you

00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:30,230
don't need a 15 year commitment to the

00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:31,970
project and with a million small

00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:34,370
positive improvements you will be really

00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:37,570
surprised how much the overall picture

00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:37,570
changes thank

00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:47,240
thank you all for coming to the

00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:54,349
lightning talks it looks like Nick might

00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:55,880
have something to say yay Nick so um at

00:42:54,349 --> 00:42:57,859
the end of quite a few of our talks

00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:00,079
we've said thank you I thought that

00:42:57,859 --> 00:43:02,569
maybe it's a chance to say thank you to

00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:04,849
a lot of people here because I know that

00:43:02,569 --> 00:43:06,799
we've got people here who've made large

00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:08,869
contributions and small contributions

00:43:06,799 --> 00:43:11,750
and we don't necessarily do enough of a

00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:14,270
job of appreciating all of them so I

00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:16,460
think what we should do is try and say a

00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:18,890
few of the big thank yous and then some

00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:20,809
small thank yous so for some of the big

00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:22,760
thank yous I know that we've got some

00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:27,559
sponsors in the room people who've

00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:31,309
sponsored Apache khan and the asf that

00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:33,170
means people who sponsored beer people

00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:37,970
who've made it happen so big thank you

00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:41,000
to all of our sponsors then we've got

00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:43,849
people who have helped organize this

00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,250
conference that could be people like the

00:43:43,849 --> 00:43:49,579
open Bastion you've done a huge huge

00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:52,520
huge amount and put up with our tendency

00:43:49,579 --> 00:43:55,730
to maybe not respond to emails fast

00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:58,040
enough give no answers or seven

00:43:55,730 --> 00:44:01,190
conflicting answers all the other

00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:03,230
wonderful volunteer things then there
