we've been working with the virtual

00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:09,570
computing lab vcl project for a little

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:18,779
while and that's what I'm going to talk

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:24,269
about so first let me just I'm going to

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:27,810
go over what the VCL is what the VCL can

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:30,570
do and then get into some of the details

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:39,750
about how it works and what's going on

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:43,040
under the hood so in a nutshell the VCL

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:46,469
can do a lot of different things but

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,620
what it primarily does is a lie it gives

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:52,949
it dynamically will provision dedicated

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:56,280
computing environments for a user they

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:59,789
can make a reservation for some sort of

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,100
environment the system will will make

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:05,040
that available to them and and it's

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,180
theirs for for a while when it's when

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,180
they're done with that it goes away

00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:13,500
secondly it brokers access to this so it

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,890
makes sure that certain users can access

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,380
certain types of resources and then it

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:23,340
does all of the orchestration involved

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:26,990
with making sure different different

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,990
pieces of puzzle are in the right places

00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:38,690
this is well it's not limited to

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,850
colleges and universities most of the

00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:44,510
use and certainly the history of the vcl

00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:46,490
is really really focused on its

00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:51,260
implementation at a college or

00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:53,390
university basically you have these

00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:55,100
institutions and they have they have

00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,890
computing resources that they want to

00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,060
make available to students primarily

00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:03,160
this is going to be site license

00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:05,900
software that's expensive potentially

00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:11,890
that they want to have they want to give

00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:15,050
access to to the students so typically

00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:17,780
the way this works is you have a

00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:20,920
computer lab you have a physical room

00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:27,790
with some number of machines this is our

00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:30,290
CS lab at Amherst it has 23 machines so

00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,480
you've got kind of a hard limit on the

00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,550
number of students that they can use

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,780
that very effectively we have another

00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:41,269
another lab a biology lab this has

00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:46,360
software specific for the biological

00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:48,890
sciences chemistry it has 12 computers

00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,440
we have a GIS lab we have eight

00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:56,150
computers again this is these are small

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:59,570
labs this is a small college but that's

00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:01,459
that's what it is and this is this is

00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:03,019
the typical way that colleges and

00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:09,130
universities make these resources

00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:12,560
available it's a little more complicated

00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:16,010
because there are five colleges right in

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,660
our in our Valley and so students at one

00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,940
college will take classes at another

00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:24,350
college and there's the whole system for

00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:26,910
this you know the somme at Holyoke is

00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:29,670
down here hammers

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:32,160
UMass and Smith and Hampshire they're

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:36,240
they're pretty close but it it takes a

00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:39,480
while to get around and if you're if

00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:42,840
you're a student it down here and you're

00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,970
taking a class up here and your class up

00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,190
here requires access to a certain set of

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:50,190
software that's not available at your

00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:56,550
home institution well you're kind of

00:03:50,190 --> 00:04:01,310
stuck there are a number of issues that

00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:04,410
come up aside from just the physical

00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:07,710
distribution of these resources in the

00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:10,800
traditional setting you get you get

00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:14,880
other kinds of issues related to these

00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:17,549
lab environments one is one is putting

00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,739
different versions of the same set of

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:22,650
software on a kind of particular image

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:24,960
so one professor might want this version

00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,460
of matlab and this this person wants

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,400
that version of matlab way you can't

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:34,020
have those on the same image you end up

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:36,630
again with different strange

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,940
combinations this this type of software

00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:41,250
conflicts with that software so again

00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,169
you have to you have to keep some of

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:47,850
these specialized software packages

00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:52,230
separate but these are these are things

00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:54,870
that that conceivably are all very

00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:58,460
solvable especially with some of the

00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:02,280
technologies we have available for

00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:04,230
instance virtualization where you can

00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,880
where we can begin separating these

00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:13,250
images this is one of the main things

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,480
that the VCL makes available can can we

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,640
dynamically provision these these

00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:21,150
environments for for students for

00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:24,150
faculty for any user make them available

00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:27,750
from any location and at any time

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:29,080
because again physical computer computer

00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,099
labs typically have a

00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:36,840
a locked door during certain hours and

00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:39,969
just because of staffing concerns and

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:43,409
and furthermore we need we need a

00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:46,360
self-service interface so students or

00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:49,990
any type of user can access these

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,030
resources him or herself without without

00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,729
meeting to understand network topologies

00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,949
and understand how how any of the

00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:58,389
structure is is really working they just

00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:01,360
want they just want to list of the

00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:04,090
environments that they need to have

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,169
access to and the ability to make a

00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,169
request for that

00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:23,760
so from a user's perspective the way

00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:29,550
this looks is we have a web interface

00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:33,900
and then from that the user simply makes

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:38,040
makes a series of of requests through

00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:40,110
forums and so on and and to them there's

00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,020
just there's just a cloud there's just a

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:46,020
pool of resources to which they'll

00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:49,350
connect this you'll have a series of

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:51,900
nodes which will which will run the

00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:53,190
environments that they that they may

00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,870
have want to have access to you and

00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:58,530
these these nodes can be distributed

00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:00,889
across different posts different

00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:07,860
hypervisor environments different

00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:16,550
physical infrastructures and then in

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:16,550
terms of how this actually works so

00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:26,570
here it is again there are five

00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:28,070
institutions the authentication here is

00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:32,690
fronted with Shibboleth which is a

00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:34,460
federated authentication system so

00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,960
anyone who comes to this is first going

00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:39,260
to have to say okay well which

00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:41,540
institution are you coming from it'll

00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:44,450
send them on to an identity provider

00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:47,950
shibboleth is just a it's an

00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:52,970
implementation of the sam'l security

00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:56,080
markup language we'll see how fast the

00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,080
network is for this but

00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:10,340
so here I am I'm in the virtual

00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,340
computing lab now

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,850
I want to make a new reservation and

00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:23,349
here i have a list of different

00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:27,319
environments that i can choose from

00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:30,800
here's arcgis it has some statistical

00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:32,899
software some GIS software i can

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,510
identify whether i want this reservation

00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:40,240
right now or whether i want to schedule

00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:43,640
this in advance I want it right now and

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:47,660
then at this point this sets off a

00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:50,690
process whereby some some provisioning

00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:53,360
is going to happen this this usually at

00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:56,990
this point it usually takes about 20

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,959
maybe 30 seconds to handle all of all of

00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:03,290
that behind the scenes at which point

00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:10,430
the user is presented with the ability

00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:12,500
to connect in some cases in some cases

00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,820
an image might have to be loaded up from

00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,680
scratch in which case it would take

00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,589
considerably longer the image would have

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:24,350
two foods and such but but here it is

00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:25,930
it's ready we connect to it now it's

00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:30,589
doing it's doing a little bit more

00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:33,170
background orchestration opening up the

00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:37,910
firewall etc this is just going to be a

00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:40,399
windows 7 image and with again with some

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:44,110
special software it's it's at this point

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:49,570
i connect to it over rdp so here we have

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:53,209
we're just standard rdp remote desktop

00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:57,040
there you and I have complete control

00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:57,040
over this image now for the next hour

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:03,160
any if I want to print from this you

00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,649
know again it this is just our DP so

00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:09,170
printing is forwarded over that channel

00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:10,399
any any network disks that I have that

00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:11,930
I've already connected to you are

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,000
forwarded through that channel so I have

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:20,480
access to those inside of this

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:22,640
environment at this point it's just you

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,949
know you've sort of the at this point

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,949
the VCL gets out of the way

00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:33,160
now if your image were a Linux image or

00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:37,150
something you would probably connect

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:48,580
with ssh or some other mechanism and

00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:53,530
that can all be defined that's just a

00:10:48,580 --> 00:11:00,730
default when I so if i go back here to

00:10:53,530 --> 00:11:03,250
my reservations i can extend it to you

00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:06,450
know can make it a little longer when i

00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:11,110
when i originally make the reservation i

00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:14,560
can write here i have a duration i can

00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:19,330
request that it's ten hours or however

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:22,560
long for certain users you can identify

00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:24,880
how long they can make a reservation so

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,980
certain users might be in a group where

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:31,360
oh they can they can make a reservation

00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:33,460
for three months whereas other users you

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,350
might only allow them to make a

00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:37,830
reservation for an hour and then you can

00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:41,320
only extend that up to say four hours

00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:46,230
again that's that's really in terms of

00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:49,980
how you control the resource pools and

00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,980
who has access to what

00:11:51,890 --> 00:12:01,860
yes network access hi cheers so the

00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:05,040
users can do something there the images

00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:08,850
God all of it otherwise yeah it excess

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,990
to whatever so okay so first you're

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,910
raising a good point because these are

00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,520
all non-persistent images and when

00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:19,170
you're done anything that was stored on

00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:23,520
that image is gone so this requires a

00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:25,350
bit of you know so again over over rdp

00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,440
when you are when you're forwarding

00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:31,020
these these network drives typically

00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,880
users will store any data that's

00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:35,300
produced during that session on those

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:42,590
drives that way it persists across

00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:46,500
sessions otherwise you know you can

00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:48,600
potentially have access to you know

00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:53,010
network shares inside of the remote

00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,630
environment it's just a little bit

00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:56,430
complicated because you know again you

00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,840
have in our case we have five different

00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:01,140
institutions and then you have to make

00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:04,170
sure that the firewalls for each of

00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:06,360
those are open in each of those those

00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:09,270
things those are some areas where if

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,280
it's necessary it's entirely doable but

00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:14,370
you would need to define that on an

00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:18,800
image on the image by image basis rather

00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:18,800
than having the VCL manage that for you

00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,050
let's

00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:40,660
so one more thing before we continue so

00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:46,019
this the idea here is that this this

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:50,019
interface is simple and straightforward

00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:52,600
the vcl has has a remote API which

00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:59,339
allows you if you don't like this you

00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:59,339
can you can make your own for example

00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:12,149
you know this is just another interface

00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:15,490
to it this is just a little jquery a

00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:18,730
jquery thing you'll notice my

00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:23,200
reservation is still active if i want to

00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:26,079
make it longer I can if I want to make a

00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,720
new reservation again really easy you

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:32,350
can you can embed this into other

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,540
systems we have this embedded into the

00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:37,060
the course management software so

00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:39,100
students don't even touch the VCL

00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:42,810
website they just make these

00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:45,550
reservations from within the context of

00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:48,670
the course management software connect

00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:51,790
to it and and and they're done they

00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:55,620
don't even they don't even go go go to

00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,620
these this website

00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:07,210
so how this works so first a little bit

00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:10,420
of terminology in the visa in the

00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:12,220
context of the vcl when we say an image

00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:15,910
we're talking about a whole computing

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:17,650
environment this can be just a simple vm

00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:20,770
sort of like what i showed you earlier

00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:22,380
with where you have one operating system

00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:27,480
with some specialized software on it

00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:33,510
this can be a this can be a cluster of

00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:35,890
VMs or physical machines it can be a

00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:39,280
long-running server it can be a lot of

00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:42,160
different things but basically it is an

00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,260
environment it is a specialized sort of

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,510
well-defined environment that has been

00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:51,970
made available to a user a reservation

00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:54,100
users will make a reservation for one of

00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:58,390
these environments again for a lip for a

00:15:54,100 --> 00:16:01,720
certain limited period of time and then

00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:05,320
the resource there there are image

00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:07,170
resources so resources that that define

00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,640
these environments and there are

00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:12,430
computer resources compute resources

00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:18,330
where you know on which these

00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:20,710
environments are arriving so again

00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:22,660
effectively you have these these three

00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:24,640
different groups every every user is

00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:27,760
going to be part of one or more user

00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:30,090
groups every every image is going to be

00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:33,750
part of one or more image groups

00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:36,970
likewise with the actual computers

00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:41,680
within the VCL you have you have

00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:44,620
mappings for how all of these interact

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:48,190
so then so not every user will have

00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:52,360
access to every every image or every

00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:53,920
every physical computer typically you

00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,160
might have a small group of users that

00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:00,990
have access to certain images and other

00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,990
images that are available more widely

00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:10,789
the basic architecture is fairly simple

00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:13,610
you have a web interface you have the

00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:21,309
scheduler the scheduler is basically a

00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:24,079
database what that does is it it

00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:27,409
controls who can make reservations when

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,299
it makes sure that if if your entire

00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:32,179
infrastructure is currently maxed out

00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:34,669
that the next person who comes to make a

00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:38,899
reservation is told well there's nothing

00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:43,909
available now but at 345 you can make a

00:17:38,899 --> 00:17:45,470
reservation the other important thing

00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:48,919
about the scheduler and this is really

00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:53,600
key for academic institutions which is

00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:56,750
that you have classes you have 40 people

00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:00,080
who every tuesday morning at ten need

00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:02,659
access to a particular environment so

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:07,429
you need you need those those nodes

00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:11,480
ready to go at 10am without a whole lot

00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:15,110
of waiting around so it manages all of

00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:17,240
that to the main thing about the web

00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:19,940
interface though is first we're going to

00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,710
handle authentication like I said

00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:26,899
earlier there's there's a Shibboleth

00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:29,240
based authentication built in for those

00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:33,139
of you who attended Oliver Wolf's talked

00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,880
yesterday about authentication in the

00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:37,340
cloud and authorization in the cloud

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,370
it's Shibboleth is basically the same

00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:42,440
kind of thing where you can handle where

00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,779
you can do federated authentication the

00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:49,070
application itself is entirely unaware

00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:51,529
of certain user passwords and it's it's

00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:58,909
considerably more more secure than ldap

00:18:51,529 --> 00:19:01,100
which the vc also supports also the

00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:02,990
system does does all of this access

00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,860
brokering so which users can access

00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,860
which images

00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:13,540
down here again the scheduler we have

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:19,480
that that monitors the state of all of

00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:22,480
these notes is controls and make sure

00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:25,809
that any new reservations can can fit

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:29,380
into the system and be and be available

00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:31,299
when the user is wanting that and it

00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:37,780
also handles and manages these these

00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:41,410
larger block allocations the next tier

00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:44,320
down these these are management nodes

00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:48,340
which you can have one you can have lots

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:51,010
of management notes they can be

00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:56,200
distributed physically however you want

00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:59,290
to do this but these basically listen to

00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,940
the scheduler so when a new request

00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:04,900
comes in one of them will pick up that

00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:07,030
request and then begin processing it the

00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:11,679
this is the layer really where all of

00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:14,140
the orchestration happens these are

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:17,350
going to control they control all of

00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:20,950
your your host infrastructure which

00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:23,860
might be bare metal it might be a some

00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:26,919
type of a vm infrastructure they'll also

00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:29,559
reach into the actual nodes and control

00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:32,620
them and and manage the state of those

00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:34,860
notes making sure that users can can

00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:37,750
access the nodes user accounts

00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:41,140
privileges firewall these types of

00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:44,799
things are all managed by these these

00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:46,559
management nodes the other the other

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:49,630
piece of the management node is

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:53,200
typically all of these will connect as

00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:55,720
well to shared a shared image library so

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,030
you might have certain images that are

00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,890
available here on this host and other

00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:03,070
images that are available on that host

00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:07,150
and at times it might become necessary

00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:09,010
for for images to be moved around and

00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:12,429
made available elsewhere just because of

00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:15,299
changes in the nature of the demand of a

00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:15,299
particular image

00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:27,160
down on this next level again we have we

00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:31,000
have different hosts infrastructure's

00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:37,110
the what what the vcl supports that

00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,110
present is again bare metal provisioning

00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:47,020
VMware various various flavors of VMware

00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:49,690
inversions VirtualBox kvm sort of

00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:54,240
OpenStack there there are some people

00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:56,890
who are using this with OpenStack and

00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,160
better support for that will is

00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:03,490
forthcoming there's certainly been a lot

00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:07,740
of interest in seeing how how the VCL

00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:07,740
could sit on top of CloudStack as well

00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:18,640
so these hosts the way the way they the

00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,140
way they are going to operate again you

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,030
can have one host you can have several

00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:26,620
hosts hanging off of each management

00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:28,450
node those hosts are going to they're

00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:35,290
going to control all of the the running

00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:39,610
nodes and you know in the virtualization

00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:42,040
context what you'll have our master

00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:44,140
golden masters running available on the

00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,690
host which are which are going to be

00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:49,180
persistent in non changing and you'll

00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:52,000
have a series of linked clones running

00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:55,600
on these nodes so that's how that's how

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,830
this non persistence is supported a user

00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:04,680
will access a node nothing will be

00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:07,990
changed against the the master copy and

00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:11,020
you're you know just that the

00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:13,110
non-persistent changes are all are all

00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:15,790
partitioned in and put into a particular

00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:19,080
particular space and then when they're

00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:19,080
done it they're all gone

00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:29,270
the layer at the bottom with these

00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:33,740
computers again for a given image you

00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:35,960
can have one computer one VM one cluster

00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:41,240
however however that ends up being

00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:42,640
defined you can run various the VCL

00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:49,180
supports various operating systems

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:54,010
windows linux high-performance computing

00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:56,870
there are there is a there's a guy at

00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:59,780
foot at Fullerton who basically got this

00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:04,160
to work with OS 10 as well you have to

00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:07,280
run it on OS 10 hardware which has some

00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:12,320
limitations but but it's possible if if

00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:14,690
you really want to do that but again

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,600
these are all these are all going to be

00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:22,640
non-persistent so if something happens

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:24,740
to the vm the user would simply make

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,040
another reservation for the same image

00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:32,570
it would come up and provided that that

00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:37,370
that the data has not been stored on

00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:41,390
that vm nothing will be lost except for

00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:45,980
perhaps some processing and state issues

00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:48,410
some state things so once a reservation

00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:52,850
has been made like what I show you in

00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:54,740
the demo the the web interface will

00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:56,990
provide some information for the user to

00:24:54,740 --> 00:25:00,920
connect directly to this this computer

00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:05,059
out over rdp over ssh however it's

00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:06,620
defined for the image they'll have

00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:08,750
access to it for that period of time

00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,550
when that time expires and they'll

00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:13,820
they'll be notified once they're getting

00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:17,570
close to do such things as save their

00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:20,510
work and or or extend their reservation

00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:25,059
which which are both possible but once

00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:28,130
once they're done the compute node is

00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:29,330
effectively destroyed and it's returned

00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:31,440
to the pool

00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:34,530
now if you make a reservation for

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,810
something and you never connect well or

00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:38,730
or you connect and then you disconnect

00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:42,480
in your idle for a certain period of

00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:44,720
time that too will cause cause that that

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,000
compute note to be returned to the pool

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:51,210
basically the idea is that if you're not

00:25:48,000 --> 00:26:00,060
using these resources they'll just go

00:25:51,210 --> 00:26:06,450
back into the pool so using these linked

00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:10,410
clones is is really nice for for user

00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:13,080
access but when it comes to updating

00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:16,260
your image adding software to a

00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:18,500
particular image or otherwise making

00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:21,270
changes to your image environment then

00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:27,450
what happens with that and how do you do

00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:29,070
that the way the VCL the way the VCL

00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:31,350
operates with that is when you when you

00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:33,750
initially set set up this this

00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:37,260
environment there will be a series of

00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:38,700
base images and by base image what what

00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,670
that means is you might have a Linux

00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:44,280
image with nothing particularly special

00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:46,830
with it then there might be a Windows 7

00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:50,160
image again no no applications are

00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:52,200
installed it's just windows 7 maybe

00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,690
you're running XP as well so you have a

00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:58,890
series of images with with nothing on

00:26:54,690 --> 00:27:02,520
them effectively when when someone wants

00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:04,830
to create a new image something that

00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,770
would that would actually be used in in

00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:11,670
the context of the VCL by by a student

00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:13,860
or a faculty member what happens is you

00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:16,650
you create an imaging reservation so

00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:20,430
then rather than reserving a linked

00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:24,660
clone you you you do a full clone of

00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:26,880
this virtual machine the users then

00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,830
given access to that full clone you make

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,240
whatever changes you want you might you

00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:34,680
might need to install say MATLAB are

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,640
whatever whatever the software it is

00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:39,840
that you that you need to install and

00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:43,789
when you're done

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:47,010
you go back to this web interface and

00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:52,350
you click a button and that kicks off a

00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:54,090
process by which the image is sort of

00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:57,330
there there some there's some cleaning

00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:59,010
that takes place for instance with with

00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:01,350
Windows you're going to defragment the

00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:06,330
hard drive you're going to clean out

00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:07,950
some temporary files there are different

00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:11,039
up there are different operating system

00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:15,299
modules defined in the VCL that handle

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:18,720
different os's differently once once

00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:23,010
that cleaning process has completed the

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:26,450
OS has shut down and then and then your

00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:29,250
host your your hypervisor is going to

00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:30,779
have to define you know some process by

00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,840
which your copy you're going to copy the

00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:36,630
virtual disk into this area of golden

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:39,270
golden master or virtual disks and at

00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:43,640
that point your image becomes available

00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:46,890
or your image becomes in this pool of

00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:49,409
images you can there there's some

00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:52,919
there's some workflow that that has been

00:28:49,409 --> 00:28:54,899
defined so the user who's created that

00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:57,990
image can then go through and test it

00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:59,640
and verify it and once they define once

00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:02,039
they say that it's it's ready for

00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,950
production they can define that in the

00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:10,100
context of the application and then at

00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:10,100
that point users can access the image

00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:27,510
we in our use of the VCL we've you know

00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:31,350
again Amherst College is is it's a small

00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:35,970
place but we've so our infrastructure

00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:37,770
isn't huge for this but what we have

00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:42,810
what we have been doing is we've looked

00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:44,880
at how this performs under load with

00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:48,210
certain spikes because again with the

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:51,150
VCL you're going to have kind of a low

00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:53,370
load of these ad hoc reservations where

00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:55,410
someone who just like I did earlier

00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:59,280
comes along says I'd like a reservation

00:29:55,410 --> 00:30:04,350
right now it loads up that the load from

00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:06,840
that tends to be consistently low and

00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:08,550
this is you know just for it for our our

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:12,080
experience and then you'll have these

00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:14,400
courses where you need a larger pool of

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:18,410
images available all at one particular

00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,410
time where you have a sudden spike and

00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:26,520
your infrastructure needs to be able to

00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:29,730
handle that what I found is that the i/o

00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:36,180
latency was really the the bottleneck

00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:40,440
that we ran into initially 4v within the

00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:42,690
context of VMware we had we had all of

00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:46,980
our golden masters on on one datastore

00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:49,500
and then we had all of the the workspace

00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:53,190
where new images are being spun up all

00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:55,620
on a different data store once we put

00:30:53,190 --> 00:31:00,270
that workspace data store on faster

00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:04,380
disks all of the all of the issues with

00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:07,310
IO agency just dropped and and at that

00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:10,230
point what we found is we could begin

00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:15,000
over subscribing member on memory and on

00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:18,240
on cpu so our infrastructure

00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,980
you know I i I'm over subscribing Ram by

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:25,170
about twenty percent now which which

00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:27,660
allows me to have more machines

00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:32,130
available you know then I would

00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:36,480
otherwise anticipate we have everything

00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:40,640
running in in a vcenter cluster so you

00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:44,130
know this this requires the the vmware

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:47,940
enterprise license but vmware then can

00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:50,940
can do do some load balancing so certain

00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:54,240
VMS that are that are running rather hot

00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:56,130
can be moved around according to you

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,580
know across different physical hosts

00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:02,780
according to what makes the most sense

00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,780
for particular processors

00:32:08,609 --> 00:32:17,559
so the VCL last summer we we graduated

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:22,419
from the incubator into a top-level

00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:25,149
project and there are a number of a

00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:27,460
number of people around the country who

00:32:25,149 --> 00:32:29,830
are using this in production right now

00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:32,230
there are there are a couple of

00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:35,309
directions that were were specifically

00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:40,509
specifically looking at in the future

00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:44,350
one is one is being able to to pop into

00:32:40,509 --> 00:32:48,700
ec2 so that once if your infrastructure

00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:52,149
gets becomes overtaxed you would be able

00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:55,899
to provision a new a new vm or a new a

00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:57,879
new environment inside of the amazon

00:32:55,899 --> 00:33:01,119
cloud for example there's been a little

00:32:57,879 --> 00:33:04,029
bit of work in this direction we're

00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:07,379
looking to do more there there there's

00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:11,730
an existing user base for OpenStack and

00:33:07,379 --> 00:33:14,019
we're looking to bring that into trunk

00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:18,480
we also want to make make it possible

00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:22,289
for user for end-users to provision a

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:25,840
full VMware infrastructure so that the

00:33:22,289 --> 00:33:29,470
ESX operating system can can be made

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:33,039
available to an end user that isn't so

00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:36,220
much very urgent in the context of

00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:39,399
amherst college but certainly at North

00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:41,409
Carolina State where where the history

00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:43,450
of this development is has started

00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:49,330
there's a lot of interest in that in

00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:52,419
that direction a policy-based broker

00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:55,739
tool by this I mean defining defining

00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:57,759
images in terms of RDF and then you can

00:33:55,739 --> 00:34:01,149
from what I showed you when you have a

00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:03,249
list of 10 10 images or so a user is

00:34:01,149 --> 00:34:05,619
going to have no problem figuring out

00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:07,760
which one they want access to but if you

00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:11,840
have a hundred images that you want to

00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:15,620
look through and decide decide or pick

00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:17,899
one out from from a long list something

00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:21,500
a little more nuanced where you can you

00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:24,560
can search and constrain your options

00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:29,000
might be fairly handy and this this will

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:31,550
involve just publishing publishing image

00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,899
metadata in rdf and then you can use

00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:40,370
some type of a sparkle type service

00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:44,090
maybe Apache Jenna or some such Triple

00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:48,200
store to manage to manage that and then

00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:56,210
finally managing power inside of vmware

00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:59,560
vm infrastructure we'll see so are there

00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:59,560
any questions yes

00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:08,210
the only reason we're we're focused on

00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,040
OpenStack is because there are some

00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:13,090
people who are using OpenStack and they

00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:17,240
they've written some modules for that I

00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:21,140
think that that that building in an

00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:23,360
interaction with cloud sac would be

00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:26,300
would be great fabulous we would just

00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:30,010
need to find some people who are

00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,010
dedicated to doing that

00:35:42,049 --> 00:35:54,680
it's written in PHP with JavaScript it's

00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:59,160
so it just connects to a database an

00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:02,849
earlier version supported Derby I the

00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:05,940
present version requires my sequel but

00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:09,270
the actual database technology isn't

00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:13,099
particularly important but and that runs

00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:13,099
all on the the Apache web server

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:35,450
for for particular images typically the

00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:40,490
the owner of a particular image is going

00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:42,980
to define Ram networks you know minimum

00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:45,500
network speed different things that

00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:49,730
relate to a specific image the user

00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:51,800
isn't going to have control over how

00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:53,990
much how many research or how the type

00:36:51,800 --> 00:37:04,490
of resources allocated to a given image

00:36:53,990 --> 00:37:06,820
but the creator of an image does they

00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,820
are

00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:22,980
those those are provided to the end user

00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:27,109
in that in that they're given a title

00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:30,390
and a description of a given environment

00:37:27,109 --> 00:37:32,369
where i was describing this this rdf

00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:34,640
based brokering tool that would have

00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:39,299
this that would have the metadata of

00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:42,089
image side you know disk size ram etc

00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:47,339
etc where a user would be able to choose

00:37:42,089 --> 00:37:50,640
that are you dealing with network

00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:54,299
isolation for your end users I any of

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:57,630
student 122 the provision of Windows

00:37:54,299 --> 00:38:04,049
p.m. those are they the same problem has

00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:06,690
domain so they so each each VM has a

00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:11,930
public and a private network interface

00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:11,930
to the vcl the the private interface

00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:18,539
they're really not going to be able to

00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:19,650
access that that's going to that's going

00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:23,819
to be an interface between the

00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:25,609
management notes so between the

00:38:23,819 --> 00:38:30,210
management nodes and these compute nodes

00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:32,339
a user on this node is not going to be

00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:36,240
able to access a user over here on this

00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:37,710
node but if they're on the thing they

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:42,829
wouldn't be on the same node because

00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:45,680
each each node is dedicated oh sorry I

00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:51,470
all right so I was born

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:54,230
he was actually hypervisor yeah so yeah

00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:57,170
so you know user one might be here

00:38:54,230 --> 00:39:00,740
another user would be here you're never

00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:05,560
going to have multiple users on the same

00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:18,320
note you can have them on the same host

00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:23,150
yeah so that is a good question I don't

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:28,460
know can I run video on then one and see

00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:32,330
the traffic that's passing out free I

00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:36,470
don't think so but i don't know i would

00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:39,080
need i would check but you're not

00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:42,610
passing you're not passing anything

00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:45,790
about users down to the underlying

00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:49,370
hypervisor or about management platform

00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:51,850
now for all of this it's a single user

00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:56,000
with making all the provision West

00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:57,920
so there there's a there's an internal

00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,090
user that's going to be making those

00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:05,240
requests the user who connects is is

00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:09,320
going to be provisioned you know in an

00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:11,120
ad hoc way so there that's created I'm

00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:13,370
talking about all the hypervisor as far

00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:18,100
as the hydrologic you turn there's

00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:20,810
always a single a user / making yes yes

00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:29,950
how do you make sure that I don't have

00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:29,950
that your article session we don't

00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:49,869
I'm guessing you're assuming a little

00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:53,510
right are you typically are Europeans

00:40:49,869 --> 00:40:59,690
authenticating against LDAP or Active

00:40:53,510 --> 00:41:04,790
Directory or the VMS are not provision

00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:07,070
this type of machine we are we're

00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:09,830
provisioning a machine and then we are

00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:11,930
just randomly assigning it a password

00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:15,410
the password is valid only for that

00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:18,740
session so it's not touching any network

00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:22,540
services you know where your where

00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:22,540
you'll be sending user user information

00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,830
the same location five

00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:45,030
even if it goes together don't move or a

00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:46,860
net put a photo bomb so the way yeah I

00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:49,170
mean the way we have our our system

00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:53,240
setup is we have we have basically two

00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:55,380
sets of infant we have two major

00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:57,180
management notes you know it different

00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:59,700
across a couple of different you know

00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:06,210
two different campuses and then each of

00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:08,310
these controls a series of nodes so we

00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:10,530
need know within a given infrastructure

00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:14,010
would would you know sort of reside

00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:18,240
within that if you were going to be

00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:21,120
doing a cluster reservation it would it

00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:27,720
would pull nodes that were all within a

00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:30,900
given unit so I know when the end of

00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:33,660
West customs went into the same right

00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:36,840
approach when it comes to women was to

00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:40,070
all fighting mr. license problems how to

00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:43,830
solve inspector Latin Microsoft

00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:48,330
mix this around um dad has so the

00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:52,590
licensing issues are huge you have to so

00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:54,270
basically the way it works is if you

00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:58,590
have a it's sort of assuming that you

00:42:54,270 --> 00:43:03,240
have a site license you can you can have

00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:05,250
a mac key which would be a single key

00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:08,940
that's then defined inside of the VCL

00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:11,190
for a given a given institution so every

00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:13,620
time that Windows machine is brought up

00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:16,350
it will be validated against that key or

00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:18,090
you might have a KMS server which is

00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:20,880
which would be a network server against

00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:24,360
which you're activating so then whenever

00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:27,210
the note is brought up it would if you

00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:29,720
know that that node is part of this

00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:34,740
institution you would query that

00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:36,360
institutions KMS server it validates if

00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:39,420
it doesn't validate then you have an

00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:43,200
inactive key and then doesn't really

00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:46,950
work so you have to have you have to

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:52,830
have some mechanism for you know 40 s

00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:55,980
licensing typically typically campuses

00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:59,280
have some sort of a hosts you know site

00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:00,960
a site license for windows and and

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,710
there's some type of infrastructure for

00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,710
that in place

00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:24,850
anyway thank you yes there's nothing

00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:27,310
Billy in charge the difference no and

00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:29,080
that's that's that's the part so if we

00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:31,660
were to do you know when we get to the

00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:35,440
point where we were doing this is

00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:39,310
popping atoms into ec2 that there has to

00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:42,460
be some some way of managing Billy or

00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:43,720
some type of I mean you know I mean

00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:45,790
there's a lot of statistics that are

00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:48,310
taps and you can look through these

00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:52,270
statistics and find out our the usage

00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:53,650
inside my body but that's that's not so

00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:56,100
well defined that you could use it for

00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:56,100
building

00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:06,619
