all right I think we can get started

00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,779
thanks for coming to the session my name

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,360
is Don harbison i'm on the apache

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:11,190
openoffice project management committee

00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,950
a little bit about a little bit about

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,830
myself i joined the open house community

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,230
in 2005 when it was on his sons

00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:21,000
leadership great time going to their

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,060
conferences in places like slovenia and

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,910
Barcelona and orvieto and Italy and so

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,099
forth various interesting university

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:33,570
towns across Europe that was the

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:36,350
community at the time and as an IBM

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,940
employee is my other hat we brought

00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:40,649
technology from openoffice into IBM and

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,010
built a product called IBM symphony and

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:47,120
derived from open office technology so I

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,559
had a role in that in that stage as well

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,600
but i'm here to talk about apache

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,670
openoffice and how we've gotten two

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,610
today so i wanted to talk a bit about

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,340
what i see is the opportunities in the

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,710
market you know really symbolized by the

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,890
entry of apache openoffice as a

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,540
top-level project here i want to go

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,210
through some timelines stuff for you

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,590
just so you have chronology that the

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,290
timeline of what we've been through for

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,760
the last 18 months in particular I don't

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,250
think I want to bore you with the deep

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,229
history of a star division in the 1990s

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,000
and Sons acquisition in two thousand and

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:24,210
the creation of the open source open

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,340
office or community 2000 but it's been a

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,070
long journey for many of us and really

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,409
excited to see the product now at Apache

00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:33,210
I want to talk about the people and the

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,060
nature of the project today so what

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,259
we've done it Apache in particular and

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,600
then I'm going to kind of you know

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,450
digress a bit on to this topic of

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,520
document file formats in particular ODF

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,549
but i'll touch on microsoft's open xml

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,630
as well and what that signifies in the

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,840
industry and what that means for

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,430
openoffice in our user community and

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,229
then really get into the sort of the

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,930
details of what we're working on now our

00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,759
current work plan and and the outlook

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,740
for the future what we're planning to

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,079
build on on apache openoffice going

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,530
forward our are for dot 0 planning and

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,170
what we're doing with extensions so just

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,599
a bit about opportunities we really have

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,270
sort of three skiers who I'm talking

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,460
about the market

00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,850
opportunity the community opportunity in

00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:21,400
our approach just from a pure market

00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:23,200
opportunity of viewpoint as a premier

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,780
open office as a premier office

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,250
productivity suite as an alternative to

00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,010
microsoft office we have an opportunity

00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,780
to really drive commoditization but more

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,390
importantly innovation in the space

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,610
around office productivity if you think

00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:39,100
about microsoft office put print in the

00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:41,650
marketplace for better part of 20 years

00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,470
it's been a monoculture and pretty much

00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,090
under the control of one company now at

00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,760
apache we have open office and we have

00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,990
many different ideas coming together on

00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,210
the project is really a great

00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:55,360
opportunity to innovate and take open

00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:56,380
offices in New new areas but to do that

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,780
we're going to have to build a healthy

00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,490
and vibrant project and it's going to

00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,760
serve the interests of the marketplace

00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:07,570
in many diverse ways you know a market

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,080
that demands Joyce and openness so it's

00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:12,070
a challenge for all of us in the project

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,470
we need to promote open office

00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:16,690
extensions one of the easiest ways to

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,820
customize open office for a fit for

00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,290
purpose is to build extensions i'll be

00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,290
talking about that in the course of the

00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:25,660
talk over on the community opportunity

00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,610
side you know we still have this

00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,680
objective to continue to build open

00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,750
office as a premier alternative to

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,280
microsoft office to be seen as a brand

00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:37,720
that is recognized around the world as

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,030
office productivity suite that is open

00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,430
source freely available for download and

00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,500
use that mitigates the need to purchase

00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,560
of commercial product like microsoft

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:51,340
office and yet delivers you value and

00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,830
the chance to get your documents done in

00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,930
a very quick and easy way and many times

00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,580
in your own native language native

00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,390
language support is a really key focus

00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,260
for us so therefore we kind of see the

00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:05,020
intersection of public sector and

00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,209
private sector is a sweet spot for the

00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,760
opportunity to build community we saw

00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:13,709
this early with open office in in the

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,299
first decade of the century 2000-2010

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,919
where public sector was very quick to

00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:21,489
understand the value of this this

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,890
opportunity to drive out to really make

00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:25,720
a more innovative office document on a

00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,410
tool available to their public service

00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,370
workers

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:32,050
but big business caught on as well and

00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:35,260
we saw many companies using Microsoft

00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:36,640
using openoffice as a way to negotiate a

00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,200
better deal with microsoft office at

00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,600
lease on price and in some cases

00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,470
actually adopt open office so all these

00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,370
things have been in play in the market

00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,320
so our approach here is really to

00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,900
establish apache and now that we've made

00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,830
the transition as our major development

00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,230
community for all this productivity

00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:56,440
software we're a different project if

00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:59,740
you look across the 100-plus TLPs in the

00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:02,110
foundation we stick out as the largest

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,510
end user oriented suffer a project in

00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,940
Apache something that the foundation

00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,770
membership and and the board really

00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:13,720
thought long and hard about when we

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:14,770
began incubation in June of 2011 we need

00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,140
to grow the open document format

00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,880
ecosystem around open office arguably

00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,210
open office is the reference

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,950
implementation for the ODF file format

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,200
ODF itself was developed by sun

00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:29,170
microsystems and made a contribution to

00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:32,320
the open standards world early in 2001 I

00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:34,330
believe at oasis so we're all about

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,910
continued to focus on improvements in

00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:39,780
ODF and building your deep echo system

00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:43,120
based on our open office applications

00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:45,190
last point here is we had a fork in

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,470
OpenOffice that preceded the Apache

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,000
project actually the Libre Office forked

00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:52,290
many of you heard about Libre Office I'm

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,120
sure split off from the OpenOffice trunk

00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:57,040
actually as early as 2007 under the

00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,220
leadership of nevell in a project called

00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,530
go oo org and then later on in September

00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:05,710
2010 following the conference in

00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:07,570
Budapest this group's put off and

00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,600
created the LibreOffice project we

00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:12,430
brought org they have a GPL sensibility

00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,470
about licensing we have a patchy

00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,660
licensing accessibility so there's just

00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:18,220
differences about licensing and ideology

00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,830
in that respect but there's a lot of

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:23,740
common passion about the respective

00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:25,510
communities and the overlap a lot so

00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,520
costly looking for areas week where we

00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:30,040
could reach out and cooperate with those

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,650
guys and do common work items together

00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,710
and it's an ongoing process to have that

00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,760
happen

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,680
so just a bit about the product itself

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:41,580
just how many of you are using open

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,930
office today much year so anybody i'm

00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,050
familiar with open office in particular

00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:49,199
i can skip this chart thing i just want

00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:52,320
to briefly mention it is six apps under

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,810
the suite and obviously we're processing

00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,860
with a writer app the impressed present

00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,479
presentation tool in the calc

00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,979
spreadsheet are the dominant

00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:00,780
applications but we have a great drawing

00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:04,380
tool and we're improving that a good

00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:06,690
application environment with basic and a

00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:09,419
mathematical formula editor as well for

00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:11,220
on particular academic environments all

00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:15,210
this now has made it under the AL to

00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:18,680
license in our first release we made a

00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:22,350
second release in in august 2 2011 2012

00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:27,720
and we're now on path to our for release

00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:30,150
in mid-2013 platform support windows XP

00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,979
windows 7 windows 8 interesting footnote

00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:35,669
on Windows 8 Microsoft actually came to

00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:39,030
us early and really so solicited us to

00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:42,030
put support in for Windows 8 that's part

00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:45,060
of the early adopter program so we did

00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:49,010
that and that's now in the platform

00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:54,050
support list here linux 32 64 bit

00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:56,580
packages for our WN as well mac OS

00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:58,650
translations local language support very

00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,870
very big focus for us one of the

00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:03,090
missions we have at apache this building

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:05,030
software for the public good and in a

00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,830
very real sense very tangible way

00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,389
openoffice does exactly do that for many

00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,520
people in many countries whose language

00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:14,849
is not supported by commercial office

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,940
productivity we've had combined in

00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:21,060
cambodia all 11 dialects of various

00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:25,680
ethnic groups in South Africa recently

00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:27,389
added Gaelic styrian in Spain and just

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,400
last week we had somebody pop up from

00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:31,830
the Arctic Circle an intuitive Eskimo

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,900
who's working on doing some language

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:37,349
preservation projects using openoffice a

00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,580
very very exciting kind of area the

00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:39,820
project that I really think is an

00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:45,640
important dot ones

00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:48,310
not forget about open ops has a pretty

00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:51,610
small footprint in sits on about 80 mix

00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:55,000
on your desk maybe 170 it starts up

00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:57,910
pretty quickly the interoperability

00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,040
focus here is I can't overestimate this

00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:03,010
this is a real gotcha in terms of

00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,360
pragmatic use in business where everyone

00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,310
is surrounded by oceans notions of

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,510
Microsoft Office file formats either the

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:10,720
Microsoft binaries of the newer

00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:12,820
Microsoft XML file formats so in our

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,710
abilities is ongoing focus for us and

00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,660
one with their continued to put a lot of

00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:19,510
effort into last but not least

00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,010
accessibility support this is an item

00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,570
that is very very important in

00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,200
particular the United States and some

00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:27,430
other European countries where by law

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,730
companies must provide support for the

00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:33,190
disabled persons in particular

00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:35,620
individuals who lack site so we're

00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:38,710
building that into apache openoffice 40

00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:41,620
this year so here's the timeline for

00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:43,690
last 18 months the the journey really

00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,910
began when Oracle decided to exit the

00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:48,610
business in april two thousand two

00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:50,920
thousand eleven and made the donation of

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,510
source code and signed all the paperwork

00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:56,230
and create the incubation proposal in

00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:57,670
june IBM joined shortly thereafter and

00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:00,280
made the decision to end our symphony

00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:03,010
fork so mentioned earlier i was part of

00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:06,610
the team that brought you know IBM to

00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:08,440
the openoffice.org community in 2007 we

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,300
had a private life we IBM had a private

00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,070
license agreement at that time to build

00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,870
the symphony product but it really was

00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,510
not the preferred strat we never really

00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:18,850
wanted to do that we wanted to work

00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,930
directly in the community but IBM and a

00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,110
lot of our enterprise customers just

00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:25,890
have a problem with canoe licensing so

00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:28,360
we needed to have a more liberal license

00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,890
so we had that now at apache we joined

00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,710
we announced that we were going to end

00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:35,680
the symphony fork and that was that was

00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:37,570
communicated in july of 2011 then the

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,660
project team really dug in in serious

00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:43,330
mode in october once the the project

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,640
community BM stabilized and play on the

00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,350
the initial food out for release based

00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,510
on the sources from oracle that we're

00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,690
now sitting in a passion

00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:54,210
version thanks to Angie Risto here who

00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,650
did a lot of yeoman's work we wouldn't

00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,750
have openoffice with Andrews support an

00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:00,540
amazing effort to bring that source in

00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:03,300
and work with us on the IP clearance to

00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,800
get it as an Apache release so if any of

00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,650
you've been working in Apache projects

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,460
in patch release you know how

00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:11,760
detail-oriented the legal requirements

00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:15,060
are for IP we had over 10 million lines

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,620
of code we had to scan and we discovered

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,630
lots of libraries that did indeed need

00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,180
to be deprecated and replaced with

00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:24,240
alternatives that we did indeed find

00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:27,960
from open source libraries elsewhere so

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,120
by may of 2011 2012 excuse me we had a

00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,880
first official Apache release come out

00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,530
the three-dot for release we were able

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,630
also to add some new features in the

00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:38,490
graphics area one of our our star

00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:41,130
programmers that from the form of Sun

00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:43,590
lab Oracle lab in Hamburg Germany an

00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:45,330
excellent expert in SVG graphics did

00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:48,690
some really cool new things and graphics

00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:50,490
then made it into 304 and that's when we

00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:53,820
started to sort of see the the uptick in

00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:56,010
in demand because of the the updated

00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,990
technology and openoffice that sort of

00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:59,820
made it have made users aware that there

00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,850
was a new version available Dallas

00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:05,850
started to take off we followed up with

00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:08,490
a 3 dot for one release in August more

00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:11,370
bug fixes we had completed the symphony

00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:13,680
source code contribution into svn and I

00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:15,570
another onerous process at IBM to scrub

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,310
the source make sure there wasn't

00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,650
anything company confidential and those

00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:23,730
source files and then push it into ssbn

00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:26,040
as a branch at apache openoffice we had

00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:30,900
a long discussion as to how to proceed

00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:33,150
to go forward in the community 11 model

00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,950
was to build open all this future on

00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:37,170
open office and then to emerge Tiffany

00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:40,080
value on top of that and the other model

00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:42,150
is the opposite build open office on

00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,030
symphony platform and emerged openoffice

00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:47,460
value on that because of the history and

00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:49,740
the the value of the larger amount of

00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:52,350
code sitting in child workspaces from

00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:54,480
Sonora chol and the need to preserve

00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,250
that community and grow it we are

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,680
for the former build the future of

00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,050
openoffice on the Open Office 34 base

00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:04,220
adding in sympathy value incrementally

00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:07,170
which is going to take longer to do but

00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:11,940
what was a really was the consensus of

00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:15,870
the community so that was August 2012 by

00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:18,389
October we graduated and I see Joe from

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,740
infra here and one of our our mentors on

00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:21,959
the project it was an interesting

00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,399
process to get to graduation in the

00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:26,220
community a lot of strong personalities

00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:29,760
a a lot of learning of the Apache way a

00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:31,290
lot of thought of you know just you know

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,550
so the qualitative aspects of building

00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,930
healthy community were probably the most

00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:36,120
challenging things we had to accomplish

00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:38,339
in order to qualify for graduation and

00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,690
take that ballot forward so I'm pretty

00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:41,940
pleased and proud that we did achieve

00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:45,480
that that's a major milestone to become

00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:47,820
a TLP here at the foundation so by

00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,730
November we were deep into the 40

00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,949
planning I personally got involved in

00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,630
putting together the ACE the Apache

00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:56,810
conference in Europe and since I'm in

00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:59,010
terms of the programming grid

00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:01,100
unfortunately I person was not able to

00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:03,449
attend due to a family emergency but I

00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,339
was excited to see that come together

00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:09,149
with with our open office team having a

00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:10,709
major track there it's no secret I think

00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:12,120
amongst all of you hear that the open

00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:14,579
avacs community is predominant based in

00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,220
in Europe so I'm patchy Conan and

00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:21,000
Northwest of the u.s. is seeing a thin

00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:23,850
level participation worldwide downloads

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,380
by februari or cresting around 38

00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:28,130
million and I think it's at this week I

00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:30,329
can say clothed you have a 40 million

00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:31,860
download number it's actually

00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:34,199
conservative if you want to look at some

00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,720
of the other sites but we do some wire

00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:39,029
in Google Analytics on to our download

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,670
site and we're pretty confident that

00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:43,350
number is solid so it's a pretty

00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:46,079
stunning number about a million

00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,459
downloads a week so if things keep

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,410
tracking this way we'll probably 80

00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:51,329
million or so downloads by the end of

00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:56,010
the year and how two million or so by

00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:58,260
this time next year a lot of users we

00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:01,410
have a stats project down here

00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,819
openoffice org stats some Python scripts

00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,709
that are wired in thanks to sourceforge

00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:06,320
now you can go there and take a look in

00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:08,930
detail to see that the download

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,860
counts and our committer stats and some

00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:14,930
other interesting data also one of the

00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:17,180
oracle did with ace not only did they

00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:18,440
grant their software source code to

00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,870
effector the foundation but they also

00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,570
transferred the trademarks for

00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:25,400
openoffice.org to the foundation the

00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:27,920
openoffice.org website itself gets three

00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,810
quarters of a million hits a day so

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,720
another really really high traffic site

00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:34,010
that and it symbolizes the kind of huge

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,610
interest we have in this project from

00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:40,010
end user community what it'll talk about

00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:44,930
the community now is it's really

00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:46,490
veterans and newbies both you know these

00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:49,280
these are actually in the file that i

00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,780
transfer that i'm not sure where the the

00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:54,620
presentation vals end up but there are

00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:57,650
links in here and i'll just go over here

00:15:54,620 --> 00:16:01,130
and show you that we do have this

00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:03,620
directory volunteers we have you know

00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:06,110
alfabeto sized all the people that

00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,300
involved in the project by by name by

00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:10,700
location by area of interest what

00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,020
they're interested in doing so we

00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,210
maintain this this this list is

00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:18,140
constantly growing for a volunteer

00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:19,490
directory we have I think I'll sure what

00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:23,480
the exact count of this directory is

00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:28,760
this point but it doesn't d growing in

00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:32,360
terms of the other aspects here the size

00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:35,060
of the community we have you know this

00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:38,870
particular page on our wiki which talks

00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:41,750
about our user groups I mentioned the

00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:43,400
stat page some initiative factoids we

00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,440
have an announced list that we have over

00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,450
9000 foreign people subscribe to our

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,880
announcement list so individuals that

00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:54,110
opted in to hear about news from our

00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:56,210
project on a forums we have over 55,000

00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:58,280
people active in our forums I'm

00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,890
subscribing this is where we have our

00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,720
self-service support for end users

00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:04,490
coming together in various languages

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,199
Twitter over a thousand followers

00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,900
Facebook of almost four thousand

00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:10,310
followers Google+ over 2,000 so we

00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,230
really are building community using

00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,820
social media in the project and it's

00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:18,650
quite exciting to see that

00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:20,030
and thrive in terms of business one of

00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,800
the interesting attributes of the Apache

00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:23,720
licensing of course is its permissive

00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,030
nature there's nothing that says anyone

00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,180
cannot you wrap a business around an

00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:31,190
Apache License project or software so we

00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,950
hope to see more consultants and signing

00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:35,660
on to our consultants directory offering

00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:39,620
programming services customization

00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:42,620
training a whole variety of service and

00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,940
support offering should be made

00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,880
available on that directory and this

00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:49,670
will help get these folks and as

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:53,600
individuals or small companies some some

00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:55,610
real business commercial action in the

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,770
extension space we have over 300

00:17:55,610 --> 00:18:00,380
extensions offers who built over 700

00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:03,050
extensions and these extensions since

00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,330
they're not licensed consistently under

00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:06,950
say the Apache governance we were very

00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:09,170
fortunate to have sourceforge offer to

00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:11,480
host these for us and I'll talk a bit

00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:14,240
about that and a little further into

00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,220
presentation but the extensions are

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,670
available in volume in there they do a

00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:21,680
lot of really cool things we have

00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:23,870
authors that have written books on open

00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,460
office in the past we're currently in

00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,680
the process of having a call for

00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:29,240
documentation specialists as we're

00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,520
ramping into the 40 plan we're going to

00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,190
need doc writers to step up and

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:39,470
volunteer to write new doc for

00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:41,150
openoffice 40 interesting we do count

00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:42,830
our libre office colleagues as part of

00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:44,900
our community they they have recently

00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:47,300
rebased lee bravas 40 on the apache

00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,940
openoffice source code so is this quite

00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,350
flattering that they chose to do that

00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,210
we're pleased again to serve the public

00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:55,760
good by offering our source under the

00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:58,220
apache licensing they chose to relicense

00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,560
under the mozilla public license again

00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:04,070
sort of an ideological position around

00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,450
licensing shows its face but we're

00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:08,840
pleased that they are indeed taking

00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:10,400
advantage of our source I've talked

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,660
about the directory volunteers Connacht

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:17,750
26 names on that list you know we have

00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:20,390
our mailing list 400 dev which is really

00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:23,300
this large sprawling primary dead list

00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:24,770
email has over four and 42 people

00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,840
subscribe to it currently and that's our

00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:29,590
main development

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:32,710
mailing list we do our bug reporting we

00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:34,299
have giran bugzilla going on we have 55

00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:36,880
translators active and project for

00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:38,110
localization we have a dedicated team is

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,299
really zeroed in on the website

00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:43,179
infrastructure the heavily trafficked

00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:45,909
openoffice org site continuing to make

00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:47,830
improvements there so just an awful lot

00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:50,529
of stuff going on this project it really

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,750
is a broad and a deep project and

00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:54,250
there's many where's many areas where if

00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,440
you're interested to get involved you

00:19:54,250 --> 00:20:00,159
can really is more enough more than

00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,779
enough work to go around here committers

00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:04,890
right now just a key thing there we've

00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:07,149
had 122 committers in the project we

00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:09,549
went through a phase where it kind of

00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:11,860
flattened out around 90 committers and

00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:13,840
then it spiked up 222 is kind of holding

00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:16,960
steady at that level we think that's a

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:21,700
healthy amount and so we're pleased with

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:24,490
that growth as well and ok back to this

00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,529
so yeah the get involved page we in

00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:29,919
terms of how we appeal to grow in the

00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:31,409
community we really want people to know

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,350
how they can get involved in a project

00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:37,059
so again on our website here this is the

00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:39,130
the actual openoffice our report website

00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:41,080
where we have this get involved page so

00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,580
when we have a call for volunteers as we

00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,279
just had this week for documentation

00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,990
specialist somebody will raise their

00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,820
hand on list and say I'm really

00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:51,039
interested in getting started what do I

00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,299
do well typically direct them over to

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:55,029
this page just to give them an

00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:56,830
orientation about the project you know

00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:59,020
where you can get started and things

00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:01,000
like that and there are other Peyton

00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,799
here we introduce the mailing lists and

00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,870
new volunteer orientation modules that

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,520
we've written and so we really are

00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:09,429
trying to build the tools and sort of

00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,840
the you know much more sort of

00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:12,940
self-evident way to get started even

00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:16,240
though it is a very complex and ND

00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:17,919
project and difficult to navigate we're

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:22,000
trying to address that problem and make

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:23,830
it easier as I said there are many roles

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,140
and I think you just saw those scrolling

00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:28,779
by from coder to documentation

00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:31,570
specialist to QA the translation into

00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:32,710
our kitang to web infrastructure so

00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:34,390
there are these different disciplines

00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:36,540
within the probably do need volunteer

00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:38,440
support

00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:40,540
I'm going to just sort highlighted on

00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,220
the conduct policy here because this is

00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:45,040
one of the key things we needed to get

00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:47,320
done prior to graduation we really

00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:50,770
wanted to make the project committee the

00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:53,590
PMC have a good set of guidelines that

00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:55,390
we could invoke as we get into

00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:56,770
argumentation or conflict and in the

00:21:55,390 --> 00:22:00,220
community we'd have a way to fall back

00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:02,530
and and reduce those issues and have a

00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:04,570
healthy community and not fall into a

00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:07,480
problem having poisonous people as they

00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:09,970
would say in that video take down the

00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,580
project health so the conduct policy has

00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:15,940
been drafted it's available on the site

00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:19,750
I think I've got that actually I've to

00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:21,310
somewhere yeah just a bit about that you

00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,650
know things like respect one another

00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:25,510
remember the OpenOffice mission be nice

00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:27,760
you know these are these obvious things

00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,980
but you know don't respond when you're

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,680
angry you know sit on it you know these

00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:36,310
are just general you know these are

00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:38,260
applicable to any project we definitely

00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:43,330
are benefitting from these now here at

00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:44,770
the apache openoffice project okay and i

00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:49,750
talked about milling us already we have

00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:54,370
all those lists yeah I'm going to do

00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:55,600
that okay let's move on I just want to

00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,310
talk briefly about something that's

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,510
going on the document space that's sort

00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,730
of i'm going to digress a little bit

00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:03,040
here open office application suite as i

00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,450
was just taking you through details but

00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,890
what what's really going on here with

00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,170
this open source project is pretty

00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:10,900
exciting if you think about the way

00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:14,160
we're building documents and in our

00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:16,360
current sort of spectrum of tools and

00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,460
technologies as many of us are now

00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,440
working in cloud environments working on

00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:23,020
our mobile devices on our phones no

00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,430
tablets you really have made the

00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,990
progression from us an era where

00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:29,110
documents were closed and in a kind of a

00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:30,900
binary sense of black box and the

00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:33,700
contents of that docket file will repay

00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,350
the monoculture that was building those

00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,740
file formats you know inhibited

00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:42,490
innovation really prevented anybody to

00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:45,220
really join that joint in business with

00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:47,520
a file format in this ODF since becoming

00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,930
open and with xml technology

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,700
the contents of a document file are now

00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:53,820
open and transparent can be inspected

00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:56,160
programmatically and vites innovation in

00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:58,040
the Buried entry for any developer with

00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,090
a great really great idea is quite low

00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,620
so things are really changing and have

00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:03,270
been changing in this way for some

00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,920
number of years another way of thinking

00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:07,170
about it is in the past we had office

00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,610
documents that were unstructured format

00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:10,320
intensive if you know you're always

00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:12,960
worried about your bold italic

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,580
underscore and your your font and those

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,050
sorts of things that we're not in a

00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,000
structured sentence but dunce or ad hoc

00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:20,130
it you were building a document there

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,860
was a sort of very very strong focus on

00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:24,450
your print output think back to the days

00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,630
where you know you were wrestling the

00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:30,500
print drivers in you know the old when

00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:33,600
early Windows days it was really a bear

00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:36,000
and over over time the network effect of

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,400
the file format itself locked users into

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,140
that that monoculture I mean now moving

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,120
today to a world war documents much more

00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:45,330
social we're building documents with

00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:47,280
quickies on blog content we're putting

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:49,560
content in our smartphones and our

00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,880
tablets we really kind of insular to the

00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,190
format it so you can mark up language

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,560
for those devices or it might be XML

00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:56,820
we're very seldom printing documents

00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,370
unless you're in a particular industry

00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,290
like legal or government when you

00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:03,300
actually have to print a document sign

00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:04,890
it with ink and pen that kind of

00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,710
antiquated way of going forward with

00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:09,540
documents they become much more social

00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,830
in terms of commenting and review and

00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,990
approval and the sort of the overall

00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:15,060
life cycle of the document authoring

00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:17,250
process is not in business at least is

00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:19,290
not so much done by a single individual

00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:21,000
anymore but by teams of people working

00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:23,060
asynchronously in some cases

00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,670
synchronously on that document content

00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:29,090
and lastly here that these two last

00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:32,490
points semantically rich in programmable

00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:35,910
with ODF 12 we added RDF metadata

00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:37,710
capability in spac so open office and

00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,990
other ODF implementations can now start

00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:42,120
to take advantage of that and do things

00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:44,760
with metadata either Tassili or

00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:47,000
explicitly to make it easier to search

00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,080
fine and locate document fragments

00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,890
understand provenance of a document

00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:54,420
segment a paragraph a footnote lots of

00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:56,900
different interesting and use cases can

00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:59,010
be exploited using metadata and

00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,990
programmable in the sense that

00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:02,790
we've done spinning projects in the ODF

00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:06,090
community one of which is at Apache also

00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:08,520
the Apache ODF toolkit a Java library

00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:12,390
for programming document solutions using

00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:14,670
the open document format so what is odia

00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:16,500
fo DFS next Mel specification it was

00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:20,090
created by sun microsystems and donated

00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:22,380
to oasis in 2001 we have a multi-vendor

00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:25,440
TC technical committee working on the

00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:29,580
ODF specification at oasis we meet every

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:31,950
week every Monday we've had a 10

00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:35,430
ratified by the ISO organization in

00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:37,080
Europe and a1 dot 1122 is now finished

00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:40,800
as a waste is standard in making its way

00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:42,960
into I so this year so what continues as

00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:46,350
I've mentioned we have tool kits in in

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,030
Java or Python nobody fpy for a

00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:50,760
programming OT of doctors in pi thought

00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:52,560
that's your preferred language some

00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,350
really great innovations in OT f py done

00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:59,400
by a team in Paris they're doing really

00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:00,840
cool stuff there so audio if we believe

00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,610
the ODF really gives you the most

00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,530
choices for interoperability and future

00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:07,110
proofing your your information your

00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:10,830
document content we think is too elegant

00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:11,790
and pragmatically implementable just a

00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:15,810
bit about the idea of time when I

00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:17,730
mentioned 10 11 12 we continue to work

00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:20,700
on that I mentioned already have

00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:23,000
metadata now here's what's really

00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:26,340
interesting what's Microsoft response

00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,100
you can see that very little response to

00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:31,980
support ODF it starting with 11 and in

00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,870
office 2007 hoping that it saved but in

00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,810
reality it was really kind of dead on

00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:39,300
arrival it didn't really work

00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:41,910
particularly spreadsheets if you

00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:44,670
progress through to office 2010 it gets

00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:47,300
a little better this this is actually

00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:50,790
table source from a blog post by

00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:54,720
Microsoft Office of Peter gray Knowlton

00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:56,460
last August 2012 and you can check it

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,170
out for yourself there for this right

00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:01,490
column office 15 is that what they call

00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:05,250
the new office adding ODF 10 to support

00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:07,500
but much more seriously so we're in the

00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:09,480
process of testing more detail how well

00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,549
that sport is rendered but

00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,840
I think this is going to be an ongoing

00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:15,059
challenge to improve interoperability

00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:18,419
with the xml formats from microsoft and

00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:21,000
ODF right now at the TC we're working

00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:24,660
out on ODF 13 primarily a focus on

00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,510
change tracking spec an area the spec

00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:30,390
that was missing we voted a technical

00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:31,919
solution to be approved and so that the

00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:35,190
early development of the spec is behind

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,919
us now we're into the CD the community

00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:40,470
drafting point standards work is time

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:43,410
consuming it moves slowly but we're

00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:45,240
going to get there so I mentioned the

00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:47,549
idea of toolkit it's a little more about

00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:50,010
that it's it's no DF API exposing a high

00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:52,440
level abstraction of the open document

00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:54,540
format for our developers so you can

00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,780
quickly get productive building audio

00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:59,460
solutions and process document content

00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:01,080
the goal the project was to reduce the

00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,450
friction you know the resistance to

00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:06,330
building a new class at programmable

00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:08,970
document solutions so just a couple

00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:11,190
examples or what i'll give you a right

00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:12,210
off the bat here's Andrew was mentioning

00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:15,360
one of his colleagues in the

00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:16,860
accessibility area recently used the ODF

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,940
toolkit to generate documents for

00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:22,710
testing in inaccessibility their eighth

00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:24,299
another solution was a large banking

00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:27,150
environment in Germany needed to process

00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:29,130
a high volume of documents in a you know

00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:30,600
yeah I think they were just it wasn't

00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:32,490
like a mainframe solution that was just

00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:35,400
tearing through pile of documents and we

00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:36,870
needed to create ODF xml so in a very

00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,750
headless fashion a very highly automated

00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:41,340
way the solution was rendered this

00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:44,910
particular project is in the incubator

00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:48,179
right now is it's staffed with a very

00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:51,059
small team so take a look it's pretty

00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:53,040
pretty cool stuff a lot of the commedia

00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:55,650
say p eyes are done we're going to have

00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:58,799
a release i think in a week or so very

00:29:55,650 --> 00:30:02,010
soon Devon a set new release so go over

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,660
there and take a look so what are we

00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:07,740
doing right now with open often in our

00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:10,080
work stream well I mean I mentioned our

00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,700
focus on you know building the community

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,860
and mentor you know asking for new

00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,900
volunteers step forward one of the

00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:17,670
challenges we kind of run into is we had

00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:20,140
too much success and

00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:23,170
and we had we had a call for QA

00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:25,030
volunteers before the holidays and in a

00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:27,610
matter of a few days we had a 50 people

00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:29,080
stacked up and the timing was a little

00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:32,260
we didn't sort of think i had the

00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:34,810
holidays were looming and so our veteran

00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:36,790
QA team kind of went off on holiday when

00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:39,100
we had our volunteers waiting to be

00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:40,740
instructed you know it's like a little

00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:43,570
bit embarrassing so we learned from that

00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:46,840
but this is something that I think will

00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:48,370
get better and smoother over time as I

00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,560
showed you earlier we have a lot of the

00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:52,720
tools and instructions available on the

00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:55,600
wiki and on the website have to help

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,780
newbies get it gets get oriented so that

00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:01,120
that's an ongoing process technically in

00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:03,640
the in the 40 planning process we are

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,180
focusing on the user interface Open

00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:09,670
Office is a pretty old you I to be

00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:11,710
honest I mean it was it was designed in

00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:14,380
90s and buffed up a little bit in the

00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:16,930
first decade but it really hasn't you

00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:18,130
know hasn't kept pace with the times so

00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:20,140
we're doing a couple things we're

00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:21,640
working on bringing it from symphony

00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,770
with an award-winning feature which was

00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:26,710
the sidebar or property panel in

00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:29,110
Symphony which is a very efficient way

00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:31,360
to to adjust properties in your

00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:33,550
documents so we're looking at bringing

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,180
that inversion that into open all of us

00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:38,760
and we're making good progress their

00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:41,410
continued focus on interoperability

00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:44,290
again with source from IBM symphony

00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:47,770
coming in to improve our ODF and open

00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:49,000
XML interoperability some of us in the

00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:51,940
design area particularly around

00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,770
marketing and user experience design or

00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:57,490
offering ideas around refreshing the

00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:59,440
brand so this means logo some of the

00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:01,720
sort of skinning if you will of the

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,630
OpenOffice splash screen and home pages

00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:08,740
and so forth so that that discussion and

00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:10,300
that process is fully underway now more

00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:12,250
difficult to space is accessibility

00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,980
porting over the I accessible to

00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:16,500
framework from symphony this aside

00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:18,730
comment about that the eye to

00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:21,160
specification itself was drafted by an

00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:23,590
IBM accessibility expert and contributed

00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,390
to the open standards organization

00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:26,890
right before it was shortened to the

00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:29,740
Linux Foundation in late two thousand

00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:32,200
six the Ashland coding of that I a to

00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:34,690
spec was done by the IBM symphony team

00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,580
in China and I'll be invested millions

00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:38,860
of dollars there we also invested in the

00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,900
seven million dollars actually working

00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:44,049
with the accessible technology vendor

00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:48,130
the ATV community for screen readers

00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:51,159
screen magnifiers and other tools that

00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:53,950
enable documents to be perceived by

00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:57,070
individual with disabilities so that's a

00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:59,919
big area this complex and one that we're

00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:03,070
taking on to finish for Windows this

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,809
year on open office improvements in

00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:06,549
writer and draw I mentioned our guy are

00:33:04,809 --> 00:33:09,250
means LeGrande is doing great works in

00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:11,500
and draw Oliver bittman is doing some

00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:13,690
really cool things in the writer tool so

00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,370
we'll see improvements there the last

00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:17,679
item here at patch delivery mechanism

00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:19,000
we're hearing from large enterprise

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,250
accounts that are really seriously

00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,659
talking about deploying forty thousand

00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:25,299
one one thousand two hundred thousand

00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:27,429
seats of apache openoffice right now and

00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:29,200
they're not going to get there if we

00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:30,640
don't deliver a really good patch

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,490
delivery mechanism that allows them to

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,770
update their instance of openoffice on

00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:37,929
desktops incrementally rather than

00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:39,580
wiping out the old version slamming on a

00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:42,520
new version and chewing of the network

00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:44,140
bandwidth in the process so our goal is

00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:48,640
to deliver a patch delivery mechanism

00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:49,840
also leader in 2013 how does it look on

00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,120
the chart well and you put it all

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,529
together this is what it looks like you

00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:57,520
know starting in the lower left-hand

00:33:53,529 --> 00:34:00,640
corner with 34 on May of 2012 341 August

00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:03,429
graduation 40 we're talking now may june

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,220
that's kind of the chatter on list looks

00:34:03,429 --> 00:34:07,480
like a you know an hour see in May and

00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:10,000
several RCS before we get to a release

00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:13,659
candidate that is going to be the formal

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,190
one bishop in june for dot one we think

00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:18,399
could be six months later so the end of

00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:20,109
2013 and again I've kind of stacked up

00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:23,200
all the content that we're planning in

00:34:20,109 --> 00:34:25,270
that box in the upper left and I've

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,960
talked about almost all that so I'm not

00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:30,159
going to go over it again this a little

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,619
more of a drill down in terms of

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,559
usability

00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:37,710
and we had a really couple very good

00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:40,769
experts in UI design working on color

00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:43,019
schemes panel design and so forth you

00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:44,909
can go to this is a link i'm not going

00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:46,679
to go there now but on a wiki if you

00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:49,440
want to want to drill into that you can

00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:55,529
do so and see all the different I'll

00:34:49,440 --> 00:35:02,609
take a quick look all the sea I got it

00:34:55,529 --> 00:35:04,230
down here somewhere that here oh yeah so

00:35:02,609 --> 00:35:06,839
this is the UI the user experience

00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:10,349
design exploration the task panel task

00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:12,509
content panel different proposals so

00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:14,700
these males seem very similar to you but

00:35:12,509 --> 00:35:17,579
they're actually different so we're

00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:20,789
actually you know examining different

00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:23,130
visual treatments for these panels and

00:35:20,789 --> 00:35:25,799
as Andre and the team in Germany is

00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:27,749
coding them up so these are progressing

00:35:25,799 --> 00:35:30,779
quite well and going to give a real new

00:35:27,749 --> 00:35:35,400
level of productivity in 40 we're pretty

00:35:30,779 --> 00:35:36,660
excited about this stuff ok after the 40

00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,239
plan we're going to move on to some real

00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:40,859
lot more some of less exciting things

00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:43,109
like a number in bullet settings that's

00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:45,960
been a common complaint picking up

00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:47,759
presentations instant filtering data

00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,529
pilot functionality some other things

00:35:47,759 --> 00:35:53,519
that are little more prosaic than the

00:35:49,529 --> 00:35:56,789
sudden bigger ones and 40 a little drill

00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:58,170
down accessibility here the condom you

00:35:56,789 --> 00:36:02,039
can see how we're really breaking the

00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:04,109
project work down you know it's complex

00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:07,440
with the big in the you aid to a t-tube

00:36:04,109 --> 00:36:09,420
bridge in that sort of been done we

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,119
actually finished this februari deadline

00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:14,789
was completed we're now we know have

00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:16,380
builds available for test I've reached

00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:20,009
out to the accessibility community in

00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:21,690
universities and some of the open source

00:36:20,009 --> 00:36:24,450
accessibility experts down in Australia

00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:25,890
project called NVDA they're getting

00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:27,569
really excited about this so this is

00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:29,730
like this doctor really gained momentum

00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:32,519
quite soon as testing begins in earnest

00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:34,040
and we get this thing to really work

00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:36,690
properly

00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:39,510
ok so now about extensions this is just

00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:41,250
an example but as I mentioned extensions

00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:43,770
have been done for years and years by

00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:45,690
the community I just highlight a couple

00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:47,099
of the IBM is doing some people always

00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:48,810
asking why is IBM inserted in this

00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:51,630
project you don't make any money on is

00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:53,130
free what are you guys doing what we're

00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:55,260
doing is we're extending openoffice to

00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:57,330
bolt into some of our social business

00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,740
applications so we have a cloud

00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:00,960
environment will go IBM connections

00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:02,550
which has a complete set of sort of

00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,180
facebook like functionality hardened for

00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:08,970
business blogging with these profiles

00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:11,090
the holsters typical range of function

00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:13,430
you would think of in social framework

00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:18,240
it actually is an OpenSocial container

00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:20,310
and it has a file repository function so

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,670
we're saving as from open office

00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:24,690
directly into the IBM connections files

00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:28,890
making the documents available for

00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:31,920
operation by cloud tools mus1 one

00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:33,500
example another one this is just a was a

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,300
proof of concept we did about a year ago

00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:38,880
we have this teed up for Asha coding and

00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:40,950
delivery later this year but we took

00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,390
advantage of the open office API and the

00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:44,460
idea here with surrender documents

00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:46,109
Social you're working on your desktop

00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:47,910
but you really are want to be connected

00:37:46,109 --> 00:37:51,000
to your community your network that's in

00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:53,970
your social framework so we we actually

00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,790
customize the UI appears they would

00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:58,890
share your chart with your network and

00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:01,080
then what we were talking about really

00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:04,080
doing is sharing the chart into your

00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:05,490
activity stream in connections cimmyt

00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,170
it's analogous to putting into a

00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:10,619
facebook stream for example or a Google+

00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:13,440
stream and then once it's there then you

00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:14,609
asked for a comment so if I can see this

00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,000
very well here but that's the actual

00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:19,740
chart there when you the person publish

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,050
the chart they asked for review and

00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:24,660
comment and they did get the comments

00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:26,720
here and then we actually encoded in the

00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,880
demo so that the comments were returned

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,619
seamlessly back to the year

00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,960
editing session and openoffice on your

00:38:30,619 --> 00:38:34,579
desktop so you could continue to edit on

00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,880
your desktop but have that feedback from

00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:42,170
your social network okay pretty pretty

00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:44,180
cool stuff as I said extensions are not

00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:47,319
consistently licensed so we had to host

00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:49,970
them outside the foundation sourceforge

00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:51,829
made a very generous offer to host our

00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:55,250
extensions and extensions at

00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:57,890
openoffice.org and so they're all up

00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:59,809
there now this is actually chart

00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:02,059
contributed by my swash friend rich

00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:04,970
Bowen who's not in the room but y'all

00:39:02,059 --> 00:39:07,220
know rich you know if they had to do a

00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:10,250
lot of extra work here we really do

00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:13,160
appreciate it very much so the extra

00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:15,440
site is also not just extensions but

00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,269
also templates so many people do

00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,670
templates for specific types of

00:39:17,269 --> 00:39:20,990
documents and you can upload those at

00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,690
template set up an office or I can make

00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:25,460
them available to anyone to use very

00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:29,539
very cool way to make openoffice much

00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:31,940
more useful makes a comment about is

00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:34,309
using kupil so if it doesn't act you out

00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:38,720
of this that's a rich comet Joe I don't

00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:40,549
take it for it okay so another area that

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,269
which really helped us was planning our

00:39:40,549 --> 00:39:46,220
downloads we were quite concerned that

00:39:43,269 --> 00:39:48,230
apache infra was going to be having its

00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:50,930
hands full when we put three four up and

00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:53,269
swear just stepped in and and offered a

00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:55,250
pretty excessive mirror organist your

00:39:53,269 --> 00:39:59,240
spear setup which kind of looks like

00:39:55,250 --> 00:40:00,950
that and pretty pretty huge source for

00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:05,569
your network to support our our

00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:07,099
malaysian downloads pretty cool this is

00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:09,710
a sort of a screenshot of the download

00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:11,839
stats i was talking about again python

00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:14,180
scripts fight from sourceforge that

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:16,039
we've wired in this is not a this takes

00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:17,630
a manual updating so if you go to open

00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:19,789
house the rogue stats right now you I

00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:22,069
think you Elsie februari 24th might be

00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:25,190
the last date 39 million in something

00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:27,710
and change since it's februari 27th and

00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:29,509
i'm pretty sure or 40 million the top

00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:33,470
though their daily downloads just he

00:40:29,509 --> 00:40:34,370
just bouncing along and it runs about

00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:37,850
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:41,150
five thousand downloads a day spikes 290

00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:43,880
sometimes 170 but it's been you can see

00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:45,680
I've been pretty consistent and you know

00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,080
these big dips back here in August

00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:53,180
that's when we shift our 341 so it goes

00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:55,760
up when we do a new release one of our

00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:57,950
project members Rob we were did a of

00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,590
this map using the IBM any eyes

00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:03,290
technology sort of this a little arcane

00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:05,000
but but just you're visually speaking it

00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:06,440
gives you an idea that Europe it really

00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,600
is where the saturation point is for

00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:11,000
downloading of openoffice but we also

00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:12,590
the Falkland Islands we've got you know

00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,800
some other interesting interesting

00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:17,800
places downloading an apache openoffice

00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:23,600
it so just to wrap up other big reasons

00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:26,090
I'm here I'm constantly trying to learn

00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,980
more about other project is Apache that

00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:30,110
have sort of complementary relationships

00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:33,680
and so I've kind of grouped them in

00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:36,650
three areas here social tools and

00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:41,330
document stores so in social area Apache

00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:43,030
rave shindig are key I really excited

00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:45,580
about the opportunity to team up with

00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:48,400
Raven shindig a little more proactively

00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:51,080
and do some things with documents that

00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:54,050
haven't been done before to make them

00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:56,000
social and tooling we have the audio

00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:58,670
toolkit as I mentioned but obviously the

00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,920
poi project one of our key members and

00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:02,750
mentors Dave Fisher is unemployed

00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:06,110
project and keeps bringing that up

00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:08,480
occasionally tika pdfbox for documents

00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:11,570
tours chemistry and jack rabbit I'm sure

00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,460
leaving some out but you know the

00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:15,350
foundation wouldn't be as vibrant and as

00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:17,810
exciting as it is if we weren't looking

00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:20,360
sideways inter and really looking around

00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:21,980
to see what projects could bear on one

00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:25,160
we're working on to improve what we're

00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:29,330
doing and you know share and mutual

00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:31,790
benefit usual but if it occurs so join

00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:34,610
us and work together if you like I'm

00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:40,250
available for today and tomorrow Andrew

00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:42,010
hears from the PMC also so you tackle us

00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:43,530
in the hallway we've got

00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:51,490
to you about openoffice more detail

00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:52,870
Thanks any questions if you have a

00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:54,400
question I think I'm supposed to ask you

00:42:52,870 --> 00:43:02,830
to use the microphone for the benefit of

00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:09,070
the video okay all right thanks help me

00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:11,950
do a question yeah you talk to the

00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:15,900
beginning that is working now you said

00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:19,860
at the beginning that sort of long-term

00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:23,200
aspirations of openoffice as a project

00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:25,030
include largely providing a free

00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,920
alternative to Microsoft's Office peaked

00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:28,380
obviously and also providing

00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:32,350
opportunities for innovation in the

00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:36,220
document editing yes sphere the user

00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:38,950
interface and the paradigms of sort of

00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:40,750
style tweaking type of formatting as you

00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:42,850
as you write a document that seems to be

00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:45,070
one of the areas where there's not been

00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:47,800
much changing of it exactly seems to me

00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:50,260
as a user that focus so far with good

00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,480
reason has been on parity of user

00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:55,750
experience with Microsoft sir main stuff

00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:59,260
and I just wondered if you knew or have

00:43:55,750 --> 00:44:00,880
anything to say about plans either

00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:05,290
within the project or outside the

00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:08,950
project for sort of getting away from

00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:10,840
that getting more towards well the

00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:12,280
elements are 0 ms document structure

00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,380
yeah i think i think the elephant here

00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:16,570
is in the room is is tablet right if

00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:19,030
openoffice was to be surfaced on a

00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:20,260
tablet with gesture that would be a

00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:23,560
radical change in the user interface

00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:28,030
right oh I was thinking more from google

00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:30,070
love no even Google Docs is rather stuck

00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:32,110
to the sort of you know select I telecom

00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:34,370
select bold rather than sort of format

00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:36,830
your document as a structure of you know

00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:38,870
heading and mint and so like have really

00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:41,450
kind of first class style management

00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:43,700
that's my kind of all right okay it's

00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:46,610
just a style management is not really to

00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:48,830
me a true that I agree with you that's

00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:51,290
what I call that out with the ODF

00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:52,910
section you know the unstructured

00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:55,570
documents is a nice way of saying the

00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:58,220
sort of mess you create when you use

00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:59,870
point and click and and users just go

00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:01,250
crazy they don't understand templates

00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:02,540
they don't ascend Styles properly they

00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:05,450
override them they create unique

00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:08,870
situations yeah I think templates is a

00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:11,270
way to really help to prove that so you

00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:14,690
know building good templates gives you a

00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:18,520
way to structure your documents de saw

00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:22,070
it it does odf you said it was a sort of

00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:25,190
elegant design yeah does odia provides

00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:26,630
it it does a good framework it does yeah

00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:28,430
it take take a look at the toolkit if

00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:30,440
you if you want to if you've got your

00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:33,110
Java skills sharp you and use Java use

00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:37,070
your tool kit if Python and Yulia p why

00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:39,020
but yeah you can and I don't know the

00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:40,520
details of what and just colleague did

00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:42,770
with generating documents but you can

00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:45,020
generate of structured documents in

00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:48,490
programmatically quite quickly using

00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:51,350
those two lot those api's unity of XML

00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:52,970
but I think your point where's more how

00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:55,550
are we going to you know adjust the user

00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:56,960
interface for end users so you're that's

00:45:55,550 --> 00:46:01,900
really like that kind of whether you

00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:07,840
have an unfortunate directions it's it's

00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:10,210
this everything everybody has this kind

00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:12,550
of idea wow you really need it we could

00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:15,670
change the whole paradigm comfortable

00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:18,100
create documents and but at the same

00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:19,690
time if you look even if Microsoft when

00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:23,860
they just sort of killed the ribbon

00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:25,840
instead of toolbar and the buyer that

00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:29,080
they took back with you know pretty

00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:30,700
substantial and so I think it's a bit of

00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:35,860
a problem in the fact that when you do

00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:37,990
try and change these paradigms it's very

00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:42,700
difficult because a lot of people are

00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:46,870
stuck in the current paradigm so I so

00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:48,640
it's a difficult problem and at some

00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:51,550
point someone will create something that

00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:55,450
you know moves everything for quantum

00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:57,340
leap it would be great if someone showed

00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:58,930
up in the project and not offer to do

00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:03,030
this at the same time I think you know

00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:07,060
the current focus of the project is on

00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:09,640
you know some somewhere near early

00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:10,750
voters it's one of yeah we're challenged

00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,700
with having you know 40 million

00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:15,010
downloads and we have a user community

00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:17,440
you know it doesn't want massive change

00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:20,230
but they do want improvement so it's

00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,780
incremental but the code the source is

00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:24,160
available in if you have in your

00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:28,680
initiative scratch and you want to dive

00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:35,250
in there you go go go for it okay thanks

00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:35,250
