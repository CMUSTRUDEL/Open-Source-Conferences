bite hyper Viper stands for video

00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:40,170
Internet Protocol engineering and

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:45,030
research Viper next next it's a voice

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:46,980
the voice is not working Siri Viper is

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:51,090
based in groovy lower downtown Denver

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:54,660
Colorado lodo they call it and we watch

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,760
TV at work the group that would become

00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:03,449
Viper got its start just over five years

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:08,369
ago that era was bi before iPad I was

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:10,049
employee number eight we were a

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:11,760
prototype software that received live

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:14,250
linear television off of satellites

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,990
transcoded it into IP video played it

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,070
back in browsers using flash and

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:29,840
Silverlight HBO Showtime CNN ESPN we

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:33,299
watched TV at work Tori look I found him

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,920
Viper used and still uses the technology

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,049
called adaptive streaming where the

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,810
player gets to pick which bit rate which

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,390
profile which pixel resolution which

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,299
compression level it can playback

00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,979
successfully an ongoing heuristic based

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:52,200
on the cpu load and the network

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:56,880
connectivity adaptive streaming 288 3 64

00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:01,560
32 1080p 4k and beyond grainy less

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,780
grainy clear clear clear adaptive

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,909
streaming our goal at viper is to deploy

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,520
the IP video software that changes the

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:12,440
way we watch television I for one am

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:18,530

00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:24,620
