hi and welcome to Austin I saw a tweet

00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:07,109
the other day that this is the first

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,630
time that somebody had been here since

00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:11,550
2006 the last Apache khan in Austin and

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:15,030
it's the same for me it's great to be

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:17,250
back here in Austin and talking today so

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,660
rich introduce my cert me is the

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,189
president of the foundation but the

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,289
first thing I want to do is remove that

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:25,050
title because anybody who is around

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,300
Apache knows that titles don't really

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,580
mean anything other than the more ground

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:35,910
your title sounds the harder it is for

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:38,070
you to say no writ rich is the executive

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,600
vice president and rich doesn't say no

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,399
when we asked him to help organize a

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:49,530
conference which is an awful lot of work

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:50,879
so thanks a lot rich so many of you here

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,559
will know what the apache software

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,879
foundation is all about this is

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,609
something from our our front page and it

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,559
says that we are an organization that

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,110
produces software for the public good

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:06,510
and that's really important to

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:10,350
understand the public good part of this

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:13,799
as a foundation we only exist to create

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,330
software for everybody the technical

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,360
decisions that are made within the

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,950
projects or by those projects and they

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,630
make those decisions for the benefit of

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,960
everybody in the community that is

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,939
contributing you can't buy influence in

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,740
the apache software foundation other

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:30,900
than by paying people who are going to

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,140
contribute and earn merit within the

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:37,229
within the project so it's a foundation

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,090
we don't exist to manage the projects we

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,310
don't exist to guide the projects or

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,640
nothing like that we only exist to

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:47,189
support the project and that's

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,070
particularly important because we're for

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:52,619
our focus is on the communities it's on

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,899
the people who create the code we have a

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,329
mantra of community / code some people

00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,790
prefer community before code in both

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,619
cases it means the same thing if we look

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,290
after the community and if we provide an

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:07,229
environment for a community to thrive

00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:08,929
then good code will emerge from that so

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,470
that's what the foundation is all about

00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:13,630
but it takes a lot of time

00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:17,470
and effort and resources to provide that

00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:19,330
kind of support to our organizations so

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,860
I wanted light rich start with a big

00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,500
thank you Thea if you could follow to

00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,690
that link for me please and we have

00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,040
sponsors and these are our sponsors he

00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:30,280
is going to scratch scroll down the page

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,680
for us and we have plenty of platinum

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,860
sponsors but these people all of these

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:40,300
sponsors all they do is give us money

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:43,510
now all they do you know yeah is that

00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:45,280
all well what else can we have and they

00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,440
give us money but they don't expect

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,770
anything in return we give them a

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,540
thank-you page and that's it we have a

00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,190
bunch of gold sponsors as one logo

00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,260
missing from there as I found out this

00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:58,900
morning we should have Bloomberg in the

00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,420
gold sponsors as well again no influence

00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:04,330
over the projects or even the foundation

00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:07,330
we have a bunch of silver sponsors we

00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:10,480
also have a bunch of I forget what we

00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,850
call our bronze sponsors as the is the

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,320
lower tier all of these people are

00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,940
critical to the success of the

00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,310
foundation and every one of those

00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,410
sponsors gives us more than money they

00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,260
also give us resources within the

00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:25,090
communities the very vast classification

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,950
the infrastructure sponsors are

00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,420
particularly important in the sense that

00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,459
whilst they don't give us money they

00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,680
give us goods and services and things

00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:34,959
that our infrastructure team need to

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,459
support our projects so let's give a

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,120
round of applause to all of our sponsors

00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:39,120
thank you

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:52,049
banksia ok so we consider ourselves a

00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,480
reasonably important organization in the

00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:57,780
sense that we produce software that's a

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,640
value with 15 years old this year and in

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,209
fact our first project the Apache web

00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:07,109
server is 20 years old and I have in my

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:10,290
hand a rather grand document with a wax

00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:11,670
seal and all sorts it's very posh I'd

00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,959
just like to take a moment to read you

00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:17,850
what it says on here be it known that

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,889
whereas we are pleased welcome apache

00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,250
software foundation an all-volunteer

00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:25,949
nonprofit organization to austin for

00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:28,680
their Apache conference and celebration

00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:31,320
of their 15th anniversary and we're at

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,410
Apache products power half the internet

00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:37,380
managed exabytes of data execute

00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:39,180
teraflops of operations store billions

00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,970
of objects in virtually every industry

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:46,139
and enhance the lives of users and

00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:47,910
developers worldwide and whereas Apache

00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:50,760
has achieved its success with an all

00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,650
volunteer community are comprised of

00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:56,190
five hundred and five individual members

00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:59,910
and 4081 Apache committers collaborating

00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:02,130
across six continents and whereas we

00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:04,500
extend best wishes that this gathering

00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:06,360
of open-source community will increase

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,520
knowledge and collaboration on the

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,520
technologies and projects driving the

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:15,479
future of open-source big data and cloud

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,479
computing now therefore I Steve Adler

00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:22,050
Mayor of the City of Austin Texas do

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:26,690
proclaim april the 13th to the 16th 2015

00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,690
as apache software foundation days

00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:38,259
that kind of recognition comes about

00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:40,180
because of you and all of those

00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:41,740
committers all those contributors all of

00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,349
those users who provide was with

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:49,779
feedback the community that we're here

00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:53,560
to provide support for so we're 15 years

00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:56,759
old but we keep growing if we could

00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,259
follow the link the first one please

00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,029
this is a graph of the growth of the

00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:03,460
foundation over the years right over

00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:05,289
here on the Left 1995 the first blue

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,650
line was the creation of the Apache web

00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:10,960
server so this was a group of people

00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,340
there was no foundation at this point it

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,909
was a group of people who got together

00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:18,460
to share Cove this further up here that

00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:20,919
you see is actually from that very first

00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,770
group there's a very famous photo or

00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:26,289
famous within Apache at least we're that

00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:28,599
weather appears and it's considered a

00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:30,430
part of our history a very important

00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:32,740
part of our history it signifies that

00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:36,249
group of people who came together in the

00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,110
first instance we fast forward to the

00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:39,939
year 2000 and the second little blue

00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,650
line indicating another project was

00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:43,180
created that was actually the conference

00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:45,849
committee it wasn't a software project

00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:48,399
it was the start of the foundation and

00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:49,750
the first the second project within the

00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,009
foundation was the conference committee

00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,490
because if you're going to look after

00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:58,629
community you need a conference at that

00:06:54,490 --> 00:07:01,300
point the foundation was created it was

00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:03,189
the Apache group that said hey we've got

00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,069
to protect the IP in this we've got to

00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:08,409
make this happen in a way that means our

00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:11,529
work our effort is for the public good

00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:13,719
and we all owe a debt of gratitude to

00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:16,210
that original Apache group who 15 years

00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:18,339
ago set up the foundation which in terms

00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:21,550
of its bylaws has changed very little

00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:23,800
over the years it still exists the way

00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:27,149
it was envisioned then so thank you to

00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,149
the Apache group for doing that

00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,160
now you can see from the red line that

00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,940
the foundation continues to grow and in

00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,310
fact the pace of growth is increasing so

00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:46,200
we're doing well as a foundation if we

00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:49,410
could go back to the slides please our

00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:52,230
growth is bringing more and more

00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:54,210
diversity to the foundation we have over

00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:56,340
sixty-two percent of our projects are

00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,840
java projects but we have nearly 40

00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,570
languages represented within the

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,850
foundation the expertise that we have in

00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:05,460
the foundation is really quite amazing

00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:09,060
if you've got a problem in almost any

00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:10,980
real any language in use today there's

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:15,090
bound to be somebody somewhere who can

00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:18,570
help we also have diversity in the terms

00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:20,460
of the domains that we address we've

00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:22,890
gone long past the point of being a web

00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:25,350
server and we cover over 30 different

00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:28,800
domains things like libraries that are

00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:30,870
intended for reuse network service web

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,200
frameworks big data database network

00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:36,479
clients etc again that diversity brings

00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,430
a huge wealth of knowledge that we share

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,180
within the community to make all of the

00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:43,770
projects stronger and better which

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:48,390
brings us to another point that we find

00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:50,160
on our home page that we are a we're not

00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,950
simply a group of project sharing a

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,960
server or many servers in this case but

00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:57,020
rather a community of developers an

00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,940
increasingly a community of communities

00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:02,400
so there are plenty of places you can

00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,920
host your code there aren't so many

00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,170
places where you can build diverse

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,550
communities that feed off one another in

00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:12,960
the way they do in the apache software

00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:15,450
foundation so rich promised we'd say

00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:19,020
what we've done with the sponsors money

00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:21,480
here it is this is actually the full

00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,850
year not since the last last Apache con

00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,900
so the middle column is the fy15 budget

00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,710
and you'll see that we intended to spend

00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,480
something in the region of two hundred

00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,760
and fifty thousand dollars more than we

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,200
took in this really isn't a problem

00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,020
we've got plenty of money in the bank

00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,060
this was by design the infrastructure

00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,370
team had identified a lot of things they

00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,529
wanted to improve

00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:45,110
and requested a much larger than usual

00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:46,580
budget we approve that budget and the

00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,200
infrastructure team actually hasn't

00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,490
spent anywhere near what they asked for

00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,140
although I believe there's a lot of

00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,220
expenses going in this month because

00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:56,150
we're getting towards the end of the

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:58,790
year of the year and but the team have

00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:02,510
worked extremely hard to improve our

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:04,450
infrastructure and keep costs down now

00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:06,710
anybody in this room who does

00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:08,420
infrastructure for their company will

00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:10,970
probably be amazed at the budget that

00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:13,279
our team have I'm going to dig into what

00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,860
that money is spent on in a few moments

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,890
but they work on a shoestring and keep

00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:22,400
those projects alive our second biggest

00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:23,900
expense is media and publicity I'm going

00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,460
to dig into that too in a few moments

00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:28,010
and tell you about how that's broken

00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,930
down the third line is administration

00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,970
that's things like legal fees accounting

00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:35,150
fees or executive assistant things like

00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:37,520
that the travel assistance committee is

00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:40,190
a very important committee this is a

00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:42,110
team of people who ensure that people

00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,810
who couldn't travel to Apache come

00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,820
without some form of financial help have

00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:49,100
an opportunity to get that financial

00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,420
help and we have some people in the room

00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,650
who have been brought here with the

00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:54,140
assistance of the travel assistance

00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:56,209
committee and I think we should welcome

00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:59,260
those people and thank the committee for

00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:59,260
ensuring they're here

00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,240
and then there's the other category

00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,070
which is lots of other things the

00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,630
biggest chunk in there is is brand

00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,540
management where we're registering

00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:15,460
trademarks and so on the fy16 budget

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,280
doesn't look that much different and

00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:19,630
less being spent on infrastructure

00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,540
they've worked off a lot of that debt

00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:25,570
the technical debt but continue to do so

00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,820
in the next year so let's have a look at

00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:30,310
infrastructure we have something in the

00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:33,430
region of 50 machines across five

00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:36,940
different colocation environments we

00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:38,860
have eight where are using eight cloud

00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,260
regions across multiple different cloud

00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:44,070
providers we've got something in the

00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:46,810
region of 180 download mirrors that

00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:48,550
provide fast and efficient downloads of

00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:51,430
our software around the world that

00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:53,140
doesn't by the way include the service

00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:55,060
that source fours provide for openoffice

00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,860
Open Office has a particularly large

00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,280
download requirement and sourceforge

00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:02,050
have created a solution for us there

00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,640
over the last year over 1,700

00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,610
infrastructure tickets have been opened

00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:09,850
and closed and over 2,000 get commits

00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:12,880
the last number on their 16 contributors

00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:17,410
is a particularly interesting one we

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:20,500
have six and paid contractors in our

00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:22,360
infrastructure team so ten of those

00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,250
people are volunteers within the

00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,650
foundation that's one way we keep the

00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,600
cost down as low as possible and this

00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:31,810
happens across a whole of the foundation

00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,850
but these are the people who really make

00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,740
sure that everything for their projects

00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,000
is working well there are other people

00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,950
as well who don't actually end up

00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,040
committing to get that also support

00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,390
activity there we have those contractors

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,160
that I mentioned those are the ones who

00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:47,890
are on page of duty who make sure that

00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,440
our services come back up quickly and

00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:52,330
efficiently if anybody's ever interested

00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,280
in how the infrastructure is doing you

00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,500
can go at any time to stay to stop at

00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,000
sea org and last night when I looked a

00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,560
bit despite the fact that most of our

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,630
infrastructure team have been travelling

00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,700
to get here over the last few days it

00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:06,070
said everything is peachy everything was

00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:09,850
working and that is more often than not

00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:11,920
the case we consistently get very high

00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,270
reliability so there's many of the

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,950
infrastructure team on the front row

00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:22,490
here making sure I praise them a plenty

00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:24,050
so thank you and thank you to any other

00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:29,200
infrastructure I can't see because

00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:32,990
you're not pulling faces at me media

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,850
media and outreach is another contracted

00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:36,860
position we are the foundation we never

00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:39,020
pay for software development and we

00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,250
don't pay many people we pay people in

00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,870
infrastructure because we want the

00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,700
machines up and running when they go

00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:46,190
down in the middle of the night we also

00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,110
pay people in media relations and we pay

00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:50,030
an executive assistant who does a lot of

00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:52,010
the paper shuffling and coordination and

00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:55,210
things like that for us but other than

00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:58,100
that everybody else is a volunteer in

00:13:55,210 --> 00:14:00,410
case of the media relations we need to

00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:03,080
be able to react promptly to media

00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:04,820
requests hence we have a contractor plus

00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,610
we're engineers we don't how to do this

00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:10,940
stuff so over the year we've done a

00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:12,920
total of thirty-five press releases 291

00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,800
in formal announcement we've worked with

00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:19,160
26 different events awards and outreach

00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,950
organizations we've responded to 111

00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:25,340
media requests which results in 20 over

00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:27,950
21,000 press clippings we've conducted

00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:31,730
30 analyst briefings resulting in apache

00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:34,010
software being considered in 478 analyst

00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,900
reports and we've been very active this

00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:38,060
year in getting videos from various

00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,890
events around the world up on YouTube to

00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:43,610
try and get individual projects

00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:46,460
mentioned now all of that work tends to

00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,950
be focused on foundation level items

00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:51,770
we're not talking about individual

00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:53,390
projects with over a hundred and sixty

00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,910
top-level projects and a total of three

00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:58,160
hundred different initiatives it's not

00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:01,310
really possible for the foundation to do

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,920
detailed media engagement for each of

00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:05,840
those projects so we have an entry point

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,790
which then works with the project

00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,670
communities to give the responses that

00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:12,410
are necessary now one of the things that

00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:15,800
I personally want to look at over the

00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:19,300
coming year is helping those pmcs to

00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:21,290
help themselves more there are problems

00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:24,050
not really problems there are

00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:26,030
difficulties with pmcs doing their own

00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:29,180
media because as I said we're all

00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:31,400
engineers now in the Apache way

00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:34,460
any contribution is recognized as

00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:37,220
valuable so if you have people in your

00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:39,680
teams in your companies that are not

00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,500
necessarily engineers that doesn't mean

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,510
they haven't got things to do we can use

00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:47,000
media people we can use documentation

00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:49,190
writers we can use pretty much any skill

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,600
that's available so let's have them

00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,700
coming into the projects and be

00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,280
recognized within the projects so the

00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:59,350
foundation can leverage this resource to

00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:01,400
provide more support for more projects

00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:03,920
if you want to know more about what's

00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,030
happening in the foundation in a you

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,910
know instead of waiting for the next

00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:11,420
Apache Khan you can go to our wonderful

00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:14,360
whimsy tool now whimsy Apache org slash

00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:16,160
board / minutes will take you to all the

00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:19,160
approved minutes i'm getting applause

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:24,080
from one of the m14 so good i said

00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:26,270
something they like that will give you

00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,290
access to all of the approved minutes so

00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:30,410
they're usually a couple of months

00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:32,180
behind if you want more up-to-date

00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,130
information you get all the

00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,440
announcements and so on then you can go

00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,090
to the announced mailing list you can

00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,550
subscribe there by sending a mail to

00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:42,920
announce that subscribe at Apache org

00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:45,860
and that's where all the the media

00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,430
outreach materials go quarterly status

00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,480
updates and all the useful information

00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:53,180
so that's what we've done over the last

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,520
and last year that's how we spent our

00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,900
sponsors money etc I want to now switch

00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,780
gears a little bit and start looking

00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,910
forwards start looking at okay what are

00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:04,160
we going to do over the next year now

00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:06,800
before I start doing this I have to make

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,570
it absolutely clear what happens over

00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,420
the next year is what the volunteers

00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:13,010
within the foundation do not what I say

00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,720
is going to happen what I'm going to

00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:16,580
talk about is something that I think is

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,740
important and i am going to be put in my

00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:22,010
time into whether i continue in my

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,690
current role or whether i am just active

00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:26,600
as a member within the foundation this

00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:28,190
is something i want to focus on and i

00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,730
think it's important that everybody in

00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:33,170
here who is a part of a PMC also thinks

00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:36,290
about doing some of the work that i'm

00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:39,860
going to talk about so first of all

00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:42,200
let's think about what apache is Apache

00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:44,580
is an innovation machine

00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:48,210
you know the proclamation said that all

00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:51,390
we do some really quite amazing stuff

00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:53,580
and we do it for public good we have an

00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:56,870
amazing level of knowledge and expertise

00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:59,429
we have unbelievable creativity our

00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:03,419
individual members and contributors and

00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:04,770
users are all highly motivated we have

00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:09,630
personalities boy do we have

00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:11,220
personalities we also have really good

00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,440
diversity when we look at the diversity

00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,150
of languages and technologies and things

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,370
like that when you put all this together

00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:19,620
and you crank the machine using the

00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:22,020
apache way the apache way that talks

00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:25,620
about community / code what you get is

00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:28,919
amazing code that is reusable by anybody

00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:32,610
in any environment for any purpose it's

00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:34,620
amazing what we managed to do on the

00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:38,610
resources we have available because of

00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:42,090
people like you there's one area though

00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:44,460
where I think we can do better diversity

00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:47,610
so talk about diversity from a technical

00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:50,669
angle or top that diversity for a number

00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:52,409
of other angles as well so why do we

00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:55,080
need diversity well there's a number of

00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:57,120
quotes we could use and so for example

00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,360
walter Lippmann says when all think

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,950
alike no one is thinking and I like this

00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,890
quote especially in the context of

00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:07,260
Apache because over 15 years those of us

00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:09,150
who have been around for in my case

00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:14,070
nearly 15 years but in plenty of other

00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:15,900
cases that fall 15 years we feel like

00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,370
we've considered everything we've

00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,659
considered every option we've made our

00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:23,640
choices that's the way it's going to go

00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:25,380
but if we continue to think like that if

00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,200
we don't listen to different opinions

00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:29,700
then we're not going to continue to

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,390
improve the processes improve the

00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:35,100
environment improve the communities

00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:37,200
Margaret hefferman said that for good

00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,390
ideas and true innovations you need

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,480
human interaction conflict argument

00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:44,780
debate we're not short of any of those

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,780
things

00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:51,450
definitely not short of any of those

00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:54,750
things but it's healthy we want more we

00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:57,540
want that interaction conflict argument

00:19:54,750 --> 00:20:01,500
in debate we need people to stand up and

00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:04,110
think differently to think and challenge

00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:09,450
the assumptions that we've had and over

00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:11,970
the 15 years Barbara Harrison said

00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:15,600
there's no original ideas only original

00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:17,610
people we have to listen to those

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,410
original people even if the ideas

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:22,110
they're coming don't sound original

00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:24,660
things change the environment changes we

00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:26,220
need to revisit constantly and look at

00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:29,820
different things we need more diversity

00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:31,320
to make this happen so let's look at

00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,840
diversity in the tech industry as a

00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,580
whole here in the US african-americans

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,350
make up six percent of the tech industry

00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:40,110
whereas if the population they make

00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:41,820
thirteen percent Latinos it's seven

00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:43,710
percent whereas in the population it's

00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,510
seventeen percent now yes i know

00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,390
somebody could be Latino and

00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:49,919
african-american that's fine whichever

00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:53,160
way you slice it it's

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,540
under-representation Asian Americans on

00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,549
the other hand it's fifteen percent

00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:58,860
whereas the population is five percent

00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:00,870
and most people seem to think that the

00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:03,510
reason for that is that technical

00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:06,330
education is greater within the Asian

00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:09,270
American communities and so what that

00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:12,030
says is education can make a difference

00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:14,130
if we look at women is a different way

00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:16,650
of looking at diversity depending on

00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:18,059
which report you say you look at and

00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,700
where in the world you're looking at

00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:22,470
between in 10 and 30 percent even at

00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,169
thirty percent that's significantly less

00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:29,040
than the population so we have a problem

00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:31,320
in the IT industry as a whole and we've

00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,970
been aware of that for a long time we

00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,549
just have to look around this room and

00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:39,690
we see that there is an increasing level

00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:44,540
of diversity which is fantastic but it's

00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:47,130
not as diverse as it perhaps could be so

00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:48,419
what okay what can we do well in the

00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,130
short term there's things like the

00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:52,980
women's luncheon that is happening here

00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:54,570
so if if you're not aware of this this

00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,730
is happening tomorrow

00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:59,429
12 to 130 it's going to be on the

00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:00,509
seventeenth floor and I forget the name

00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:02,070
of the room it's going to be and I

00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:04,919
didn't have it when I set up these

00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:06,809
slides but they'll tell you on on

00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:08,399
reception there's no need to register

00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:12,480
for it although you do need to be a

00:22:08,399 --> 00:22:15,139
woman or at least identify as a woman I

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,120
think is the correct way of saying it

00:22:15,139 --> 00:22:21,330
the time it's really aimed at just being

00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,919
trying to connect on site ok it's about

00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:24,990
chatting about your engagement with the

00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:26,990
asf and any mutual interest is no

00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:31,139
presentations it's an informal meeting

00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:33,120
just to get together and chat ok so feel

00:22:31,139 --> 00:22:35,279
free to pop along to that if you want to

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,500
and if anything comes of that about how

00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:39,870
we can help with making women more

00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:43,440
welcome in this environment please let

00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:45,090
us know that's great for the short term

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,139
what about the long term what can we do

00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:52,049
looking further forward well less than 1

00:22:49,139 --> 00:22:54,000
percent of the AP exams 4 million AP

00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:57,090
exams taken in the US last year with a

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,649
computer science less than 1 percent so

00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:01,980
we're just not getting people into the

00:22:58,649 --> 00:23:05,220
industry only five to ten percent of us

00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,840
high schools teach computer science so

00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,789
again we're not getting people into the

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,490
industry remember the stat about Asian

00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:12,870
Americans because the education level

00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,879
was higher there was a better

00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:16,799
representation in fact a higher than the

00:23:14,879 --> 00:23:18,019
population representation of

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:22,139
asian-americans in the tech industry

00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:23,460
education is important education hits

00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:25,820
diversity in the industry and

00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:30,029
consequently hits diversity in the asf

00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:33,240
so what can we do about that well we're

00:23:30,029 --> 00:23:34,769
not here as a foundation to fix that

00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,139
problem we're here to produce software

00:23:34,769 --> 00:23:38,610
for the public good there's one thing

00:23:37,139 --> 00:23:40,289
that we can do straight white produce

00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:44,279
software for the public good that can be

00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:46,409
reused in classroom environments let's

00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:49,259
make it possible to reuse our software

00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:51,330
in class where classroom environments ok

00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:53,490
we're not educators we can't write

00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:56,009
course materials we're not paid to do

00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:57,960
that kind of thing but we are fantastic

00:23:56,009 --> 00:24:00,509
volunteers we have a huge range of

00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,750
fantastic volunteers who are willing to

00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:05,850
provide support not just because it's

00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:07,940
important for their job but because it's

00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:11,700
just the thing to do

00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:14,280
that's what we do as a foundation so I

00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:17,880
think that we can help our volunteers do

00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:20,670
more to help the education system within

00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:24,210
the within the world as a whole so I

00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:25,590
invited teals to come along to this

00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:28,830
event this stands for Technology

00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:30,480
education and literacy in schools this

00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,900
is a great organization it's a

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,670
grassroots organization these get in

00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:38,640
computer science into high schools they

00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:41,370
take people like me Anu and they show us

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,680
how to engage with teaching in high

00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:46,530
schools it's a very small investment of

00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:50,490
time on our part and the benefits get

00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:52,080
multiplied an unbelievable amount you

00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:54,630
get comments like this one from Michael

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,610
Brown a teacher who said we're taking

00:24:54,630 --> 00:25:00,930
the kids farther than I could have could

00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:02,790
have done alone now there's a volunteer

00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:07,380
a mentor works with this teacher maybe

00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:09,660
just for one term but after that term he

00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:13,950
can reproduce that year after year after

00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:15,930
year after year so the Linux Foundation

00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:17,730
have been very supportive of this idea

00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:20,010
they've given us a slot in the program

00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:21,570
which is later today at 5pm if you're

00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:23,580
interested in finding out more about how

00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:26,880
you can volunteer small amounts of time

00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:29,100
to help then please go along at 5pm if

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,440
you have a clash and you can't attend

00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:33,360
that session then there is a above

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,580
tomorrow a birds of a feather session

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,230
tomorrow evening and which you can

00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,760
attend and if you can't attend that you

00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:44,430
still have no excuse because there's a

00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:45,390
booth okay so please just go along find

00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:47,130
out what it's about there's no

00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:49,920
commitment but you might find that it's

00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:51,780
something you want to do the very least

00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,210
you can tell all the people that this

00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:57,180
organization exists and that we can make

00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:58,920
a huge difference and I wanted to

00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:01,080
quickly highlight this as well this is

00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,730
something that we as open source

00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:06,630
developers might want to get involved in

00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:10,380
is anybody seen code combat comm yeah a

00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:11,790
few people do you love it nobody's

00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,500
nobody's committing themselves at least

00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:15,810
one is committing themselves like so I

00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,370
love it it's fantastic what they're

00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:19,180
trying to do is get people to learn to

00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:21,690
program by playing the game

00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:25,510
this is what they're trying to achieve

00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:26,950
c'mon cyl your dinners going cold well

00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:29,080
hang on a minute mum I'm just going to

00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:30,160
finish this level what that means is

00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,590
they've got to finish the program

00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,540
they're writing because the program

00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:36,400
controls the character in the game that

00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,800
solves the problems at the character

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,860
faces you can use a number of different

00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:43,810
languages etc now I immediately see a

00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,760
problem with this I'm standing here

00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:47,410
talking about diversity and we've got to

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,420
stereotypes on the screen from this

00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:51,340
thing so let's change it now actually

00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:54,520
code combat isn't as bad as it looks

00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:57,640
here they do do a really good job of if

00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:59,950
involving everybody so there's loads of

00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:02,020
ways that you can you can get involved

00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:04,030
you can create levels you can create

00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,010
things for people to interact with or

00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:07,630
things as they call them you can write

00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:09,760
articles about how this can be useful

00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:12,880
think about this being applied to the

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,650
teals think fantastic and of course you

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,230
can contribute code it's an open source

00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:20,230
project that's driving this it's under

00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:21,490
the MIT license please go have a look at

00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:24,250
it and hopefully more people will be

00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:26,920
able to tweet things like this this was

00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:28,960
I tweeted a few days ago I'm a proud

00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:31,420
geek down to my 10 year old son just

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,150
issued his first pull request thanks to

00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:38,080
code combat who were also the recipient

00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:39,550
no this is fantastic if anybody have

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,740
your young kids my five-year-old

00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:43,150
daughter she loves the turtles game I

00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:45,340
forget the name of it now but there's a

00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:47,440
turtle's board game which teaches kind

00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,180
of turtle programming language she loves

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,680
it she wrote her first program doing

00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:55,300
that the other day fantastic tooling the

00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,730
last point of diversity that we should

00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,770
look at is geographic diversity this is

00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:01,960
a map of people who have identified

00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:03,520
where they live so committers who have

00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,050
identified where they live and we've got

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,320
a pretty good coverage we cover six

00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:10,780
continents it's really quite impressive

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,450
but when you zoom in to some places like

00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:15,310
China for example you know China is one

00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:18,160
of the most popular city of countries in

00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:21,060
the world it has some of the largest IT

00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:23,590
companies in the world yet it's so

00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:26,440
significantly under represented within

00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:28,240
the apache software foundation is this a

00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,340
problem what we're doing pretty well

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,690
without all of those contributors but

00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,290
imagine what we could do if we brought

00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,270
that

00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:38,110
expertise that different way of thinking

00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:41,920
into our communities so about a week ago

00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:45,760
and i went to china and i did a little

00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:48,430
bit of fact-finding this was at a

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:51,670
conference called OST see where i did a

00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:54,550
keynote and the the title of this

00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:56,620
conference was community / code and so I

00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:58,360
did an Apache way talk as a keynote and

00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:00,910
I talked about what community / code

00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:03,580
means to apache and I was amazed at the

00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:05,980
feedback I've got people just didn't

00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:08,520
comprehend what I was talking about you

00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:11,230
know it was totally new to these people

00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:13,870
unlike the people in this room where for

00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:16,810
many of us it's second nature now it's

00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:18,610
completely new I went to a lot of

00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:21,460
smaller meetup groups i think i did five

00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:23,320
or six in total i went to linux user

00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:26,590
groups this is a group called karen chef

00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,690
which is a group promoting open source

00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:30,730
true open source the way we think of it

00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:34,660
not not just slapping a license on it

00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:36,820
and saying there you go and I found the

00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,800
same thing the young people who are

00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:40,660
coming through education in that country

00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,390
are fascinated by what's happening in

00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:45,280
the West around open source and how it

00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:49,150
differs from what's happening in China

00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:52,480
around open source I conducted a bunch

00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:55,180
of media interviews this was a five

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,550
members of the media and same results

00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:59,620
they were where they were telling me

00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:01,780
that their readers are desperate for

00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:05,080
this kind of information they want to

00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:06,720
understand how can they as a country not

00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,250
just as individuals but as a country

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,070
engage with Western open source and

00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:13,870
bring Western Westerners to Chinese open

00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:17,980
source now there's obviously problems

00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:20,110
with this language is a barrier we can

00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:22,330
we can address those problems in various

00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:25,300
ways but the biggest problem is probably

00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:27,580
culture and we assume that everybody

00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:31,270
understands what we're talking about but

00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:33,130
honestly the IP the copyright laws the

00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:35,080
respective copyright laws in China are

00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:38,050
so different to how they are here I

00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:41,980
didn't have a clue how different until I

00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:43,180
went out there my boss who actually sent

00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,980
me to China was there

00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:48,100
work trips this was all stuff that I did

00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:49,420
on the side he describes China is not

00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:53,050
just a different country but a different

00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:54,970
world and it is all the assumptions that

00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:57,550
we have all those ideas that we have

00:30:54,970 --> 00:31:00,730
here in the West don't apply when we

00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:02,830
start thinking about China so what can

00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:04,510
we do about this well the first and most

00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:06,160
obvious thing we can do is talk to the

00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:07,930
Chinese companies who are working with

00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,820
apache software so Ali barber is a

00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:11,920
company I've been talking with for about

00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:15,250
a year and I originally approached them

00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:18,160
because of this jay storm project which

00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:20,650
is a fork of Apache stone and they've

00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,000
reimplemented a lot of it in Java and

00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:24,160
I've been talking to you know why don't

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,160
you come and work with the community

00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,680
here it would be better for everybody oh

00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:32,110
we can't do that because we're using

00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,700
Java and they're written enclosure we

00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:36,370
can't do that because this we can't do

00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,020
that because that and I've been talking

00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:39,700
to them gently over the course of about

00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,260
a year to see how we can resolve this

00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,790
and I sat down with them whilst I was in

00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:46,960
China and the first thing they showed me

00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:51,270
was this issue in an Apache storm issue

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:53,740
tracker about bringing it back to Apache

00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:55,000
now this is a really good example if

00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:57,220
there's anybody here from the Apache

00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,430
storm p.m. see you guys are doing an

00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:02,230
amazing job these people have

00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:03,790
reimplemented the code in a different

00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:05,590
language and they're still having the

00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:07,330
conversation about bringing it back in

00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,310
and learning from that expertise and

00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:11,410
looking at what difference it can make

00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:14,050
to the community into the project as a

00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:16,000
whole and we as projects need to do more

00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:18,250
of this not just for China I'm for China

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,100
up there because I've been to China and

00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:22,540
I've talked to people you don't have to

00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,340
go to China's to do it these people are

00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,830
perfectly willing to come towards the

00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,630
language barrier is not a problem well

00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:30,940
it's a problem it's a language barrier

00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:34,570
but they're willing to talk to us in

00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:37,150
English okay our problem is spending the

00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:38,680
time to understand what it is that

00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:40,960
they're saying to us and why they're

00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:42,580
taking the position that they do now

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,710
I've spoken to lots of people who are

00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:46,630
engaged with various things in China

00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:48,220
lots of members I've got lots of

00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:50,290
volunteers who said yeah we really want

00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:54,460
to make a difference on this a few years

00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:56,140
ago back in 2009 2010 we had the apache

00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:59,120
road show

00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:01,880
which was in Shanghai and China and I

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,140
think we went to Sri Lanka as well I've

00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,150
been asked by a number of people

00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:07,100
including Karen sure which was the group

00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:09,920
photo that I put in up there about can

00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:12,200
we do that again can we take an Apache

00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,750
Roadshow to China so if anybody is

00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,060
interested in doing that please reach

00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:19,670
out to me and let's see what we can do

00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:21,680
and rich I hope you can I can't say no

00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:26,540

we're all about building that community

00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:39,620
so we can produce fantastic code and by

00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:43,580
way of credits here's all our top level

00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:45,170

00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:48,950
put the sub-projects up there cause I've

00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:51,710
run running at a time so I just want to
