I'm here really to talk about two things

00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:05,819
I'm going to be talking about project

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,230
geode which is something we're going to

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,450
be announcing and talking about quite a

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,870
bit of the show today the second item is

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:16,130
the open data platform and we started

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:19,400
this conversation back in February and

00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:21,750
wire came out with a nice article around

00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,720
changing the software world this is news

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,990
to most of the world but old hat to this

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,029
room I think this room is very deep into

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,399
open source and one of the things i

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,110
think that's i'd like to convey is this

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,960
is much bigger than pivotal this is not

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,430
a pivotal thing geode will talk about

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,050
how that sort of brings in memory

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,760
technology into open source will talk

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,620
about the Open Data Platform some of its

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,870
goals but it really is bigger than

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,059
pivotal and I'm lucky in my job in that

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,559
I get a work beyond pivotal I worked

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:51,420
really closely with most of our

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,090
competitors and our sales guys hate that

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,379
but the industry benefits from that and

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,090
that's really some of the agendas we

00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,199
drive out last year I spend most of my

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,629
time working on the cloud foundry

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:02,670
foundation we got chip coming up next to

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,820
talk a little bit about that what's much

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,530
bigger than pivotal hmm but it is change

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,750
and I want to take you guys quickly

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,490
through sort of what it's like outside

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,140
of this world when you talk about things

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,720
like open sourcing your products or

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,759
creating new foundations and what comes

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,250
first is this idea of change and people

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,380
start to sort of get panicky right they

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,780
think about wool this is different and

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,000
the reason they do that is people are

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,770
people right my friend playing ping pong

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,240
here is whacking down a million

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,759
different ideas and telling us why it's

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,290
a bad idea to go open source and talking

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,930
about sort of defending where they're

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,369
coming from right they bring out the P&L

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,439
and they show you how much revenue these

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,180
proprietary products bring or they they

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,649
bring out sort of the bullying tactics

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,899
to tell you Oh will only work with you

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,579
if you work in these particular ways but

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,710
in the way in the end that's really sort

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:53,340
of a path to the museum of ancient

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,990
history so staying at status quo is

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,460
really no longer an option for the

00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,780
industry and as people go through this

00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,939
they learn this right you guys have been

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,320
doing this for a long time but folks

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,329
like me that are more on the business

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,880
side or our enterprise customers this is

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,690
radical ideas to them but in the end

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,790
they know open source is the standard

00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:13,440
customers are asking us to do this folks

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,020
are making sure we do it correctly

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,790
and we're doing our best and I want to

00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,460
start with a product that used to be

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:24,030
known as Jim fire Jim fire was a

00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:26,310
technology developed many years ago

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,260
brought into vmware then into pivotal

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,830
and now something does the first thing

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,570
we're bringing out of our closed source

00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:36,240
into open source and Jim fire is a

00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,340
pretty amazing product some numbers I'll

00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,040
throw at you 17 billion records in

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,530
memory so GE one of our customers is

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,650
running Jim fire at scale this is huge

00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,480
scale one analogy is if you had 17

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,660
billion dollars that's about one

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,870
trillion indian rupees so big numbers

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,940
lots of scale we also do lots of i/o so

00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,370
we talked about China and sort of the

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,170
population there are 4.6 million

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:04,080
transactions per day and they're in

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:07,140
their rail system run over project geo

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,300
today originally Jim fire was about

00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,670
forty thousand per second and then

00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,370
lastly a big insurance provider running

00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:16,830
23 application so lots of diversity and

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,540
the workloads it can handle we're

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,640
introducing it today it's entering the

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,709
Apache Incubator under the term geode

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,940
lots of presentations we'll talk a bit

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:26,700
about that but I encourage you to take a

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,500
look at geo that's really interesting my

00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,320
second point is around the open data

00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,910
platform which is an industry effort

00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,380
we'll talk a lot about this in the

00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,810
coming months but it's really about him

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,880
in advancing the state of big data and

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,130
open source in the industry we have lots

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,870
of members I'm proud to announce today

00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,060
that we're introducing a silver

00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,500
membership tier so this will enable us

00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,300
to bring in folks is a little as a

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,709
thousand dollars thousand-dollar sounds

00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,420
like a lot but that's pretty much the

00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:53,519
cost of doing paperwork and paying

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,959
attorneys and dealing with finance folks

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,239
and these sorts of things so it so in

00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,690
effect a very low cost membership to

00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,489
drive lots of usage into it our goal is

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:06,090
to accelerate and deliver Big Data

00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:08,519
technologies for the enterprise and a

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,650
lot of actions going on already in today

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,880
inside of ODP so we've formed a number

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,470
of working groups we started thinking

00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,300
about governance we started thinking

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,799
about the community there's an

00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,000
interesting one called Apache assist

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,590
which I'll talk about here in a minute

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,750
we're looking at how do we fund

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:24,539
universities how do we enable education

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,310
programs how do we drive University

00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:27,930
certifications etc

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,639
we really want to provide a model that

00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,370
works really well with existing open

00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:34,410
source we believe it's a hundred percent

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,050
complimentary to asf we think we can

00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:39,090
help asf in a number of ways a couple

00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,639
quick examples my friend Roman here is

00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:43,230
putting on a the apache way so that to

00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,270
help new contributors come into your

00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,770
group it is a little overwhelming when

00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,480
you face some of your mailing lists and

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,460
working practices so we're helping the

00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,340
industry understand that we're rallying

00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:56,400
teams together to solve for big bugs

00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:58,080
those sorts of issues 12 seconds left so

00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,639
guiding principles I once spent a lot of

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,950
time on I do want to point out one

00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,350
member one vote we've been sort of

00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,910
bashed by some of those that are fearful

00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,770
of what we're doing around sort of

00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,930
closed source or dollars but we really

00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:13,889
are an open community and we invite you

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:16,290
to come join us two more call-outs I

00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:17,580
want a more information around project G

00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,860
of there's a getting started lab

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,620
tomorrow and then two presentations on

00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,750
Wednesday and then lastly a couple other

00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,950
pivotal presentations call out to Roman

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,960
who will be talking a little bit about

00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,610
incubation and then the hardest working

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,930
guy in cloud foundry mark matt stein

00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,000
will take you through that information

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:36,800
with that look forward to talking to you

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,800
