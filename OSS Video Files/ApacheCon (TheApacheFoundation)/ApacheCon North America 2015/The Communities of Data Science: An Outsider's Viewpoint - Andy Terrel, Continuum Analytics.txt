happy tax day no that's I do realize

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,340
that I am the last talk between free

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:12,719
beer so I will try to take as long as

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,580
possible so I'm here to talk about the

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,710
communities of data sciences data

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,980
science and I kind of titled it an

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,960
Apache con outsider's view point and

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,900
I'll tell you a little bit about why and

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,220
how I got there but this slides mostly

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,769
for the internet because they'd like to

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,900
know who's talking but find me on

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,769
Twitter like rich mentioned my

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,590
backgrounds in high-performance

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:36,570
computing doing things in the finance

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,550
industry web data lots of kind of

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,460
different places wherever wherever data

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,829
goes if you will to give you kind of

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,559
some perspective on where I come from

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,420
and the things I've done I used to solve

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,940
problems like this where you take math

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,760
equations and turn it into a very simple

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,850
1d model and then compute on very large

00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,000
scaled out scaled up systems somebody

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,260
asked if if it how many people had 100

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,270
no clusters well I actually had a

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,339
hundred thousand no clusters so we did

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,470
but I don't expect everybody to get to

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:09,689
work with those things but the ultimate

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,880
goal was to do something like predicts

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:14,430
hurricane sandy and we actually pretty

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,560
highly predicted like where surge water

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,040
and things like that way that was my

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,780
academic life and upon the data science

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,820
revolution and new startups and things

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,490
like that I've actually moved over to

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,220
something a little bit more like this

00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:31,290
we're taking in so taking an

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,820
unstructured text off the web and lots

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:38,280
of free open data and I actually googled

00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:40,829
Hadoop supercomputer and I got this guy

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,649
so you can scale the heck out of it but

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,720
not so much scaled up sometimes and

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,869
we're working on machine learning

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,360
classifiers and actual like machine

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:53,720
learning algorithms that while on their

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,189
face of it look very different from the

00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,689
fluid dynamics there are actually a lot

00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:59,700
of the same math a lot of the same

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:02,280
underlying linear algebra used in that

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,399
first domain is used in machine learning

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,110
and our application axes I work with the

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,759
one of the major applications I work

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,310
with us to helping find human

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,680
trafficking victims and

00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,450
and helping the defense agency help with

00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:19,030
the human trafficking crisis is going on

00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:22,250
throughout the world but why am I here

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,410
I'm here because as you notice the two

00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,810
kind of viewpoints of the worlds I

00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:29,180
worked in were very different and I got

00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,620
met this man Chris madman and I had to

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,940
go find a picture with his chest hair

00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,910
just so everybody makes sure they

00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,650
recognize who he is

00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:39,739
so I'm from Texas

00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:42,650
he's from Southern California I work on

00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:45,500
worked on supercomputers and simulation

00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:49,130
he worked in and in the scientific

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,709
community with HPC he works on big

00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:54,140
computers with Apache and search engine

00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:57,680
technology let's just say we had a lot

00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:59,239
to argue about and so at the end of the

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,799
day we kind of like well what is like

00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:03,440
what is the thing that brings us as

00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:06,250
communities together because as data

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,630
science is becoming a huge kind of

00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:11,540
multiplier and businesses and everyday

00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:14,030
life these communities are clashing in

00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:17,000
major ways and and there's things we can

00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:19,579
learn from each other ultimately I

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,459
really like drew Conway and John and

00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:25,430
watt miles White's thin diagram of what

00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:27,430
data science is it's kind of this

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,290
mismatch of hacking skills math

00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:34,100
statistics knowledge and some expertise

00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:36,560
in some field and unfortunately a lot of

00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,780
us work in that danger zone of like not

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,549
really wanting to get down into the math

00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,680
and statistics of it but like just

00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:44,540
shoving code out on data and saying hey

00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,910
look we've got some picture to show or

00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:49,489
some visualization but then kind of come

00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,900
away from here is that there's other

00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:52,639
communities out there that have the same

00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,980
sort of idea like the computational

00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:57,139
science community from HPC it's the same

00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,420
when I went to grad school it was

00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:01,819
instead of substantive expertise it was

00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,579
physics and hacking skills was computer

00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:05,389
science and databases and math and math

00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:07,310
is everywhere

00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:08,959
of course saying you do math is a little

00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:13,489
bit like saying you drink an ocean I

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:16,190
mean it's just too much right so but

00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:19,459
from that I have a community called numb

00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:21,229
focus spelled with n um with all capital

00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:23,960
focus just to make sure nobody can get

00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:25,520
it right and we have one goal

00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,900
that's to sustain open science through

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,449
open code and so there's our little logo

00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,550
open code better science and we actually

00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:35,870
have a lot of respect for the Apache

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,690
foundation because you guys have been

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,889
doing this for a long time and our

00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,560
community's a little bit different from

00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:44,509
you guys and we just did things set

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,669
things up just a tiny bit different and

00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:48,650
I'm here to talk a little bit about what

00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:50,180
we did different why we like in some of

00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,699
the challenges that we've faced in

00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:54,889
setting up our communities and kind of

00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:56,750
and afterwards I'm definitely interested

00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:57,800
anybody's opinions on the things I say

00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,800
because I'm going to present a lot of

00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,660
challenges not a lot of solutions so

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,190
what does gnome focus do we have our

00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,960
projects I'll show you our projects page

00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:08,479
we don't have nearly as many projects as

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,580
Apache we're trying to keep small into

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,530
the data science world we do education

00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,780
and fellowships we have a lot of women

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:16,639
and Technology events we strongly

00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,710
believe that if you don't include half

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:23,680
of our population in code you are not

00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:28,639
someone we want to work with thank you I

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,800
think I think a big thing we do is just

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,630
help people understand the money side of

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,139
things and I'll explain a little bit why

00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,520
that's so important for our communities

00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:39,979
and and then we have a conference series

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,039
called PI data which is got like I think

00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:45,440
eight conferences a year now here are a

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,120
few of the codes that we work with these

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,919
are all our fiscally sponsored codes we

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,870
have a long list of codes that we do

00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:53,630
other things with they primarily come

00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:57,590
from the Python ecosystem but we've

00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:59,270
branched out into our and Julia and any

00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:02,419
one kind of work with we have at least

00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:03,830
two of these up here data carpentry and

00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:07,130
software carpentry which are purely

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:09,650
educational and so an insight which is a

00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:12,440
block a podcast system and things like

00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:14,990
that so definitely come check us out on

00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,789
our web page and we have a lot of codes

00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,469
and we're trying to help people go go

00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:20,419
forward and here's kind of some of the

00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:22,639
people that made it happen as our board

00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:25,370
members and our executive directors from

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:29,870
industry academia government labs and so

00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:31,849
kind of a whole range of folks so let's

00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,880
kind of fast forward to kind of the bulk

00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:37,279
of my talk so I come from a community

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,790
you guys have a community we have

00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,070
different way

00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,720
of doing things but as far as like

00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,120
things go we approach challenges a

00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,620
little bit differently and the first

00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,990
kind of challenge is I want to go

00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,520
through three challenges that we have as

00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,040
a community of seeing and are trying to

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,920
address and I'm definitely very

00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,210
interested in anybody's opinion on how

00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,960
they address them differently and things

00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:01,250
like that so our first challenge is

00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,440
keeping code alive

00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:06,020
I think Apache is probably the only

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,390
foundation I've seen around code that

00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,460
has a really well-defined process of

00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:12,080
going from top level projects to

00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:16,640
incubator projects and so on and so

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,560
forth but for us it's it's not only just

00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,140
a matter of like telling people how to

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,910
build the code it's actually explaining

00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,770
to them that what happens if your code

00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:27,770
doesn't isn't maintained because

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,990
remember a diverse like only compute the

00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,820
code was only one third of those circles

00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,810
or that Venn diagram of both communities

00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,660
that come from

00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,280
and so if code is kind of thought of as

00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,570
the side project it's like someone that

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,500
just gets to work then it's not nearly

00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:45,770
respected enough to actually maintain

00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:48,200
and I think a lot of people you give

00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,850
them the analogy of a house you go live

00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,340
in a house you fix up that house you

00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:54,020
constantly work in that house and for

00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,470
people who haven't ever owned a house I

00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:59,000
got to have this pleasure of now owning

00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:01,610
my own home for the last two years and

00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,040
I'm trying to figure out how to not own

00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:06,680
my home anymore

00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:08,330
if you want anything to stop it so for

00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:12,370
you actually working on your open-source

00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:15,170
project my house does it perfectly so

00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:17,270
while we as coders know that bit rot is

00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:20,750
very real and that it codes us not

00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:23,120
maintained will not be a be as

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,830
functional in 50 years as it is today

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,720
and those are like a lot of the codes

00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:29,390
we're using a data science like the the

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,890
blahs and Linlin linear algebra lay

00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:33,349
plaque and things like that they're

00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:36,020
actually on the order of 50 euro cold

00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:37,610
codes so don't think that like the

00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,960
things we're doing today are not going

00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,900
to exist for 50 years

00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,760
in fact the chips the machines the the

00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:46,760
ways we actually wire things together

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,290
the that stuff's all changed but the

00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,150
code is state stuck around for like

00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,450
these 50 years and so when we think

00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,520
about our community

00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,200
we really do need to think of that 50 to

00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,959
100 year kind of like how do we go

00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,029
forward and then but today there's

00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:01,950
perhaps even more of a crisis so people

00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:03,720
aren't thinking about the code and then

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,430
where do the people go so where are the

00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,830
people going who built this code and

00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:13,020
that's become probably the biggest

00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:14,940
challenge for science is keeping people

00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:18,420
in the field to do data science for

00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:20,730
science itself and so traditionally

00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,529
there's been all kinds of four different

00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,630
areas where people have gone those

00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:26,339
people have built those class codes

00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,830
we've used for the 50 years from

00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:30,060
universities to the Department of Energy

00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,190
the Department of Energy actually funds

00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,839
a lot of code I think that pretty much

00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:36,810
everyone here is using code on their

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,029
laptop the department energy is built to

00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,580
things like observe observations like

00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:44,310
here I have a picture of a I think the

00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,779
chilean telescope and I know lots of

00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:48,029
people at telescopes and lots of people

00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:49,620
like CERN and and Fermilab and like

00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:51,360
around instruments because to keep their

00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,910
instruments up and running they have to

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,010
have the code and maintain codes then

00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:58,350
there's also places like that help

00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:00,089
scientists work on their codes from like

00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,890
a perspective of like a supercomputing

00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:03,779
Center our supercomputing centers

00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:06,600
there's a met some folks here from

00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:08,459
exceed are super huge things are doing

00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,250
an amazing job of hiring lots of coders

00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:12,630
to help scientists still write code and

00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,690
keep it running on these big machines

00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:17,430
and it's not is it's not a glamorous job

00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:20,540
these none of these places are places

00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:23,220
that you know you think of on CSI or

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:25,680
making the big waves and Silicon Valley

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:29,670
investor decks and things like that and

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,680
then there's this massive kind of army

00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:34,320
of people called postdocs who do a lot

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,540
of work and get paid very little and

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,329
that's is also a problem if we depend

00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,270
upon paying people very little in order

00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:45,750
to do some of our most critical research

00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:48,329
so that's backwards so all of these

00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:50,100
places have their limits and they've

00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:52,610
kind of hit them and what we're finding

00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,990
in science is most people are doing this

00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,640
they're finding out that the Google bus

00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:59,540
is going to pay them more give them

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,020
better problems and and get them into

00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,880
career paths

00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:06,520
perhaps that

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,840
are more amenable to their way of life

00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,670
of actually working on the code

00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,530
maintaining the code understanding so

00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:13,660
there are companies that understand code

00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:16,540
is very important so one of the

00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:18,070
challenges is definitely keeping those

00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,340
people who go to those companies still

00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:22,360
engaged in the community and

00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:25,030
contributing back to the community and

00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,220
making sure that we as a people can

00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:30,250
still work in the science codes that we

00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:32,140
we appreciate we can still get back and

00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,880
I think that Apache one of the reasons

00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,380
I'm super excited heating here is that

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,450
Apaches one of the few organizations

00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:41,620
does that so well

00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:43,330
very few kinds of organizations do as

00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,790
good a job at getting commercial

00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:50,920
entities giving back code as Apache does

00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:53,170
and there's lots of reasons why but even

00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,060
so in this kind of structure where

00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,590
people are doing different things not

00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,200
everybody agrees that code is the most

00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:01,600
important thing it's become very

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,150
difficult to actually build out the

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,890
kinds of projects we need the legal

00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:09,310
structure between organizations are much

00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:11,500
different and academic funding is

00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:13,540
getting much tighter I mean it's it's

00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,430
very easy for a graduate student or a

00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,900
postdoc to start a new project but it's

00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,480
very hard for them to maintain that

00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:23,170
project pasts they're kind of initial

00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:25,690
years of learning and so this kind of

00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:27,880
flow between the scientific software

00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:30,460
writers and and the data science writers

00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:34,030
and that build this community and being

00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:36,730
thrown out or often going to companies

00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:38,260
that don't allow them to give back to to

00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:40,450
the open source world it's kind of

00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:43,390
causing a lot of constraints of what we

00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:45,580
can do as a society for data science on

00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:47,890
a whole and I think that it's some

00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,930
problem we need to kind of address as a

00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,220
community and say hey we need to make

00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,420
sure that when we go back to our

00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,550
companies when we go back to our

00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,710
institutions that code is important

00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:59,920
enough that we have to give back and it

00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:02,700
has to be a big deal to give you an

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,050
example my good friends at the ipython

00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:08,410
ipython project how many people have

00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:10,660
heard of ipython awesome the rest of you

00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:12,790
guys start googling now stop listening

00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,360
to me start googling ipython it'll

00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,269
change your life

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,389
I python is become so

00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:21,910
interesting that like and pretty much

00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:23,649
every kind of big data science vendor

00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,480
out there is using ipython notebook and

00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:28,720
they're using ipython through everything

00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,009
they do it links up many different types

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,079
of codes I think they have like 50

00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:35,559
different languages and things like that

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:37,779
they can run in the framework and it's

00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:39,069
become such a big deal that nature the

00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:41,110
nature magazine actually has

00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:43,869
publications built on top of this net

00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:46,480
this notebook and so now scientists are

00:13:43,869 --> 00:13:48,610
able to intermingle both their their

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,350
pros and their code into the same

00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,839
document and serve it up on the web I

00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:55,689
mean Don Knuth thought of this many

00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:57,639
years ago it's actually very much alive

00:13:55,689 --> 00:14:00,429
today and the science community is

00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:03,420
moving very close to this kind of

00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:07,119
interactive literate programming style

00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:09,850
but ipython is while it might look like

00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:13,360
just a publishing kind of idea it's a

00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:15,850
very big system and the team is actually

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,929
spread out quite widely it's on two

00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,959
continents with four academic

00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:21,699
institutions and several companies just

00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:25,329
getting the people together to pay for

00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:26,829
things is is very challenging and if you

00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:28,809
go through the normal academic channels

00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:29,980
they the people who actually work on the

00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:33,670
project probably only see about 30

00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:36,490
percent of that money nothing against

00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:38,589
our academic institutions or the legal

00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,329
structures we have set up today but I

00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:43,119
just don't think that's acceptable that

00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:45,189
like going in and doing the most

00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:47,999
important work in my mind of getting our

00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:52,649
community together and sharing code gets

00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:55,600
gets chopped down so much and so and

00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:57,490
once you go to that level of if you give

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,319
money to the organizations that are

00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,639
building the future and it gets chopped

00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:03,490
down about 30% how are they going to

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,990
compete on keeping the salaries of the

00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:07,299
companies need in order to keep

00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:09,879
contributing and so that's effectively

00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:11,439
why gnome focus was born so the data

00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:13,990
files we found the data science

00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:16,569
community is a very diverse set of jobs

00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:19,240
it's not just coders it's not just

00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:21,850
mathematicians it's not just any one

00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:25,929
specific field so we need they have to

00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:29,740
be a variety of options to grow and

00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:30,300
learn inside that community the open

00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,790
code

00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,320
have kind of like if you want to run an

00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,600
open code project and have a lot of

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,070
impact there's this kind of stair our

00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,410
projects out there that very

00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,640
well-established if one person's come

00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:44,160
out with a big thing and it's gone

00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,840
really well but once you go beyond that

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,630
and to maintain that you have to be able

00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,130
to handle this complexity the legal

00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,720
structures to get money into the

00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,960
organization so you can so your

00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,610
developers can eat I mean so that you

00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,880
can keep servers running and everything

00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:01,710
like that so numb focus one of the

00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,350
challenges we kind of set out to say is

00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:06,390
we need to come back together and solve

00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:07,860
this idea of like who's working on the

00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:11,480
code maintaining code and making it a

00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,480
first-class citizen and everything we do

00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:16,500
so enough on that one

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,660
challenge - I think this one is kind of

00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:24,750
beating a dead horse making codes usable

00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:26,460
legally I think Apache is is a good has

00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,800
a good community and a good record for

00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,660
showing this but I'll just kind of throw

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,080
it up here for folks who've maybe nets I

00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:35,760
tell my story around making the legality

00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,970
and then code licensing and things like

00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:42,030
that so I started off in an academia and

00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:43,770
the viewpoint and very early on was well

00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,240
you make your code GPL because you don't

00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:47,450
want somebody making money out of it

00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,700
without you getting gaining from that

00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:52,260
which at the face of is like yeah we're

00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,360
going to keep a community that's away

00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:58,410
from that aspect and everybody has to

00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,910
give back to us but very quickly you

00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:02,850
learned what we'll wait a minute like

00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:05,280
the government pays me to do innovation

00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:07,110
into my code and then I'm telling the

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,630
everybody else that they have to play by

00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:12,120
my rules and overuse my code it became

00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:14,580
kind of a strain kind of personally for

00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,440
that and we also also found that like

00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:19,230
more or less people just didn't have

00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:23,550
like you would just have get less users

00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:26,100
on the on in my particular field because

00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:27,990
of that GPL and so often I so I have a

00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,510
lot of code out for the GPL has very

00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:32,490
bought into it and and believe in it

00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,650
wholeheartedly but at the end of the day

00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,450
like I feel like if science is coming

00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,040
science wants to succeed it needs to be

00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:40,710
free for everyone and that means ever

00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:44,940
any even companies that want to innovate

00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:48,930
and go further I try to use the Apache

00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:51,240
License but Apaches license wasn't as

00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:53,250
accepted at universities at the time I

00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,580
think patent indemnification University

00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,600
still don't quite understand that you

00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:02,220
know software patents are not

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,710
necessarily the best idea and they they

00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,480
don't understand that software patent

00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:09,150
indemnification so like the only option

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,420
I really had was using MIT or bsd-style

00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:14,040
license which is this is okay I mean

00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,710
like and that's largely where our

00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:18,900
communities kind of focused on now we

00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:21,000
get into arguments about can you do two

00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,040
or three claws and then you get to see

00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,840
the legal department try to count and oh

00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:30,420
that is brilliant so MIT or BSD happens

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,400
quite a bit and inside at least the the

00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,620
scientific Python community because of

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,270
all these tensions that come along now I

00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,980
come back and I look at it from a

00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:40,410
corporate side now being part of a

00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:43,560
start-up and I see hey look at how much

00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:45,750
more interest there is from the

00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,210
commercial segment because of that

00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,870
patent identification clause in a in a

00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,600
lv2

00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:54,330
and I told Chris before I came out here

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,410
he had to turn off his al v2 bot I don't

00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:59,430
know if you guys have ever gotten this

00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:03,650
but now he tagged all my code is ALV - I

00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:06,720
love the guy but you know there's limits

00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:09,180
so so more or less like I think

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,680
everybody has a story somewhere along

00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:13,410
the lines of like figuring out what this

00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,970
license stuff is going on and one thing

00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:16,200
that you know foundations and

00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:19,440
communities can do is kind of help

00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,940
target around what what licenses to use

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,140
like I talked to a lot of people me our

00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,030
community and you ask well why are you

00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,650
using GPL and their answer is like well

00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,660
that's what they my community used and

00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:30,420
there's no reason to switch but that's

00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,640
kind of not true anymore because that's

00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,380
why python is often take is is said to

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,940
be taking off as a data science language

00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,530
because there's a lot of people who are

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:43,470
much more willing to use that in release

00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:45,900
code that way so code licensing was

00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:48,930
actually the easy problem data is the

00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,790
hard problem and I don't know of a good

00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:53,460
solution I know what people do I know

00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:55,530
the patterns some people will you know

00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:58,830
give you in DA's design some P

00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:00,240
we'll pass big laws like HIPAA and I

00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,800
mean HIPAA is actually just a set of

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,750
laws to scare you into not doing

00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,500
anything I mean like that's my view of

00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:08,640
it

00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:10,980
I love lawyers I do and then there's

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,270
people who like air-gap systems I being

00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,070
in the commercial world now I've learned

00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,420
what air-gap systems are and I was like

00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,290
so the sort of things like yeah I've

00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,400
worked on some of the largest

00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,470
supercomputers in the world I don't

00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,510
consider that like what I want to spend

00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,340
my life doing but it's all out for this

00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:24,990
problem sharing your data and we have

00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:28,230
actionable insight on your data where we

00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:31,250
have personal data personal attributes

00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:33,840
and data how do you kind of work on that

00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:38,030
and the final kind of challenge is

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:40,590
keeping code interoperable I think that

00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:42,420
this one is one that a lot of people

00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,490
don't kind of realize until they start

00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,630
getting into the big data world because

00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,400
once you start using some of the

00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:50,790
traditional means of just calling out

00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:53,550
from the JVM so serializing to a C code

00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:54,810
and back or through a restful api you're

00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,970
actually leaving a lot of things on a

00:20:54,810 --> 00:21:00,090
table and so while it's been the case

00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:01,350
that restful api is and serialization

00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:04,320
and things like that techniques work

00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:06,390
really well for small data codes they

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:10,680
don't work so well once you get to to

00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:13,590
bigger size in fact I love this paper by

00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:15,990
Kathleen Fisher and company on the next

00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:20,790
700 descript data description languages

00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:23,340
that's like really we need 700 more but

00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:25,680
is it so the data has become the big

00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:27,780
operating system of today this is how we

00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:30,600
exchange almost everything we do through

00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:32,760
some simple restful api or through files

00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,650
exchanged and things like that and so

00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,320
being able to talk about data in a very

00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:40,680
smart way has become a huge topic in

00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:42,720
academia but also who fuels a lot of

00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,760
fights between proto protobufs versus

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,730
thrift versus Avro and all that sort of

00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,470
thing as well but there's also kind of

00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,300
something else going on as well and I

00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,560
think we see in this conference a lot of

00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,940
containers coming along and there's this

00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,400
kind of viewpoint of like containers

00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,870
versus install so my company produces an

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,380
open-source product called anaconda

00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,520
which just helps people install stuff

00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,840
and makes it very easy for you to

00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,390
install stuff and then we also use

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,460
docker a lot because installing other

00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:09,240
people's software is the most pain you

00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,650
will ever face and

00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:15,660
life well now it's not so bad because we

00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:17,640
have docker but this whole idea of a

00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,140
container versus an installer if you're

00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,600
working with a supercomputing community

00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:24,060
where they don't want any other process

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,190
going on during their there their profit

00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,630
during their jobs

00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:30,420
I mean I've literally had people tell me

00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:31,920
I didn't get every single megabyte of

00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:35,040
memory I had in my terabyte memory

00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,600
system and and did these people do exist

00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:40,260
so there is this kind of contention of

00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:43,290
how do you solve that sort of problem to

00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:46,370
this end in one and and one of the DARPA

00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:49,910
contracts we had we have I think we have

00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:54,090
17 groups of quote big data solutions

00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:56,010
including things like spark and a repay

00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:58,140
which is an R on Hadoop thing and things

00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:59,880
like that and the the the big question

00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,280
came how do you actually make these

00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:05,130
codes work together when they have

00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,500
completely separate stacks and you

00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,240
listen to young Stoica talk about the

00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,490
berkeley data stack is like one stack to

00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,980
solve all the problems that's a very CS

00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:15,450
viewpoint of how to solve a problem I'm

00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,770
just gonna build a new system you're

00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,210
gonna get on my boat and you're gonna be

00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:21,540
able to do everything well for me and

00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:23,160
it's gonna work right so we built a

00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:25,890
little code that was going to call out

00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:29,820
to the common crawl and do a lot of

00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:31,200
graph analytics with these I think the

00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:34,230
end of the day it was like ended up

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:38,490
being seven different languages but this

00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:40,890
is the the X cross language solution we

00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:43,110
came up with when we step back and we

00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:44,550
ask what did we actually do we're

00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:47,280
actually built a database that was

00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:50,040
exposed you you have effectively got

00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,630
records from this controller you avoided

00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,480
the JVM as much as possible

00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:59,670
levy Java guys but please stop moving my

00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:01,560
memory but so you actually we had people

00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:03,000
who Oh like in an ownership model for

00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,950
where the data came from it and so on

00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,340
and so forth it turns out it's a little

00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:10,470
bit of a nightmare to use okay but it

00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,180
was the only way we knew how to actually

00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:14,520
get all these programs together so once

00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:17,760
again it came back to let's stop

00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,350
thinking about exact semantics of data

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,790
and go back and think about where is my

00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,260
memory what how do I describe that

00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,330
memory

00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:25,370
I passed a description over and actually

00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:28,130
get these codes working together I think

00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:31,220
that more and more the communities

00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:32,870
inside data science are there's more

00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,640
codes coming out in more languages and

00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:36,620
getting those things interoperable is a

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,930
very important very critical piece of

00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:42,860
going forward and being able to use each

00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:45,830
other's work so that's my three kind of

00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:48,800
basic challenges that I see I could go

00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:51,470
on and on but Chris Chris told me not to

00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,930
tell you how fast MPI is and how much I

00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:57,230
love Python and that sort of thing so

00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:58,820
I'll stop here but I think a few

00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:00,530
observations especially for people who

00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:02,630
are just coming into the field or who

00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:06,140
want to be inside the data science world

00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:07,970
it's like keeping your keeping code and

00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,950
process open to new forms that can be

00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:13,160
collaboration a contribution is very

00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:14,600
important data science is a very hard

00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,310
discipline there's a lot of open

00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,020
problems a lot a lot of the low-hanging

00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:20,210
fruit has been picked off but there's

00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:21,950
still grand challenges out there as we

00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:26,240
see the Internet of Things come on and

00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:27,890
we see just people using data to make

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,020
all their business decisions I think

00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:32,060
that there is a it's it's a very ripe

00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:35,120
field to get into and learn about but

00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:36,980
it's also one of the hardest places to

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,390
actually work together and make sure

00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:41,810
that you're still working and keeping

00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:43,610
pace the a big thing

00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:46,070
over and over again is keep your keep

00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:47,660
your code as usable for all users it's

00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:50,330
not enough just to have your code an

00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:53,390
open source code on github that is not

00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:55,400
an open community that is just a dump I

00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:57,140
mean it's just like I can go and pop me

00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,740
buddy's refrigerator at dump where I can

00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:04,100
buy a refrigerator at sears and roebuck

00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:09,710
ok Sears and up that old it was Sears

00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:11,810
when I was born I swear but it does

00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:13,670
matter where you come together and put

00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:15,500
pieces together having a community and

00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:17,920
making it so more people going to open

00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,850
that community and that means not only

00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,920
putting your code and putting your

00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:23,390
commits and your JIRA like tickets also

00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,370
inviting people and showing them how to

00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:28,460
fix it and saying thank you for solving

00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:31,280
this issue or or being a good player and

00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:32,810
a mentor and this and finally it's a

00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,110
it's kind of the dead horse I beat this

00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:38,140
interoperability is really

00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:39,580
I think that as we go forward any system

00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,560
that doesn't keep up with

00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:44,020
interoperability is just limiting the

00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,550
number of users it can come it can you

00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,620
can interact with

00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:49,780
I think the looking at how spark has

00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:51,370
evolved where there's a very Scala Java

00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:53,080
based thing and then it comes to Python

00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:55,840
and then R then sequel you can see that

00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,310
evolution of like the uptick and how it

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,640
evolved and I think that's a very

00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:02,380
important lesson for everyone to learn

00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,970
so with three minutes to spare I will

00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:07,450
say thank you very much and take any

00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:09,100
questions there if you want to contact

00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:11,590
me Twitter is the best way I do get

00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:15,150
emails but I also get a lot of emails so

00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:15,150
