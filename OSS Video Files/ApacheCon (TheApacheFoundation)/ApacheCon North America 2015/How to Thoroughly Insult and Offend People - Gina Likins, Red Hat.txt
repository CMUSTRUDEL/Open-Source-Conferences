I'm Jenna likens I do university

00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,480
outreach for red hat so what that means

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,690
is I work with universities to help them

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,940
do more open source which is fantastic

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,410
because we need more students doing open

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:19,980
source before joining red hat I worked

00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:22,560
in web stuff doing web strategy for 18

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,080
years mostly with telecommunications and

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,689
women's reproductive rights

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,820
organizations so I thought that I had

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:35,070
figured out all the ways that one could

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:38,250
really be awful online and then I joined

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,920
the open source world I've added some

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,690
new tricks to Maya repertoire that I'd

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,219
like to share with you today and you

00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:50,070
guys are all here because you want to

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:55,559
know how you can really torque people

00:00:50,070 --> 00:01:01,289
off online right right angry people rule

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:05,489
right right good that's what we're here

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:07,530
for so I've created disk on which is the

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,960
DEF CON in skull insult scale for

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,540
conversations it works just like the

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,740
DEFCON scale and it tells you for a

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:20,220
given conversation sort of what level of

00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:22,890
is involved and how you can escalate

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,299
from one level to the next so what I'd

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,030
like to do is go through each of these

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,090
levels and look at what the signifiers

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:34,650
are and how you can take it up from one

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:38,060
level to the next so first off disc on

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:41,729
level one green everything is peachy

00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:43,229
blue skies rainbows if I were better at

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:47,520
 I would have put a little unicorn

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:51,350
horn on the horse I failed at that no

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,119
one is unhappy this we need to change

00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:58,860
for each of these levels I'm going to go

00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:00,990
through a example email and what a

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,570
response might be so you can see how

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,310
these will change so here we've got one

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,759
where a potential new contributor has

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,890
said on awesomo OS version 11 there's a

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,319
missing dependency on lib plastic car

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:17,390
the plastic cart devel and they've sent

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:19,770
patched Louisville and green response

00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:23,700
thanks and I've even told them when

00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:26,400
Atlantean version 2 3 no one's angry

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:30,170
everyone's pleased this has got to

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:36,660
change so I'm going to take it up to

00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:39,420
level 2 blue level 2 blue is going to

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:42,780
make people uncomfortable maybe not

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:45,150
really hurt so some examples and this is

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,630
where you're going to insult things but

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:53,250
not people some good examples of level 2

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:57,690
blue are those really ugly pants or this

00:02:53,250 --> 00:03:00,870
is a terrible conference the commonality

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:04,170
here is that these statements are

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:07,260
unlikely to really upset people because

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:10,410
they're not really personal so again

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:13,110
let's look at the same email and look at

00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:15,570
a level two blue response we don't

00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:21,209
support awesome OS and we don't intend

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:23,579
to mediocre OS is fine and isn't hideous

00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:25,260
like that ill-conceived disaster the

00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:28,260
plastic cart so I haven't made it

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:32,489
personal this person is not personally

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:34,500
insulted so that's nice but I'd still

00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:39,720
like to take it up a level how do I do

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:43,410
that level 3 yellow easy add some curse

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:46,380
words your selection of curse words is

00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,840
up to you different ones fly better in

00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,130
different cultures if I had more time

00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,079
and tell you a funny story about my

00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:56,790
grandmother but we're short so I won't

00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:58,860
ask me later but this is crappy code or

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:05,250
those are some damn ugly pants might

00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:07,650
work here's an example substitute your

00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,390
own favorite curse words in here but

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:13,430
basically I've just Unleashed some

00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:17,039
invective on my poor patch submitter

00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:19,830
level 4 orange is where things start

00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:21,620
getting fun it's where instead of

00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:24,930
insulting

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,450
things or even cursing Lee insulting

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:32,460
things you actually start insulting

00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:35,460
people and some examples of that might

00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,610
be this conference instead of saying

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:41,040
this conference is terrible i might say

00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:48,600
anyone who attends this conference is an

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:51,600
idiot or whoever wrote that code has the

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,970
brains of a slug or that anyone who

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,250
would wear those pants is stupid in

00:04:53,970 --> 00:05:00,750
general even if people can brush it off

00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:02,490
if you say that a program is bad it's a

00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:05,100
lot harder to brush it off if you say

00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:12,270
whoever wrote that program is bad or

00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:14,910
stupid so here's the same email but this

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:19,050
time you'll notice that I pointed out

00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:24,300
that only a fool would update past up

00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:26,610
north 10 and version 10 is the only one

00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:30,120
that anyone runs real systems on so if

00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:32,820
you're running 11 you know you're stupid

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:37,560
and you don't run real systems so some

00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:39,510
nice embedded insults in that one that's

00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:47,840
still not good enough though we want to

00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:47,840
take it one more right yeah bring it so

00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:56,360
disc on level read this is your top

00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:59,760
level how do you get there threats add

00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:02,780
in some threats this is the quickest way

00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:07,400
to make any community feel hostile

00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:10,140
unfriendly and honestly frightening so

00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,760
some examples of that you do not just

00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,150
cursing you're not just insulting people

00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:20,270
you're wishing people harm or you're

00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:22,770
wishing harm befall them so for example

00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:26,700
anyone who would write code like that

00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:28,530
should crawl under a rock and die people

00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,450
who have that little fashion sense would

00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:32,560
be better off if they were just hit by

00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:36,230
trucks

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,980
and here's my final assault on my poor

00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,980
patch submitter

00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:54,509
so this person is probably never going

00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:58,550
to come back and here's a little summary

00:06:54,509 --> 00:07:04,860
of what these different levels are and

00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:06,930
what they correspond with we interrupt

00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,379
this program to point out that I clearly

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:14,729
don't believe any of this is a good idea

00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:16,229
it's a terrible idea and the good news

00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:21,810
is that there's a body of research to

00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:25,800
back me up on this research yeah

00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:27,900
research there is a field called

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,349
organizational behavior that was started

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:34,650
in roughly 1999-2000 that looks at the

00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:38,250
effect of environment on how productive

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:39,690
people are there's also a good body of

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:45,210
work that supports the idea that

00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:48,180
incivility and aggression are associated

00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:50,990
with occupational stress decrease

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,520
productivity and reduce job satisfaction

00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:57,479
now want to be crystal clear about

00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:01,529
something I am NOT saying that conflict

00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:03,810
is bad or criticism in that is bad in

00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:06,990
fact studies show that conflict and

00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:09,000
criticism can be good that they lead to

00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:11,279
increased group performance on certain

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,199
kinds of tasks and they help groups

00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:19,590
avoid groupthink so conflict is not the

00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:21,919
same thing as incivility not the same

00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:29,819
thing you can have a disagreement

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:32,099
without it being awful so the term

00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:33,449
workplace in civility came into being in

00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,360
about nineteen ninety nine in this

00:08:33,449 --> 00:08:37,680
Anderson and Pearson article there are

00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,630
two things I want to point out about

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:45,300
this slide one is if you take the word

00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:47,640
workplace and replace it with online

00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,610
community this is exactly the kind of

00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,649
behavior we're talking about

00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,870
characteristically rude and discourteous

00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:55,140
displaying a lack of regard for others

00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,430
the

00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,450
other thing I think it's important to

00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:03,960
point out about this slide is this word

00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:06,810
ambiguous intent this is important

00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,670
because I think that a lot of what

00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:12,990
happens in our communities that ends up

00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:17,280
making them feel unfriendly is not

00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:19,860
intentional people don't mean to crush

00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,320
others it just kind of happens it comes

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:26,030
out of people's mouths so to speak

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:29,370
before it's been well thought out and

00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:32,070
that's important because if we recognize

00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:35,070
that it's not all intentional then we

00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:39,470
can be more forgiving and more helpful

00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:39,470
as people try to correct their behaviors

00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:46,770
so what's this research that I'm talking

00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:49,440
about first of all there's a

00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:52,470
decent-sized corpus of research that

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,170
shows that our communities do in fact

00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:59,210
exhibit the exact kind of behaviors that

00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:02,940
are considered in civil or aggressive

00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:04,850
interesting aside and when I started

00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:08,150
researching this I was blown away

00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:10,410
because we do everything in the open

00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:15,900
there are a lot of people who are using

00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:18,690
us for research data like lots of us and

00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:21,390
their sociologists and linguists and

00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:24,090
behavioral scientists and because Oliver

00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:26,340
t is out there they're using our data to

00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,350
do the research so there's all these

00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,930
studies about open source communities

00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:32,550
and behavior and I was absolutely

00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:36,150
flabbergasted to find them I have a

00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:38,460
stack four inches tall of research

00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:42,540
studies about how people behave in open

00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:44,340
source communities okay them there's

00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,860
some caveats attempters and of course

00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:49,560
and studies or studies but let me show

00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:53,880
you a couple that i found one study

00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:59,640
published this january found that on lk

00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:01,910
ml lenis on average gets in salty twice

00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,910
a week

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,850
another Cuddy another study that did it

00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:10,470
was actually a automatic sentiment

00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,120
analysis studies they rode piece of

00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,190
software to do sentiment analysis in

00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,279
order to validate that piece of software

00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:19,500
they did a human coded sentiment

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,560
analysis first and they looked at two

00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:29,430
mailing lists the apache tomcat and the

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:32,360
apache ant lists and they found they

00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:35,670
categorize the emails in a couple ways

00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,649
and negative emails made up about

00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:40,529
nineteen percent of the developer list

00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:43,110
and actively aggressive emails made up

00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:45,750
one point six percent of the developer

00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:47,720
emails and that doesn't sound like a lot

00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:50,339
you know one-point-six percent so what

00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:54,990
but if you think about how many emails

00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:58,410
come in in a day and think about how

00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:01,680
many conversations you have and that 1.6

00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:05,459
that's a lot and that nineteen percent

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:09,209
are negative then wound up one out of

00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:12,810
every five emails is negative on the

00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:16,410
developer lists that's not a happy place

00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:19,339
to be another study showed that we

00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:22,230
accept flaming as a way to build status

00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:24,149
we think that you know showing

00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,889
somebody's wrong in a really

00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:28,470
argumentative way that requires as

00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:35,339
bestest pants is a way to show how good

00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:37,730
you are so oh my god the what are you

00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,730
wearing

00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:47,699
that's awful didn't did no one tell you

00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:51,829
that you really can't wear those at all

00:12:47,699 --> 00:13:01,019
unless you're like in Hawaii that's

00:12:51,829 --> 00:13:04,679
totally out of style we think when we do

00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:08,540
this to people that it's just between us

00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:10,920
and them it's not it's between us them

00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:14,970
everyone else who saw the conversation

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:17,850
and everyone else who reads it a week

00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:20,309
later two weeks later two years later

00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:23,059
who's considering joining the community

00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:25,499
I've been calling that the lobby affect

00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:28,079
somebody's going to watch this video and

00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:29,610
think oh my god I'm a horrible human

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,449
being and i'm not actually thought that

00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:38,069
was a kind of a cute shirt but let's so

00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:39,720
remember that we live in the open it

00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:42,089
feels like we're having one-on-one

00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:50,220
conversations we're not we're having

00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:53,069
very public conversations so what else

00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:55,529
did I learn one study found that all

00:13:53,069 --> 00:13:57,089
almost everybody who came to an open

00:13:55,529 --> 00:14:00,089
source community and then did not come

00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:01,949
back did not come back because they

00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:05,399
either did not receive a response at all

00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:08,480
we flat-out ignored them or because they

00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:12,360
received the condescending response

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,220
that's awful I mean you know you you

00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,959
walk in and someone either just doesn't

00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:21,350
pay any attention to you at all or they

00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:21,350
do the rtfm

00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:34,780
so how can you we've talked a little bit

00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:37,000
about the discount scale for

00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:40,980
conversations and the research that

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:45,280
backs up that we actually do this and

00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:47,710
that it is as harmful as it seems like

00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,350
it is that's it let's go back to how we

00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:53,620
can make things worse so what are some

00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:58,870
things we can do that might make it

00:14:53,620 --> 00:15:03,160
worse easy ones really easy ones talk it

00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:08,560
out cuz shouting it's better than

00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:10,080
failing more punctuation because they're

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,000
not going to charge you extra for it and

00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:23,790
and the difference between what do you

00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:27,490
think and what do you think is huge if

00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:30,130
you exaggerate how much impact something

00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:35,710
is going to have that will help for sure

00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:40,630
I came up with this braised tender words

00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:43,150
to describe words that when you put it

00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:46,780
in an email kind of tip the balance from

00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:51,010
an email being even toned to kind of

00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:55,300
being jabbing and some of these are from

00:15:51,010 --> 00:16:02,110
my experience some of them are from

00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:03,610
others observations technically someone

00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:05,410
is using the word technically in an

00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:09,089
email you can probably just ignore it

00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:09,089
because they're going to poke poke poke

00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:42,300
just ended up here because it is one of

00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:44,699
my tender words I have discovered that

00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:47,309
when I'm writing emails if the word just

00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:49,259
slips in there and I'm not referring to

00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:51,749
something that just happened it's

00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:55,309
because I'm angry and I'm trying to be

00:16:51,749 --> 00:17:01,709
right rather than have a conversation if

00:16:55,309 --> 00:17:04,559
you'll just open the and I need to

00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:10,589
stop walk away from the keyboard let it

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:15,449
go for a minute and move on assumptions

00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:18,750
this is an easy way to ramp up the level

00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:23,429
of unhappy in your community assume

00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:25,169
everybody else is an idiot no one else

00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:27,539
knows as much as you even about their

00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:30,270
areas of expertise so if anybody posts

00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:31,890
anything make sure to go at them and say

00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:33,120
well what makes you take that Stoke I

00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:39,210
would like to see your facts and

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:42,899
justification assume everyone is just

00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:44,190
like you so you know comments about how

00:17:42,899 --> 00:17:45,450
the wives are going to get mad because

00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:49,049
everybody's staying late because

00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:54,929
everybody's got wise of course assume

00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:57,929
that everyone is doing is it the same

00:17:54,929 --> 00:18:02,159
life stage assume everybody is a white

00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:04,919
middle-aged guys while you're at it and

00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:11,610
that by the way is as close as I'm going

00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:13,830
to get to the women in tech talk and I

00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:17,490
don't do that talk because that talk

00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:21,120
deserves an entire talk unto itself and

00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:24,960
being rude as equal opportunity a lot of

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:27,299
these things make a lot of people some

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,320
of them are women uncomfortable and make

00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:34,020
them choose not to be in our communities

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:36,690
that one the assumptions is a big part

00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:40,260
of it and finally assume everybody else

00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:42,149
is out to get you so forget that you're

00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:45,179
all on the same project working towards

00:18:42,149 --> 00:18:48,480
the same end goals and instead assume

00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:51,890
that if someone asks you a question

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,890
it's because they want to destroy you

00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,289
whenever I get to this point and

00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:09,270
historically we talked about yeah these

00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:11,490
are the things that happen you start

00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:13,049
getting what looked to me like excuses

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:17,630
and I want to go through what these

00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:21,029
excuses are and rebut them a little bit

00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:22,740
it's not that bad it's not that bad

00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:27,000
Jenna I mean this stuff really doesn't

00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:31,370
happen all that often no it's worse and

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:36,350
the research shows that it's worse

00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:40,710
furthermore it's worse when you consider

00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:43,049
the public face of open source and what

00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:46,549
people see when they go and they try to

00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:46,549
find out information about open source

00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:59,820
isn't having rude people around part of

00:19:50,039 --> 00:20:01,860
diversity to know and when I was

00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,270
building this deck I was working with my

00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,070
husband who's been doing up in source

00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:09,960
development for 16 years and he made a

00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:13,230
great point he said when we are working

00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:16,559
with code we would never work with an

00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:20,640
API that was flaky or poorly documented

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:23,210
or cars problems with our code why do we

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:27,149
accept less with the people we work with

00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:29,850
so why do we accept rude people in our

00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:37,409
communities they are the flaky bad badly

00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:40,669
documented api's so I hate this one so

00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:42,510
open source is transparency and

00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:44,970
transparency of course means saying

00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:46,320
everything and if you say everything you

00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:49,470
might as well just say it however you

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,240
want and somehow that Nets out to open

00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:55,169
source means saying everything however

00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,429
you want to say it that's crazy I mean

00:20:55,169 --> 00:20:58,649
that just that just doesn't make any

00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:02,309
sense this sort of false logical

00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:08,090
progression and you can be transparent

00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:08,090
without being in civil or rude

00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:18,429
well you know the community leaders a

00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:21,700
jerk what can I do about it it is I

00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:25,950
admit heart if the person who is the

00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:30,070
community leader is being a poopy head

00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:32,110
they do set the tone however one of the

00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:33,820
things about open sources we believe in

00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:36,700
the power of the individual as well we

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:39,639
believe you can fork the code we believe

00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:44,590
that you can make a change you can make

00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:46,929
a difference and change never happens

00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:51,610
unless individuals commit to making

00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:56,789
change so one of the reasons I agreed to

00:21:51,610 --> 00:22:00,610
do this is because you collectively are

00:21:56,789 --> 00:22:03,210
the power of open source and if you

00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:08,139
collectively choose to be differently

00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:10,360
then this will change over time people

00:22:08,139 --> 00:22:16,450
don't live forever community leaders

00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:22,629
change we can behave differently I can't

00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:24,100
it's too hard I don't know how yeah I'm

00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:25,889
sorry if you can write a bash script you

00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:31,840
can follow the rules for being polite

00:22:25,889 --> 00:22:35,440
politeness is just syntax and idiom it

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:38,740
is no more than that and if you can

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:45,549
follow good code syntax an idiom you can

00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:47,200
follow the rules for being nice and if

00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:50,129
you don't know what those are people can

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,129
help explain them to you

00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:01,460
this doesn't make sense to me this this

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,820
implies that there's some sort of power

00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:07,520
in fire and the melding of Warren yay

00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:08,960
that's crazy I mean there's no research

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,330
to show that that is true and there's a

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,660
lot of research to show that it's not

00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:17,240
that in fact the burn a nation scores

00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:21,010
people and drives them away and we lose

00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:27,830
good people on account of it so that's

00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:30,169
nuts just grazing and then you can't

00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:32,990
control how people feel you know my job

00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:37,850
is to say the thing and you're it's it's

00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:39,290
up to you how you take it to some degree

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:43,250
we are of course in control of our own

00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:45,799
emotions but communication is a two-way

00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:48,650
street you wouldn't expect to write code

00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:51,169
any old way shape or form and hope that

00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:53,290
the program interprets it correctly you

00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:56,570
know their rules of the road and

00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:57,890
communication is the same way so follow

00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:01,429
the rules of the road for good

00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:05,320
communication and you will be better off

00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:05,320
your community we will be better off and

00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:14,299
then you get the big ol etiquette is

00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:16,340
stupid and I give you Highland etiquette

00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:22,610
isn't stupid etiquette is what keeps

00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:25,549
society moving and finally if it's

00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:27,260
important to you you'll find a way if

00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:33,230
it's not important to you you'll find an

00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:37,970
excuse so how do we help I'm going to go

00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:41,150
through these really quickly if we have

00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:44,450
a way to talk about bad behavior we have

00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:47,840
a way to discuss it which helps us fix

00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:50,690
it use my scale use something else just

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,390
talk about it if you see somebody doing

00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:59,390
something that puts you up at a level 3

00:24:53,390 --> 00:25:01,850
blue talk about it don't do any of that

00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:03,530
that's just a bad idea if you're writing

00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:06,530
an email and you've seen you don't stop

00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:08,679
walk away from the keyboard come back to

00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,679
it later

00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:15,630
no your own tender words discovering

00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:18,059
that just was one of mine which I will

00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:22,380
admit took me until I was 41 years old

00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:24,870
was a big kind of light bulb know what

00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:27,720
yours are know when when you see

00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:31,130
yourself type just that you need to stop

00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,130
step back walk away from the keyboard

00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,669
avoid making assumptions about others

00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,970
other than trying to remember that

00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:42,299
you're all on the same team you're all

00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:45,929
trying to get the same place and if you

00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:48,210
remember that and try to hear what

00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:51,750
they're saying through that lens I just

00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:57,000
totally mix that metaphor then you will

00:25:51,750 --> 00:26:00,840
be better off ask for stronger codes of

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:07,020
conduct spell out that insulting people

00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:10,080
is not okay and that level 5 red abusing

00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:13,820
people is never okay and you should be

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:16,440
expelled from a community if you do that

00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:19,440
remind people of the lobby effect that

00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:23,130
what we do is visible not only to the 15

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,409
or 20 or 50 of us in the room but to

00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:27,090
everybody who's doing research about our

00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:31,620
communities or who's considering joining

00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:35,100
this community in six months and that

00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:37,440
because of that it's it's not a private

00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:43,200
space it's a public space and we should

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:46,409
try to set good examples if someone is

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,720
crossing a line contact them and I

00:26:46,409 --> 00:26:51,360
recommend doing it either offline you

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,279
know by phone if you know them or by

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:57,720
email it's really attempting to do it on

00:26:53,279 --> 00:27:01,649
list because transparent and because you

00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:05,370
know you want to be right if you can go

00:27:01,649 --> 00:27:08,490
off list especially if it seems that

00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:11,820
they have done it and they don't realize

00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:16,260
it that gives them a chance to back out

00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:18,030
and remember what your endgame is your

00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:20,130
end game is to get everybody working

00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:23,370
together it's not to win an argument

00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:26,160
so contact him say you know when when I

00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:29,670
read this this is what I heard I'm not

00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:31,140
sure that's what you meant this is a

00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:37,200
blank slide because this is where I tell

00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:40,460
you a sad story I was lucky I was

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:44,640
incredibly lucky I came into open source

00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:49,170
sideways because of good friends people

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:51,750
like Tom Calloway and Ruth Seeley who I

00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:56,160
knew who were involved in open source I

00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:58,050
went to barcamp at RT you for four years

00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:04,110
before I ever started working for red

00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:07,440
hat therefore I knew the ideals of open

00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:11,640
source the transparency and community

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:15,150
and collaboration before I have a really

00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:17,040
saw a mailing list and that's a good

00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:19,260
thing because if I come in through the

00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,450
front door and it gone looking for

00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:24,060
mailing list and projects to contribute

00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:26,700
to I probably wouldn't be standing here

00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:30,150
today because I would have seen what

00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:32,460
happens especially if I had happened to

00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:35,370
stumble upon things that talk about

00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:37,710
women in open source and I would have

00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:39,570
said no don't need any of that I'm

00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:45,020
perfectly happy doing web stuff thank

00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:47,910
you very much and that's really sad so

00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:50,820
every week or two I go and I stand in

00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:55,440
front of rooms full of college students

00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:59,250
and I tell them how magic open source is

00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:02,190
and how powerful open sources and how

00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:04,260
open source is the only thing they don't

00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:08,160
need permission to go do that they can

00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:09,300
go join an open source project and start

00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,440
committing they don't need to take the

00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,620
class they don't need their parents

00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:17,370
permission they can just go and do it

00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:19,830
and the last week i was up at a a

00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:21,510
college doing this in Western North

00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:24,210
Carolina Center talking to his people

00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:26,780
with this giant pile of research in

00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:30,630
front of me showing how badly behaved

00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:32,070
many of our communities were and reading

00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:34,920
these quotes

00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:37,440
these things that people actually said

00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:41,340
to each other and looking at these kids

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:45,420
and going god can i really send them

00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:48,680
into this and and that that made me feel

00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:55,230
bad like Jenna can I send them into this

00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:56,940
and feel good about it so then I got

00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:58,620
depressed and was like oh my god I can't

00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,940
even do the rest of the deck and what am

00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,440
I going to do I can't tell these people

00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:05,030
anything this has all been said before

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:07,530
nothing's ever changing in you know

00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:14,520
pricing some conscience and life is

00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:17,550
terrible and then I realized change

00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:21,570
happens because people continue to tilt

00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:24,360
at windmills and that we have to keep

00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:28,140
talking about this the more we talk

00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:30,150
about it especially in places like this

00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:33,210
where you are the leaders in your

00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:39,380
community where you can make this change

00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:39,380
happen the more likely it is to happen

00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:46,560
so i finished my talk wrapped up my

00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:49,020
slides did the next talk at a college

00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:51,480
and told the kids how magic open source

00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:55,620
was and that they could do it in rah rah

00:30:51,480 --> 00:31:01,590
rah and I look at you and I'll give you

00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:06,420
one last permission let it go in the

00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:10,380
ELSA sense we've all made mistakes every

00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:12,330
last one of us has said something not

00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:16,830
maybe in the most polite way we possibly

00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:18,990
could have our behavior hasn't perhaps

00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:22,530
been the best reflection of who we want

00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:28,400
to be it's okay i give you permission to

00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:33,020
today start afresh to make it better

00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:37,680
starting today if everyone in this room

00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:40,260
said we can do better i know we can do

00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,490
better we can coach or younger people to

00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,820
do better we can coach our other

00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:46,830
community people to do better our

00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:52,550
communities would be better and that's

00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:52,550
