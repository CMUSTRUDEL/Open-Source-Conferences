	Pravega: Storage for data streams

There is no shortage of use cases with elements that continuously generate data: end users posting updates and shopping online; sensors that periodically emit samples; drones that continuously produce aerial video streams; connected cars that generate a combination of videos, images, and telemetry; and server fleets that generate an abundance of telemetry data. One common aspect shared by several of these cases is that the sources of data are machines, and at scale, machines can generate data at extremely high volumes. Machine-generated data creates an important challenge for analytics systems to ingest, store and process such high-volumes of machine-generated data in an efficient and effective manner. Pravega is a software system developed from the ground up to enable applications to ingest and store high-volumes of continuously generated data. Pravega exposes the stream as a core storage primitive, which enables applications continuously generating data to ingest and store such data permanently. Applications that consume stream data from Pravega are able to access the data through the same API, independent of whether it is tailing the stream, reprocessing the stream, or processing historical data. Pravega has some unique features such as the ability of storing an unbounded amount of data per stream, while appending transactionally and scaling according to workload variations. It uses an underlying segment abstraction not only to implement such features, but advanced ones to support stream applications such as state synchronization and key-value tables. In this presentation, we overview Pravega, including its main features and architecture. We show how to use Pravega when building streaming data pipelines along with stream processors such as Apache Flink. We have implemented Pravega connectors for Flink that enable end-to-end exactly-once semantics for data pipelines using Pravega checkpoints and transactions. Pravega is an open-source project, licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0, and hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/pravega/pravega).

Flavio Junqueira is a Senior Distinguished Engineer at Dell. He holds a PhD in computer science from the University of California, San Diego, and he is interested in various aspects of distributed systems, including distributed algorithms, concurrency, and scalability. His recent work at Dell focuses on stream analytics, and specifically, on the development of a novel storage system for streams called Pravega. Before Dell, Flavio held an engineering position with Confluent and research positions with Yahoo! Research and Microsoft Research. Flavio has co-authored a number of scientific publications (over 4,000 citations according to Google Scholar) and an Oâ€™Reilly ZooKeeper book on Apache ZooKeeper. Flavio is an Apache Member and has contributed to projects hosted by the ASF, including Apache ZooKeeper (as PMC and committer), Apache BookKeeper (as PMC and committer), and Apache Kafka.
