Apache Beam provides a unified programming model to execute batch and streaming pipelines on all the popular big data engines. The translation layer from Beam to the chosen big data engine is called a runner. A little more than one year ago, a new Spark runner based on Spark Structured Streaming framework was started and it has been merged to Beam master since. This talk will give updates about this new runner showing some added features, some performance improvements and also things that are yet to come.

Etienne has been working in software engineering and architecture for more than 16 years. He is focused on Big Data subjects. He is an Open Source fan and contributes to Apache projects such as Apache Beam, Apache Flink or Apache Spark. He is a Beam committer and PMC member.
