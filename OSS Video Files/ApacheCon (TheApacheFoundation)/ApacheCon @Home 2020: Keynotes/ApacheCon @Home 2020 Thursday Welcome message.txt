without our sponsors

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,680

we have several teams i'm actually going

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,560
to try to

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,680
to go to the live dashboard instead of a

00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,120
screenshot

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,760
these are our teams that have been

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,040
working on this throughout the week

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,640
and uh

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,800

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,879
just see this screenshot that's fine

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:18,640
if you go to bugbash.muse.dev

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:21,360
you will see the uh

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,239
the dashboard and uh we have a number of

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,920
teams running

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:29,120
and uh it looks like team thread

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:32,159

event is running there are a number of

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,240
ways that you can communicate with

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:54,160
people on the platform and uh the

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,400
event team we uh we are monitoring all

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,919
of the various chats on the hoppin

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,320
platform uh please do ask any questions

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,240
there

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,240
and i will try to respond as quickly as

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,520
i can as well as other other people on

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,639
my team

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,400
we also have a slack instance and

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,560
somewhere around a thousand of you have

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,280
joined that slack instance uh it's still

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,199
available

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,880
and it will be available after the event

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,840
if you want to continue to discuss the

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,280
event once it's over

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,360
there is a hallway track that is listed

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,960
under the sessions tab at the left-hand

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,560
side of your screen

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,479
um we're seeing a lot more activity on

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,160
that as people start joining there and

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,120
chatting i'll be in and out of that all

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,039
day and there's

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,320
several other of our community members

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,639
who have uh

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,039
kind of volunteered to staff that to be

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,199
welcoming

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,280
and finally we do have the polls i had

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,680
intended to run more polls this week but

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,080
uh

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,360
time kind of got away from me but there

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,600
are some polls in there

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,199
about who you are and why you're here

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,080
now one of the most exciting things

00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,560
about these polls to me is that 85

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,919
of you are here for your very first

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,600
apache con and that's

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,240
that's particularly exciting to me

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
because building the community is what

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,720
this is about

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,639
so thank you for coming and please stick

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,319
around after the conference

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,360
there's a number of ways that you can do

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:20,560
that stick around i mean

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,120
um you can follow us on twitter

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,400
now most apache projects not all of them

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,319
but most of them

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,000
have social media accounts where you can

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,960
connect with the community

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,720
the three that i have listed here are

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,759
the ones that uh

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,600
that are kind of top level at the apache

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,520
software foundation we have the apache

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,319
con one which is primarily about this

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,160
event

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,919
so it tends to go a little bit quiet

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,759
between events

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,160
the asf is our primary twitter account

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,440
and

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:55,039
the apache community twitter account

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:58,800
follows our individual uh project

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,800
communities and what they're doing

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,520
we have a youtube channel this is

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,520
probably the question that people have

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,599
asked me most this week is

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,880
where can i watch the sessions that i

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,039
missed

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,199
they will be on our youtube channel not

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,000
today not tomorrow but over the coming

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,400
weeks

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,039
as we download and process all the

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,880
videos

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,479
that the conference platform has

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,919
collected for us

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:27,120
uh they will start appearing there

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:30,120
we will also be writing a

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,160
wrap-up about this event on blogs

00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,440
blogs.apache.org which is also a great

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,919
place to find out

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,599
about things from all over the apache

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,560
community

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:43,199
and we hope that many of you will get

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,800
involved in our projects

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,800
projects that you've learned about maybe

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,400
you participated in the bug bash or you

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,639
learned something and you want to learn

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,639
more

00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,960
lists.apache.org is the lifeblood of the

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,879
apache software foundation

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,319
this is where all of the discussion

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,840
happens uh

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:05,199
we we have millions of email

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,039
messages here and we have archives going

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,400
back in the past if you want to do some

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:13,840
some history research so please join us

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,840
