in china before all of

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,040
that i want to do a short introduction

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,920

my pleasure and my honor also i'm the vp

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,840
and pmc member of apache skywalking

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,680
and i also work with the community

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,719
including the

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,399
apache api 6 apache incubators

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,560
shutting scale each hr stop and

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,280
scheduler

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,840
so also in the open source i work with

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,160
the cncf

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,160
and to do a part of the kubecon program

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,360
committee in last two years

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,160
so basically my work is quite related to

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,160
the open source

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,640
so in the last year's financial

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,879
year report of the apache foundation

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,400
china has already

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,040
been the largest user base of the apache

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,120
project

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:38,480
and you can see from the map and

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,519
the chinese users downloads

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:45,200
much much more apache

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,680
software than any other places

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,519
so this is the base this is the base of

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,560
the whole community scenes we have the

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,120
user

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,400
we have all the people get interested in

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,440
apache software

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,120
we have people recognized and look

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,319
forward apache culture

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,000
so that's how things begins

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,000
user begins to join the apache

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,680
foundation with as a user

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,120
and then one day they may become a

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,680
contributor

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,319
and they may invite new people to join

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,080
us

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,879
so it's it's great it's great to have

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,760
all of the people

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,959
also like uh all of the foundation of

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,640
the open source we

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:27,040
thanks our spend sponsors uh in

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,440
the apache foundation we have several

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,560
important sponsors from china

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,599
huawei tencent cloud by alibaba

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,000
inspire so all of that they just not

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,319
just

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,440
give some money to the foundation to

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,680
keep up

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,440
keep us moving also at the same time

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,840
they support their employees they

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,840
support

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,879
the people around this ecosystem to take

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,400
part in the open source

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,640
so with that we have a larger developer

00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,640
team

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,959
also in the last year september i think

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,000
that's the

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,920
that's the last apache come before all

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,640
of the corp19 scenes

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,840
so that is about to come north america

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,239
september

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,880
2019 so we have the largest attendee

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,680
and we have the largest speaker team uh

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,400
flies from

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,000
china to go still there to mute to meet

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,440
a lot of friends

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,520
from the apache foundation and

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,360
we can know each other and we have

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,000
direct talk finally

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,280
some of them we have talked a lot at the

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,520
mail list

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,840
several years but this time we have

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,199
finally have the time to

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:46,240
meet each other also

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,800
the other thing is since now

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,360
i think because we have a new top-level

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,440
project

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:58,240
just several days ago the iot tv

00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:00,960
so basically we have 12

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,759
top level projects initialized in china

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,080
of course it's

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,120
only initialized because all of the

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,520
communities

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,360
they have uh diversity they have

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,400
developers they have users all around

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,320
the world

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:17,280
but this for me this is a very big step

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,840
because as far as i know uh there is a

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,800
apache com china roadshow back to 10

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,400
years ago

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,600
but at that moment that support by

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,199
people from ibm people from microsoft

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,240
but there is no single one project

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,560
contributed and donated from china the

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,440
open source is very lagged back in 10

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,639
years ago

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,840
but here we are today we have 12

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:48,560
already graduated as a top level project

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:51,840
that covers big data of durability

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,960
distributed system or iot fields a lot

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,960
of them

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,520
uh we are looking forward to have more

00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,639
projects originally from china

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,800
or chinese people and we are looking

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,360
forward more people to join

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,000
all of the apache projects to contribute

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,199
all of them

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,440
about projects

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,360
also at the same time there are still

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,479
eight china initial projects

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,120
incubating some incubated for a long

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,360
time

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,800
like four years and some are very young

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,639
just joined

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,680
incubator several months ago so

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,440
this is they're still protein but

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,800
we are looking forward they are growing

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,560
up they could

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,840
adopt the patchy way they can adopt

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:41,120
the apache culture then

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,840
we can have more contributor we can have

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,319
more people

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,319
known about apache software foundation

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,160
uh i take some example from the china

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,160
initial top-level project there is

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,960
double killing skywalking

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,240
and all of them have already have a very

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,039
huge developer

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,479
team this screenshot just to take from

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,080
their mail repo

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,479
and from github so some of them even

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,520
have

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:15,360
over 300 sometimes have 200

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,479
contributors they attract

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,680
a lot of people this project originally

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,479
from china

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,280
and their job that that way how to

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,400
capital

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,280
uh community how to attract a new

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,599
developer

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,919
how to guide people in to learn the

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,039
apache to learn the project to learn the

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,479
open source

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,880
so that is pretty cool that is not

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,840
a small number that's it's already huge

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,039
no matter

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,680
uh the number of contributes you put in

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,960
any place

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,960
is already a big numbers

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:54,479
also at the same time we have

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,199
thousands of people apache members from

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,720
china some lives in still lives in china

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,560
some already moved to other

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:06,000
places of the world and already

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:10,400
today in the 2020s

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,680
board meeting we have 11 new

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,720
members selected including myself

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,400
so uh that is good way because i still

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,599
remember back to

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,639
four years ago when

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,599
i created the sky walking there and i'm

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,199
trying to find i was trying to find a

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,880
way to bring the project

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:35,279
to the apache incubator and it's

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,159
really really very hard to find a

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,080
memento

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:43,440
finder people get familiar with

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,760
how the foundation works how to get step

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,760
one

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,680
today we can see in china there are

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,440
projects have

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,920
much much more options and

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,800
i'm really looking forward more more

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,440
people could join

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,560
and for the local community there is a

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,760
big step and

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:09,360
there is a very exciting things about

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:12,320
the hatch foundation or

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,839
approve we can set up the apache local

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,120
community officially

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:20,000
so some people some of us build the

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,519
apache local community beijing chapter

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,360
beijing local community

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:28,399
so with that because we have the most

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,680
uh members uh from china

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:36,000
they lived in beijing so we are hoping

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:40,399
that local community not just started

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,560
uh just uh in beijing we are trying to

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,240
make this local community become the

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,880
china local community

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,880
we are trying to broadcast the apache

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,839
culture we are trying to broadcast

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,839
the arbitrate

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,560
uh at the beginning at 2090

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,279
uh just before the court of night being

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,720
breakout

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,120
we have a real face-to-face apache event

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,279
at

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,480
hai university beijing so there are

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,640
several uh

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,880
boarding and top layer projects could

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,880
join there to talk with the students

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,160
to guide them what is the open source

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,519
what is your patchway that's is pretty

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,519
cool

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,680
and then you know that's the beginning

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,000
of the 2020

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,360
uh called native breaks and the whole

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,399
country knocked down

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,480
sadly that we didn't stop we are trying

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,560
to make that another opportunity

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,959
to broadcast to apache culture

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,839
so at the chinese new year we are

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,040
setting

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,760
a brand a new podcast

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,360
in chinese for local people to talk

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,920
about

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,480
the characters of open source developer

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,839
uh

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,519
the business value and the apache way

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:02,560
and the company behind the open source

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,760
the company's benefits from the open

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,120
source project

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:10,240
and so on and including some people

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,680
like me how to live uh with some open

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,480
source community

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,320
you can do a job that's pretty new in

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,320
china most of people think

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:25,200
uh ford open source is still a

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:27,920
a very uh you you must do that in free

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,320
you must don't donate all your personal

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,120
time

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,200
to help others so there is some business

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,480
mode of the open source we are trying to

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,570
make that

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,839
uh accepted by people and

00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,320
[Music]

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,880
you can do open source you can do the

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,480
public good like the apache foundation

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:50,480
wants and you also can earn the money

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,959
actually you must have some payments to

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,399
leave

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:58,079
right also in today in this

00:11:54,399 --> 00:12:01,360
summer and we are working with

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,240
some institute of the software chinese

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,200
economy of the

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,320
science uh some of the china initial

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,450
apache project

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,760
joined these promotion plans dislike

00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:15,760
[Music]

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:21,760
google summer codes but here so

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,760
we can have mentors to guide students

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,680
to join the community to make their

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,240
first move

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,880
to contribute their first line to the

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,959
codes

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,320
to the documents to the blogs to the

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:37,279
website

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:41,120
so once they have their first step

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:43,760
some of them may decided to move on

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,800
because as far as i know there is

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,240
several

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,360
people several students from this

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,560
project

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,880
has already be nominated

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,000
and selected as a budget commissioner

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,040
already

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,519
at least in skywalking and uh

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:07,440
api six several of them that will be a

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:10,480
great success for me to this kind of

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,519
plants and

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,160
for the last year uh the magic

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,120
foundation

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,519
built the film of australian student

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,040
service of the apache

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:25,519
foundation and the local community

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,200
we are building the subtitle the chinese

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:31,200
subtitle

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:35,360
for the film and forward all of these

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:39,760
in the china local uh broadcast plan for

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:42,880
the billy biddy so we right here they

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:46,079
have troubles to go to the youtube

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:49,360
and so we gave them an

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:51,680
alternative way

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,480
also we know the chinese people like

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,279
wechat

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,839
so we built up a wechat public account

00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:01,360
that account covers a lot of things

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:04,720
including translating the apache blocks

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,440
into the chinese and ascend

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,440
the technical articles from different

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,720
projects

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:16,560
first introduction about people who

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:20,639
involved in the open source like

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:23,279
budget members like pmc members

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,959
new contributors new commissioners or

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,040
the local events

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,560
we are trying to broadcast them trying

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,160
to make people

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:35,279
get touched with all of the projects

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:40,000
all of the open source project here

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:43,279
so they can find a way that

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,079
they are very close to all of those

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:49,120
people they can get to talk with them

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:51,440
they can have uh

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,839
directly message they have their wechat

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:57,120
account so people can talk to each other

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,320
because in china and in the chinese

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,480
culture today

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,680
people like the direct direct talk

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,800
always

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,920
that's why the wechat still we all know

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,279
there is a challenge

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:12,639
still happening about the mail list uh

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,680
vs the direct message and this challenge

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,800
happens

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,880
everywhere in the world and out in the

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,440
western world there were slack

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,560
in our site there is a wechat and there

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,240
is a google

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:29,040
cucu so basically that same

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,600
people prefer the direct message but

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,639
still we know the values of the

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,959
uh i think communication

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,759
uh we know the value of the mail list

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,920
and we

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,199
made the value of talk and token

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,399
theoretically

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:46,720
and github issues so that's

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,560
that's why that's why we built so many

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,160
articles to guide people

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,160
to talk to them the value

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,000
and also the broadcaster things

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,279
continues

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,920
uh because we built up the

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,199
chinese new year podcast series back

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,600
then there was no

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,680
bachelor local community because at that

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,720
moment it's not

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,120
they were not approved but after that we

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,560
have the new series of the podcast

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,040
powered by the

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,959
about no community beijing we have

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:24,079
several members

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:26,639
several pmc and project origin operator

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,199
commissioners they have different very

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,639
different

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:33,839
open source journey so

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:37,279
we set up series to interview them to

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,000
share for shell their acknowledge this

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,199
year

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,800
how they got touched with

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,800
the apache project at

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,000
first place so people can learn from

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,279
them

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,120
people can find their way

00:16:53,279 --> 00:17:00,320
to find the angle and the entrance

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,600
to join the community i think that is

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:06,240
hard for many many people

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,280
and for me it's exciting about this is

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,160
the first

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,039
i think this is first uh i have to come

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,600
at home

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,880
so this is also the first time we have

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,520
the mandarian track

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,319
this time this is just a part of the

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,839
track

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:24,559
but still it's very great to see

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,120
we have different language scenes

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,600
because

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,679
we still don't have the real apache calm

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,559
at china we have no show

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,280
and i'm looking forward when do we have

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,679
a

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,799
very bigger magic cam after all this

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,799
club night in chaos

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,160
so look forward all of these

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:52,400
and also as current status

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:55,280
is very good uh optical of 19. so

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,640
data to come low show china 2020 this

00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,559
will be happens

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:04,240
uh both online and offline

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:07,760
so we will call host events with

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,240
uh course control 22 because

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,440
many apache members already have the

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,559
chance to

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:19,280
join every year's core

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:21,840
costs come for all of the open source

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,280
sometimes the colleague provides venues

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,960
but this time because of

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:30,559
called dieting we are providing

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,679
four places for the speakers

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:37,200
so they can meet each other face to face

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,200
and they also could do

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:44,240
broadcast online at the same time

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:48,400
this is our idea to balance

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:52,240
the same and people want to get

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,799
in touch face to face so

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,280
this is the i think this is the last big

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,480
news

00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:02,400
in the 2020 we are trying to do in

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,720
local communities also

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,559
we have a big progress in all of the

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,600
open source scenes

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:12,880
in china with all of the apache scenes

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:16,000
in china we are making great progress

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,880
but also at the same time

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,400
there are some challenges and open

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,600
source culture like i said obvious

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,000
culture is

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:28,960
still like you are

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,559
you are making public good only and

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,400
people are refusing

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:36,960
uh to accept that some of them are

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,480
for commercial some of them for their

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,600
personal life

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,440
uh some of just taking it as a job

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:48,000
so because of a lack of the diversity

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,840
uh people think they are not qualified

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,679
enough to join the open source

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:56,640
including the apache software

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,000
so we are trying to change that there's

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,120
a lot of work to do

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,240
and as many people expected english is

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,760
still blocked

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:09,280
that since we are also working hard

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:12,159
trying to remove that blocks and

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,280
in this year in the mandarin track we

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,919
are

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,640
there there is a presentation about a

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,960
translation

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:24,799
robots and to link to wechat

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:27,919
uh mail list and even github issue

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,200
they're just beginning and i hope some

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,200
blocks will be there

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,720
for many more people for many people

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,799
already involved in the open source

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,840
english just a skill a tour

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:39,840
to share ideas to talk with each other

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,280
to talk friends globally

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,679
but for some people they lack of the

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,840
personal connection globally and

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,039
mederian is still the only language

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:53,360
they're using

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,320
and reading english documents already a

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,360
challenge for

00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:00,400
many of them and saying and

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:04,320
typing or speaking that is

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,520
a huge step also and the building

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,400
community about

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,320
someone is still controlling their open

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,880
source project they're on to controlling

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,159
all of them

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,799
that's your culture but but

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,600
we want to highlight that the most the

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:21,520
last thing

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:24,880
and still from my personal perspective

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:28,720
there is much much

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:31,840
more important is enough time

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:35,520
people china they are work like

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:38,720
10 hours per day and six

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,440
even seven days per week you can see

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,000
that there's

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,440
nearly all of your time your even lack

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,360
of time to

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,880
stay with your family stay with your

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,720
kids your parents

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,919
so in that case

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,000
it's really impossible

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,000
no matter what this culture is no matter

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,120
what's the tool master language

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
it's impossible to ask them to take part

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,320
in open source

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,360
even many of them attracted them

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,600
personally

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,640
they are very interested in the open

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,000
source community

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,720
they want to contribute even at

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,360
least one night of a code they will feel

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:21,360
very satisfied the real

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:26,400
they encourage it encourage them a lot

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:28,960
so i hope there is a more

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,159
open source based company there is more

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,080
open source project

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:37,039
donated from chinese company

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,440
people will have their time scheduled

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,960
and

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:44,720
to work on the open source at any

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,600
time they want they could have their own

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,520
time they have

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:52,320
all interest and all of that i think

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,360
not just the people from the apache

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,200
local community

00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:00,159
is from all of the chinese companies

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,200
we are trying we are trying hard to

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:06,240
remove all of these blocks

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,280
personally i'm very optimists because i

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,760
have seen a lot of improvements in the

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,760
last

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,960
four years and a lot of people joined

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:19,600
open source

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:24,320
a lot of people say that it's already

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:26,480
a support for their career so

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,679
let's see let's see how these things

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,440
works i think

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:34,640
maybe two or three or five years later

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,559
and i came back to this stage i got back

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,200
to maybe 2025's

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,799
apache com and give a similar

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,760
presentation

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,919
to compare to this one to show people

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,120
how things approve

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:52,240
