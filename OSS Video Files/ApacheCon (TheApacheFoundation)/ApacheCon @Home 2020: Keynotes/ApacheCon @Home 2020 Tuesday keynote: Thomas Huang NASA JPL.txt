00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,039
and uh welcome back to everybody

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,279
we're going to move right along to our

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,840
next keynote presentation now

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,719
and i'm super excited to introduce

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,640
thomas wang

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,840
who is with the jet propulsion

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,760
laboratories

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,920
he's going to be talking about the

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,800
importance of building a community

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,960
rather than a castle so without taking

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,320
up any more of his time thank you thomas

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,239
so much for joining us

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:55,680
and i will step off stage now all right

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:59,359
thank you rich let me get my screen

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,480
going here all right

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:06,080
so um thank you so much for inviting me

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,560
uh to uh this uh conference

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,240
uh i've been looking forward to actually

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,439
i've been looking forward to come to uh

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,799
new orleans

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,040
for a while but then again 2020 is a

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,320
very unique year for all of us

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,640
uh but uh think uh thanks to technology

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,520
we still managed to get the community

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,040
going and

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,960
still communicate and being stay

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,520
productive so as

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,000
rich mentioned i work at the jpl i've

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,040
been

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,240
here for more than two decades

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,960
uh been some of the things that we've

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,720
been doing

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,000
uh as you know many of you probably

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,280
heard jpl

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,280
is very famous for the mars rover

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,560
uh obviously we're doing more than the

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,920
mars rover uh

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,880
we have been working on variety of uh

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,320
missions um and this is actually i

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,040
managed

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,320
a pretty large team at the jpl mainly

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,719
doing development

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,719
uh for to supporting all these uh

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,840
planetary and also earth science

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,200
missions

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,959
um so just give you a little bit of

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,039
background on the some of the challenges

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,000
we've been dealing with the jpl then

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,440
actually

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,720
it's not just jpl but in general uh for

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,080
um our space missions um

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,599
we noticed that um you know as the

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,480
instruments are getting more advanced uh

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,280
we actually

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,200
collecting much more data a lot more

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,840
data than before and you can look at

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,560
this

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,000
uh picture here on the upper right you

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,599
know the currently regen

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,959
one of the missions is to be generating

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,599
about 48 uh 485 gigabytes of data per

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,120
day

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,599
uh the ones that we will be launching

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,599
next year is going to be 17 terabyte

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,080
and the following year is going to be 86

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,120
terabytes this is per day

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,360
now this is just one mission

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,319
okay and we are looking at uh in the

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,400
next year

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,480
and beyond we are looking at petabyte

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,400
scale missions

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,959
and as we start moving to the new era

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,640
we are looking at uh doing smarter uh we

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,440
rather than just collecting lots of data

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,040
what can we

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,840
um um creating a solution where we can

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,680
doing

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,159
um basically is a whole life cycle of

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,000
data

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,920
right can we do some smarts on board uh

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,519
do something analysis some of the

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,519
if you you know let's say you launch

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,760
something to the mars uh

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,760
well data takes at least 15 minutes to

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,879
get back to earth right so

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,200
what happened you missed something

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,959
important right so you want to be able

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,959
to do some really smart uh onboard

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,000
analysis and be able to capture the

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,280
information

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,080
um well and and not just waiting for the

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,959
data to download looking at

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,000
how to be smarter in terms of managing

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,200
our ground stations

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,840
where we can actually uh prioritize uh

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,319
data collections and more importantly we

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,040
have massive data archives so

00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,680
and the basically is this is where you

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,879
know

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,840
the science actually happens so

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,959
um this is a chart that i got from our

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,599
nasa

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,000
sponsored uh and for those who do not

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,480
know

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,480
a lot about nasa we don't just have one

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,560
big archives uh

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,919
we actually have a just for the earth

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,680
science side of things we actually have

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,560
distributed archives across the

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,240
the nation um and this is under the

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,520
picture on the right is really the

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,639
the all the data centers

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,320
um and the ones on the left is where

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,919
we've seen the challenge here right this

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,520
is uh we're in 2020

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:40,160
right now we are somewhere uh you know

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,479
collectively we have um you know almost

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,280
around 50 petabyte data

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,040
but we're looking at getting to hundreds

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,840
of petabyte data within the next few

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,960
years

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,120
right this is just for nasa itself

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,960
and um and come back to here these

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,440
archive are distributed across so they

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,520
don't have

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,280
we don't have a centralized uh uh

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,520
location for this

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,800
and you finally look at this chart again

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,360
is that um

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,800
you have uh these on the left side just

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,759
all the earth science missions that

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,720
currently where uh

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,520
and in the near future we'll be flying

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,560
um

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,960
in nasa alone and if you look at this

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,560
if you take any kind of a climate

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,280
science class or just general earth

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,520
science class

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,520
they will tell you that when you look at

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,080
climate research we can just look at one

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,600
parameter

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,360
let's say you know the the the level of

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,000
the ocean right well great if it's

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,759
rising

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,759
what is affecting to that what's the

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,759
tribute to that what are the factors

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,440
uh if there's a hurricane happening well

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,720
what a different variable that's playing

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,479
along these are different physical

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,000
variables so it's not just a one

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,800
measurement and you will get all the

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,520
answers

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,000
uh it's a really integrated science uh

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,440
and

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,280
just to so that you can get the whole

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,360
picture um

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,639
and it's also combining data from

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,720
different kind of measurements and

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,880
different kinds of spatial and temporal

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,000
resolutions this is just earth science

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,039
alone within

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,479
nasa but think about globally right we

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,120
have a global community the

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,720
other nations other agencies also flying

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,479
their own cell like collecting their own

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,240
measurement which our science

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,240
uh community also would like to have

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,759
access to

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,280
so this is going to give you a little

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,360
perspective here this is just

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,440
one parameter that we've been uh

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,560
collecting uh this is measuring the uh

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,600
the sea level

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,199
uh over about over two decades and this

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,479
animation is actually

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:31,360
um is collecting um uh base

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,080
um you know see how things are evolving

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,080
over

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,199
time if you look at the chart on your

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,400
lower right

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,360
you see the the sea level is rising uh

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,440
this is not

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,520
fabricated data this is just data that

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,560
we collected and we just plot the

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,840
information

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,880
um so actually if you take a closer look

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,240
at this picture i can

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,680
you know hear the picture you know hear

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,880
the music the inception playing the

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,520
background

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,319
so but again this is just a one

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,880
parameter

00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,440
all right um but if you take it take a

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,880
step back

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,800
look at something like hurricane

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,800
analysis right when you

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,440
look at uh something like hurricane

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,280
harvey uh we actually just look at the

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,560
little diagram um the box that

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,639
right in the middle here um this

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,840
rare factors that you have to look at in

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,120
the hurricane you have to look at the

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,240
wind you have to look at the ring you

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,919
have to look at the

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,520
uh the the tie um and how does

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,199
how does the scientist can quickly

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,680
understand how these parameters are

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,360
playing

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,960
together and they're not sitting

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,080
together remember we have distributed

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,800
archive across the

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,520
united states um but this tool we

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,720
actually built

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,759
is actually allow us to quickly you know

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,720
on the fly uh compare the

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,080
um the rain and also the the sea surface

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,160
temperature um

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,840
interactively and if you if you just

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,560
look at this look at this picture here

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,560
the little

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,160
light green uh light blue line here is

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,800
the rise of the precipitation or the

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,479
rain

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,160
and then you see the drop of the sea

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,080
cease riser temperature

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,240
right this is something we can do now on

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,720
the fly interactively using

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,160
um the solution that we've been

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,080
developing

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,319
uh come back to this one too where you

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,479
look at uh anomaly in the ocean

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,759
um some of this is some of the

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,879
well-documented

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:18,240
event where there was this warming

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:21,120
over at the coast of alaska

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,160
that causes huge impact to the marine

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,759
life

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,680
and it's anomaly because they don't know

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,319
what's going on what's causing it

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,240
and this solution a lot of the tools

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,360
that you're looking at allows to quickly

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,760
generate the the plot for the

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,039
anomaly on the ocean in terms of the

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,080
temperature

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,240
and the scientists can actually select

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,680
where's the peaks and you can they can

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,160
also overlay different

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,000
other measurements and then change the

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,519
the opacity of the data

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,120
to look at what's underneath because you

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,959
can stack the information

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,480
and then you can play the animation as

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,399
you can see the little area that i

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,920
selected is started turning red

00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,680
right this is where we are such a

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,519
well-known uh

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,959
a nominee that actually called the uh

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,680
the pacific bob

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,080
uh it caused huge uh marine uh death

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,320
right

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,600
under right here this is documented this

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,160
uh the wells

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,640
uh this is death and this is a bunch of

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,160
barriers

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,399
eating the the caucus of the fin whale

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,920
so we have tools that allow us to do

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,680
this now on the fly

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:26,399
um and same thing here

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,000
think about i live in california we have

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,760
right now we have lots of fires

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,080
uh but we also have time that we have

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,080
rains and we want to measure how the

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,680
the effects of the precipitation and

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,720
also how the rivers are

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,920
operating and this little church here

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,920
is really give us the summary of the 10

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,760
big rivers in southern california and

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,440
then we can overlay that

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,440
with the satellite observation for

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,120
precipitation and you can see how they

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,640
dance together right you see the little

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,800
blue line here this is the

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,000
massive rainfall and then you can follow

00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,600
by the massive uh

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,120
river discharge which is the red line

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,519
here right

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,240
we can this is actually give scientists

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,640
the tool

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,680
and the solution where they quickly uh

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,240
see how these

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,360
some of these physical observations that

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,839
can collect through

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,360
a cell light and also compare that with

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,800
subsurface measurement right

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,920
under uh the river now

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,079
for those of you who do not know about

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,000
how uh science works what this is how

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,839
you mix lots of juice right in the past

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,839
the scientists actually have to go to

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,360
the data archive they have to search for

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,240
the data they want they download the

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,640
data

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,720
um that could be depends on the size of

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,120
the data that they want like the

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,640
windows and then they have to basically

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,079
carve out most of the data is global

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,079
scale data so they might be

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,320
just collecting like carve out a piece

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,720
of that individual files

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,160
uh just the size of the file and the

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,040
number file varies

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,160
um then they have to provide the uh um

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,040
the computation

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,880
to generate the statistic for individual

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,320
chunks of the data that they computed

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,160
and then they overlay them together

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,920
right that's a lot of work um

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,680
and that's fine when you have small

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,360
amount of data well think about you have

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,440
petabyte scale data

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,399
right which it turns out i always become

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,200
the biggest

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,279
challenge um what we have been looking

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,040
at for the last few years is that well

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,880
well why don't this is a really cool

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,600
thing about um

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,279
then apache uh we did we started looking

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,079
at hadoop and then we started switch to

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,560
spark

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,000
right um by taking the data that earth

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,079
science data that we have collected to

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,200
the satellite we chunk it up by small

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:34,320
tiles store them into some kind of a

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,880
no sql database like cassandra right and

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,959
then

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,040
we index those data through spatial

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,160
indexes do these things like apache

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,760
solar

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,360
and then when somebody selects a region

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,320
we can just pull the chunks that

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,040
relevant to

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,519
that locations and then and then run

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,240
them

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,800
or compute them on our spark cluster

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,240
right just

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,560
creating a bunch of rdds right so

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,000
that's essentially what we have done um

00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,360
and um

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,680
the result is basically is amazing right

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,560
uh the this is a traditional method uh

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,320
when we did a

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,600
quick comparison on traditional method

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,279
of analysis takes about

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:14,320
20 minutes uh to compute uh analyze a

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:17,360
small 2.6 gigabyte of data right

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,440
uh but using these the uh

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,200
solutions which is building based on

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,760
apache solutions

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,720
um took us about two seconds uh to

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,839
compute

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,480
and that's volume now we are we're

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,480
talking about

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,160
you know doing some real science here

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,680
where you can do interactively rather

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,680
than doing batch oriented

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,720
solutions so we created this the apache

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,680
staff over the last few years

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,480
is being it's a it's a platform we call

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,279
it an analytic center platform

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,279
and the whole idea here is to provide a

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,120
harmonized environment where scientists

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,760
can go in and just

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,600
just basically compare different kind of

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,279
uh parameters or analysis

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,519
uh together without having to figure out

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,760
how to download and

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,720
slice the data and reproject the data

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,000
and all that

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,480
they don't have to do that they just use

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,160
simple web service apis uh the workflow

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,880
is really pulling the data through the

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,040
archives

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,959
um store it in the cloud-based analysis

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,320
storage and then create web services on

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,160
top of that and these are where these

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,240
scientific algorithms are

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,240
being managed and then we expose them to

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,720
simple web service api so that you can

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,040
create

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,880
gis applications uh you can create you

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,920
know using jupyter notebook and we also

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,920
supported the

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:34,399
s3s arcgis um the solution to

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,360
so far been evolving over time because

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,240
we are

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,800
working for different projects they have

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,959
different

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,320
budgets they have different needs not

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,839
everybody is going to run on the cloud

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,680
which i like them too but

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,120
they also have their own hardware all

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,800
right so we create a system

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,959
as an architecture where uh it's created

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,800
based on the facade of web service api

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:58,000
so you can run this in

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,240
uh on-prem cluster or on private cloud

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,440
or

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,120
amazon it's really based on the

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,880
requirement on the project and the kind

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,519
of data there there uh

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,120
they need uh but again to the user for

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,720
these applications is completely

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,720
transparent they have no idea

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,760
uh where this thing is actually running

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,079
and just like

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,680
you know you never have to take a cloud

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,040
computing class when you sign up for

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,399
gmail right so

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,600
same idea so we're really looking at

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,480
creating a platform

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,839
that enable collection of tools um and

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,720
rather than just creating like here's a

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,360
killer app i

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,160
looked a very nice shiny application you

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,560
want to create a

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,240
system where you can actually build

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,040
these applications on top of that where

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,320
we can really

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,800
allow scientists to explore the data

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,480
and to the point where you can actually

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,880
have full-blown

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,760
gis application running on uh your

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,279
browser or

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,680
on your phone right this is actually

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,160
something i like because i travel a lot

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,959
and i

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,000
actually test our own application while

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,160
i'm waiting for my

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,760
my flight and so i tested on my phone

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,279
and i find some bugs and i took a

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,120
screenshot and texted to my

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,320
uh my engineers like hey look at what i

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,079
found

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,760
it's actually been very productive i've

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,800
been actually being the

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,240
major tester of this application but

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,240
the cool thing about this is that you

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,639
can actually generate analysis you can

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,760
do animation you can jump to different

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,399
uh period because we have the speed

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,320
uh to do uh and the architecture allows

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,560
us to do that

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,079
so i come from a background where i can

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,320
do i've been doing a lot of

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,519
technology research um you know great

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,279
you know

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,680
i'm actually a personal investigator

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,000
various big data project at nasa

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,519
uh there's always a gap between the

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,959
technology research and pedagogy in

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,720
fusion because you can build something

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,560
really cool really fast

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,000
but the crowdfunding is that the project

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,480
may not have the funding

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,639
uh or they just say well the cost is too

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,519
much to operate in the cloud because

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,320
the growth of the data another thing is

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,399
some of the

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,320
real slices making in operation is that

00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,120
well what happens we shut down part of

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,000
the system

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,120
or how do we import new data without

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,519
taking things up

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,120
offline uh how do you manage the

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,440
priority of the jobs

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,600
um so those are the things that actually

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,839
really uh um

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,800
real questions uh for running science

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,199
mission because

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,639
you know and in science archives and uh

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,040
we can just say wipe everything and we

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,399
install

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,480
everything right because you talk about

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,240
massive amount of data

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,839
so um so we are looking at building

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,680
solution but not just

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,959
make it out there and say hey you know

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,360
this is really cool but

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,279
really looking at well how would people

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,839
use this and operationally

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,399
and what are the needs uh and how do

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,720
they

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,920
um um you know giving my background has

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,720
actually worked you know supporting

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,440
flight mission

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,880
for over the last 20 years uh those are

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,480
the things that this is really

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,920
site engineer may not think about they

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,600
just really think about well let's get

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,440
what we can do with gpu look at what we

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,680
have done with the uh spark

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,959
but some of the subtle questions really

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,639
have to think about is well when

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,959
somebody have to run this

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,639
uh they really have to figure out how to

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,039
uh keep the system moving without

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,640
shutting everything off

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:11,120
so we this is why we opened up apache

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,079
sdab or science data analytic platform

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,559
um

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,839
and uh actually we started the open

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,160
source actually started

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,120
in the 2017 but we've been there's a

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,000
history of this

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,240
uh evolution of this technology uh we

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,199
actually started working on the

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,240
uh how to analyze the satellite data um

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,280
starting back in us

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,000
august 2011 and we were using nebula and

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,240
if you

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,120
owe enough you know what nebula is right

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,640
um is

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,320
our little uh private cloud solutions uh

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,960
that nasa was trying to build

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,799
um and we we at that point uh we didn't

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,120
have spark yet right it was too early so

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,880
we use the hadoop and use hbase

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,960
we tried to use the point cloud and it

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,360
was great we were able to do some uh

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,400
you know analyze you know decades of

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,840
data uh

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,919
but we have to do some kind of back

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,520
joint processing for it

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,360
uh that was that shows like okay great

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,039
but it's just point clouds too expensive

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,080
to do for satellite data

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:09,600
um and we start evolving over time

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,520
uh to really move to 2014 where we start

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,880
taking at the ideas of well why do we

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,640
tile this stuff up

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,960
why don't we chunk it up so that we can

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,280
actually use this uh

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,720
really cool thing about apache spark

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,200
where we can actually run this up in

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,880
memory

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,679
and all i need is just a you know

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,720
cluster with high memories in there

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,039
so that's what we did in 2014 we got you

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,840
know

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,520
uh three big projects and then we also

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,000
established the nasa sea level trends

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,600
portal

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,760
uh which is one that's the nasa's

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,200
official response to the rise of the

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,520
ocean

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,640
where we can allow scientists to do

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,840
intricately

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:49,440
analyze different um parameters uh

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,440
relate to rice sea level rise and then

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,600
of course in 2017 we got our approval to

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,200
jpl to open sources stuff and

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,640
immediately we establish the step

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,320
because recognizing that we just don't

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,039
have the bandwidth to maintain this on

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,360
our own

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,200
uh we also know that we have expertise

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,880
on doing lots of ocean stuff but what

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,440
about the other parameters we really

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,720
want

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,520
the other community to contribute to the

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,840
algorithms

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,360
how do we support the different kind of

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,720
data formats

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,880
and open sources actually allow us to um

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,799
you know keep this thing moving as at

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,200
the same time i can go do something fun

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,840
right so uh that's the whole point if

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,440
you just

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,280
hang on to our technology then that

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,039
technology will die eventually

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,840
so um anyway so this is our

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,039
step website uh it's been 20 been about

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,480
three years now right

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,600
we're actually moving to the point where

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,600
we support um

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,919
in situ data matchups which is measuring

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,000
comparing satellite data with a

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,919
subservice measurement on the fly

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,120
uh with supporting things like arcgis

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,520
integrations

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,039
uh we're doing things like kubernetes

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,000
deployments

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,039
and um one thing that you don't know

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,640
about jpl

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,400
uh you know everybody think nasa is like

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,640
well that's nasa right everything has to

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,280
be

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,159
you know private top secrets um well

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,720
this

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,200
yes true we but that's the process that

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,240
we do

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,159
and and um and jpl actually being a

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,520
champion of open source for many many

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,559
years actually

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,799
um as i started uh over two decades ago

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,760
i

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:24,159
started uh contributing to some of the

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,120
open source projects like kerberos

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,799
so um so we do have a office that

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,480
actually streamlines the process

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:35,600
of open sourcing and we embrace the

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,880
uh the the apache version 2

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,520
license because it's very permissive um

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,039
we have over 100 jpl devops software is

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,919
now out in the open

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,640
not everyone is apache project but they

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,440
all

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,360
is available open source for anybody to

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,280
download

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,880
um this is actually my trophy right this

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,559
is just some of my trophy actually i've

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,280
been open sourcing software

00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,760
again for a long time now and it's just

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,960
a

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,400
simple email i got from our technology

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,600
transfer office right and

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,520
this is something that i actually frame

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,760
on my outside my office

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,559
um and this is a scoreboard that say hey

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,320
this is a

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,760
things that be improved and means that i

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,840
can actually take this out and i can

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,159
actually make it available to the public

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,760
um

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,200
and if you're interested you can also

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,400
find out a collection of

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,120
nasa open source project doodle

00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,840
software.nasa.gov

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,240
um building business is cool right we

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,000
say

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,320
we all try to build some technology ways

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,440
to try to put everything into uh

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,039
some common solutions uh and then have

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,600
all the data in one place

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,520
uh one big cloud um that's just not

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,520
gonna work with earth science right

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,039
i just showed you being the petabyte

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,520
scale missions now

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,679
um and it's just not feasible to think

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,640
about putting all the data in one place

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,200
right um and you know because when it's

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,960
the cost

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,559
second is that you don't have the domain

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,200
expert to support all these

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,320
different parameters so you know we

00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,520
should be moving to this direction

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,559
trying to build this

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,960
castle is is gonna fail all right

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,240
so what we have started this year uh

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,720
actually early this year

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,799
is like no why would we build a

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,039
community of these services

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,400
that giving them available uh have

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:17,360
access to you know

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,880
deploying a different instance of staff

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,200
one no

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,120
so that they have the domain experts how

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,600
to manage the data the services they

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,240
know how to do analysis on the data

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,640
and then all we need to do as user just

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,559
in

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,480
call these apis and then compare them

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,080
uh whatever can have rather than having

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,440
all the data into one place

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,880
and that's essentially what we have done

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,840
so over the last few years we

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,159
established

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,080
you know uh six different uh s-type

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,120
instances across the globe

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,679
um and this is the example of that we

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,760
built this

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,880
we run this in jupiter notebook where we

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,799
comparing

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,080
analysis from the c-level change portal

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,840
from nasa uh

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,080
and then from another project called the

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,559
echo uh it's not a nasa funded project

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,159
but it's a

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,760
completely different funding source

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,440
right um we were

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,520
able to do this on jupyter notebook

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,400
without having to move any data between

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,880
the system

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,400
right we just use comparison on them and

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,000
the bottom one is the same thing where

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,559
we comparing the grades follow on

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,480
mission

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,919
uh which is uh for measure for

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,080
measurement for gravity

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,440
uh with ocean bottom pressure data from

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,360
another system

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,880
right the cool thing about this is that

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,480
i don't have to replicate these stuff

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,480
all over the place anymore i just call

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,320
this api and since i know they're there

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,280
and they pay for the computation i don't

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,600
pay for it

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,120
um but they the whole idea here is

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,400
though because the way how the

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,720
software is configured is that this the

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,080
the operator of the system know exactly

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,679
what's the growth rate so they know

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,159
exactly how much it's gonna cost them

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,760
uh so it's not like out of scaling and

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,039
also you just find yourself you're

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,240
running run out of money

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,520
right so um so we have a community of

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,240
the service

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,559
uh system now and the the current effort

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,760
is

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,520
moving into a wider global scale so one

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,919
of the effort that we're involving in

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,880
is the community on earth observing cell

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,360
like really

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,960
bridging different archive for different

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,919
agencies together

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,360
and we are working on infusing um the

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,080
step over at the

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:17,840
uh um site which is in germany uh that

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,200
we can compare data between nasa and the

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,200
esa data

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,240
interactively which we have done before

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,039
we demonstrate that

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,919
work so now they are we're working on

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,480
getting this

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,840
up and running this is a it's a private

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,799
cloud environment they don't run on

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,440
amazon

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,200
it's very a customized environment

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,400
whereas the nasa versions actually runs

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,480
on amazon but again

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,400
because it's everything based on apis

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,600
it's completely in

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:47,039
to the user who built these applications

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:50,720
um so we also created the plugin where

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,520
we can use s3 arcgis to connect to step

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,840
instance so

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,039
this is actually example where we can

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,320
pull having an

00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:01,120
s3 uh software talking to different

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,200
uh like center or app uh where we can do

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,520
interactively

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,679
uh if you don't know about history is a

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,679
for-profit organization right they

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,880
you know they're actually the leader in

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,520
doing gis work

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,039
it's also proprietary solutions so

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,679
sometimes it's very challenging to move

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,799
all

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,440
nasa free and open data to a proprietary

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,679
solution

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,960
and justify know what's the long-term

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,000
cause of this thing

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,799
well with this solution you don't have

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,600
to because

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,720
step is free right so we have a service

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
actually runs in different archives

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,600
center

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,799
uh and then you have a plugin that runs

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,600
under arcgis

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,279
where they that allow the user of rgs

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,000
can talk to these instances

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,440
and still get the same nasa data

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,520
analysis respond

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,440
but not only that they because they're

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,520
in arcgis now they can overlay

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,360
their own favorite maps or their other

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,640
analysis they can even compare that with

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,960
the nasa data

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,960
right so this plugin is also available

00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,880
through the uh the

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:03,919
apache software um distributions

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,480
um no data downloads no data wrangling

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,159
means like

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,320
projection subsettings and all that

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:11,840
stuff or you know

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:14,000
ends up just simple restful apis so

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,360
building the community is actually uh

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,080
what i enjoy doing

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,400
uh because i get to meet different

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,440
people different scientists you get to

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,919
um learning about the pain

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,640
and we host friendship on hands-on

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,640
workshops

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,240
right that's exactly one of them we post

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,120
about two years ago at the

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,400
uh when the conference uh was a full

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,799
house event

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,240
uh where people get their own aws

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,559
instance then they get to launch their

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,919
own

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,919
for their notebook they could do

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,559
instructive analysis they get to do all

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,880
that in

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,679
less than two hours that was pretty cool

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,840
um

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,679
and then we actually go off and uh

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,679
present events all right this is when

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,559
the recent event i presented

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,120
the uh the ocean sciences meeting um but

00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,880
we're also

00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:01,279
meeting with our science uh partners

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,559
um the whole idea is figure out what are

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,000
they what do they need right you don't

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,400
want to just build something and say hey

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,880
you know

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,720
it's cool take it right uh you really

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,679
want to see what am i solving the right

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,400
problem

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,799
um i also also like this picture a lot

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,279
and

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:17,120
um and the final reason for that is if

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:20,799
you

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,720
just actually represent three um

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,080
people from different disciplines uh the

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,200
gentleman on the far

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,240
is he's a project scientist okay and the

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,279
gentleman's uh

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,000
closer here he's a system architect

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,600
and the young lady right in the middle

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,679
she's a software engineer

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,200
right so they all work together and this

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,960
is actually what i call the dream team

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,960
they can actually come together they

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,520
they're looking at the same

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,200
analysis and they actually can say hey

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,600
what can we do with the system

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,279
uh with this uh data that we now we can

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,640
easily slice and dice them

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:56,320
um right so um

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,840
again though we're not just building

00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,760
this as jpl uh this

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,679
we do have a growing community and this

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,559
is actually like

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,440
i'm keeping track of a list of people um

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:10,559
have been supporting us over the last uh

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,840
um you know four or five and years uh

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:16,159
actually more than that um and uh

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,960
they are some of them contribute lots of

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,679
source codes

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,000
uh some contribute scientific ideas and

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,240
and

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,760
uh giving us guidance in terms of the

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,760
expertise in terms how to work with the

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,240
data that they have and

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,720
some is just basically uh giving us the

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,960
technology recommendations

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:39,440
so uh in summary um this is actually um

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,720
you know what i'm a big fan of futures

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,559
right the book and

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,000
really when we we don't just want to

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,960
build one little things here this is

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,039
really cool

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,880
we want to start building these system

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,399
where it we are building block to the

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,760
bigger system so

00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,600
this is something that i'm teaching my

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,200
engineer to making sure to see a bigger

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,760
picture of this instead of just say one

00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,559
little

00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,039
nugget um climate research is a big data

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,559
challenge

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,080
right you don't want to think about

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,760
putting all the data in one place you

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,679
really want to create a community of

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,279
this open source solution

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,360
where they support different discipline

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,960
where you can easily compare and

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,640
uh the analysis without having to move

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,360
data across the wires

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,799
um but because of the big data it has to

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,399
be sustainable it has to be

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:23,520
uh automated and we really

00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:25,440
focus on building the open source uh

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,520
it's not a final thing like once you

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,880
build it okay dump it it's really when

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,159
you when we start the project

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,159
we already think about let's make it

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,399
open source uh because

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,440
we really hate to see a lot of stovepipe

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,919
solution out there

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,520
at least we once we make the software

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,559
available to the public

00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,360
uh like a european partner right um now

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,279
they're willing to

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,200
be really more open to discuss because

00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,480
there's like oh nasa owned this stuff or

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,120
jpr owned this thing or

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,720
thomas all this stuff but there's really

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,279
no apache on this stuff

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,840
right so uh the conversation is much

00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,240
different

00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,240
once you move to internet uh when we're

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,080
building architecture we're also looking

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,679
at generalization from spiritualization

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,360
right we don't believe in creating a

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,960
a basic recreating like

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,399
technology just because you want to make

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,480
it more portable like you know

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,720
but who would want to reinvent lambda

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,399
right if you saw the lambda on amazon

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,399
right so you want to great create

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,840
generalization which is the api level

00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,279
and then you have the specialization

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,960
means you want to take advantage of the

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,240
hosting environment so that you can

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,440
manage the cost

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:30,559
uh much more intelligently so

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:34,000
um and again you know it's been very fun

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:36,159
uh you know i think this apache

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,360
sdap has actually been making great

00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,720
impact across

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:43,840
nasa and across our international

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,080
partners and i think open source moving

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,000
it

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,120
to open source is actually is the the

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,600
best thing because

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,440
you know we actually allow people to

00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,240
contribute and evolve the technology

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,200
rather than

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,799
you know pointing to one person or one

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,159
organization and these are the two big

00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:01,039
missions that we're flying

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,919
one is a lower right is actually will be

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,200
launched next year

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,000
uh expect to generate about 23 petabytes

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,039
of data

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
um and one of the up is actually will be

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,320
the year follow

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,600
uh again this is massive power by scale

00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,360
missions

00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:19,600
okay thanks a lot for having me uh this

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,960
question feel free to email me and thank

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,080
you so much thomas for

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,919
for your presentation and uh

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,360
i would i would love to chat more with

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,559
you about this but we have to move right

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,799
on to the next

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,240
the next uh keynote this morning but uh

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:44,159
i hope to catch up with you some more

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:44,159
