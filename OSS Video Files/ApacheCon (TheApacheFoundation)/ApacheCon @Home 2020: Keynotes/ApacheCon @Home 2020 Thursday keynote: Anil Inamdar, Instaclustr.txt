Description: 
	A Rising Tide Lifts All Boats: Working With Contributors of All Sizes

Anil Inamdar, Head of US Consulting and Delivery, Instaclustr


The Open source development model has changed significantly since its heydays in the 1990s. Today there are more projects, more contributors, additional financing and vendors of various kinds – support, add-ons, cloud providers. The Apache community still continues to play a pivotal role in promoting open source projects, setting community standards, providing framework for arbitrations and ensuring quality for the projects.


Participations from contributors of all sizes – individual, company affiliated, and vendor supported act as the rising tide and help expand the open source market. The key however is to ensure that we contribute back to the project and the foundation. Working together creates a rising tide lifting its participants. As the saying goes – “If you want to go fast, go alone; but if you want to go far, go together.”

support redis now

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,800
at the bottom we have all the cloud and

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,440
on-prem

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,840
on-prem platforms for deployment in the

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,319
middle

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,560
we we have all the services that we

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,800
provide um provisioning

monitoring scaling security backup

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
recovery

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,800
all right so let's get on with the topic

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,519
of the day today

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,080
a rising tide lifts all boats working

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,840
with

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,760
contributors of all sizes now the phrase

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,360
uh rising tide lifts all boats is a

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,920
familiar one

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,040
used in stock market sports and other

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,040
domains

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,159
now how does it apply to open source

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,280
technology

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,920
let's find out now before we

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,080
um talk about open source technologies

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,280
let's look at a very familiar industry

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,000
the auto industry um us took the lead in

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,040
auto industry

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,680
starting in the early 1900s

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,040
henry ford's assembly line and model t

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,640
was a revolution

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,760
it made cars both popular and affordable

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,480
this in turn started a chain reaction

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,720
the highway act of 1921 focused on

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,400
construction constructing roads

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,959
rockefeller standard oil and other

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,000
refineries found a new source of

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,000
a source of consumers the car tourism

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,040
something we take for granted now

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,760
was kicked off around that time travel

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,040
required

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,400
gas station motels fast foods

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,799
there were hundreds of complimentary

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,720
businesses and businesses and services

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,080
that the auto industry kicked off

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,439
uh tires and radio and aaa all of these

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,160
diverse industries

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,160
did one thing

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,320
they all helped grow the auto industry

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,479
the us

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,240
and then the global auto market grew by

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,840
leaps and bounds

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,080
it is still continuing the rising tide

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,120
of different domains working together

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,600
the government

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,479
auto manufacturers oil producers

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,000
ancillary car industries

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,440
like we discussed tire radio oem motels

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,160
gas station

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,800
lifted everyone involved the cons the

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,479
consumers and the market for every

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,479
industry grew with this collaboration

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,360
now we may not be able to directly

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,960
compare the u.s auto market with the

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,199
open source market

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,560
but there are several parallels so let's

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,320
uh quickly review the progression of the

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,199
open source ecosystem

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,320
to set the right context um now there

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,360
are no hard dates

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,639
but in 1990s there was a revolution in

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,440
the software

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,960
it was primarily against the closed uh

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,400
source community

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,240
individual collaborators worked

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,160
asynchronously on projects that they

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,680
were passionate about

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,160
the initial licensing model was

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,880
completely free with the caveat that

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,400
there may not be support or an immediate

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,080
fix to a bug

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:37,039
linux and mysql are two good examples

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,240
the next wave started somewhere in 2000

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,800
i'm calling it the

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,280
um the expansion the software in this

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,840
case

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,720
was built with commercial customers in

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,639
mind

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,320
it was typically developed in a company

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,400
in the beginning and was

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,560
later moved to a foundation like hadoop

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,080
what started in yahoo kafka in linkedin

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,120
cassandra and facebook the core software

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,639
was free but

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,800
several vendors started offering

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,840
enhancements and could charge licensing

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,919
fees

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,600
along with enhancements these vendors

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,880
also supported their version of the

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,800
product

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,880
the current wave is going off going

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,960
after enterprise customers

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,240
the cloud is playing an integral part of

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,639
the offering

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,440
in this way the software contributors

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,600
are primarily from commercial businesses

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,039
the licensing model is like the

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,199
expansion phase

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,639
but the cloud vendors have their own

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,720
twists

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,319
there are more players in the market

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,680
vendors working on the software and

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,680
custom features

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,880
companies supporting their core business

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,680
with the technology and therefore

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,560
contributing

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,880
heavily cloud vendors offering managed

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,440
services for these technologies

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,080
also open source has become an integral

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,199
part of

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:51,280
every organization's enterprise strategy

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,360
so with the new dynamics in the market

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,479
do individual open source projects and

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,280
the foundation

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,720
have a role to play the answer is a

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,960
resounding yes

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,560
the foundation continues to define and

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,919
enhance the objectives of the open

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,199
source community

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,360
the foundation also sets standards

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,960
developmental operational it also

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,440
provides unbiased

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,639
arbitration framework the foundation

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,039
also helps

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,160
evangelize a critical project a project

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,080
really kicks off

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,400
when the foundation is behind it the

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,639
foundation in many cases provides

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,440
project infrastructure jira birds issue

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,400
tracking cicd maining list

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,680
it also provides ip and trademark

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,840
protection

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,720
apart from all this the project and the

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,680
foundation play

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,680
another key role

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,560
the individual projects and the

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,720
foundation are also the mothership

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,479
for all open source contributor

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,720
contributors

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,599
contributors of all sizes and types

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,599
large businesses

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,680
cloud providers technology vendors

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,919
supporters manage service providers

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,800
continue to contribute to many projects

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,960
thereby

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,319
helping directly or indirectly to the

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,400
foundation

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:07,360
now um let's take let's take an example

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,759
so our company started with uh cassandra

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,520
so

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:14,080
i'll take that example um

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,240
was initially developed in facebook it

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,400
was released as an open source project

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:23,520
on on google in 2008

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,199
in 2009 it became an apache incubator

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,000
project

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,160
in february 2010 it was graduated to a

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,080
top-level project

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,000
cassandra is currently used for mission

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,240
critical application

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,200
at various companies today companies

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,760
like netflix

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,440
and apple are contributing to the

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,120
project primarily supporting their

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,120
internal requirements but benefiting the

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,959
entire community

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,160
vendors like data stacks offering

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,480
proprietary features

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,360
also contribute to the project they are

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,680
developing both

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,920
common features for the community as

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,560
well as proprietary features

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,000
similarly my company insta cluster also

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,959
contributes to the project

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,200
so far we have contributed over 100

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,959
patches and currently working on several

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,240
new patches including a key

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,760
functionality transparent data

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,480
encryption tde

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,839
this feature is required by several

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,519
banks and other

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,120
enterprise clients apart from these

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,880
contributors there are several

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,959
individual contributors who are

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,120
contributing to the project

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,640
some of the most widely used features

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,200
were started as suggestions

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,320
from individual contributors when a

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,480
suggestion is good

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,680
the community gets behind the feature

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,160
and some of the biggest names

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,959
like netflix or apple or uber

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,440
participant in testing and benchmarking

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,760
this is no doubt creates a great feeling

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,399
for the individual contributor

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,120
the project and the foundation create 11

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,600
level playing

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,120
field for contributors of every size and

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,040
type

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,880
netflix and apple may be competing on

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,000
certain streaming services or other

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,839
applications

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,680
but when it comes to contributing to the

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,240
project and the foundation

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,279
they don't care data stacks and insta

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,120
cluster

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,320
our competitors on some of the services

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,240
that we provide

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,920
but when it comes to contributing to the

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,040
project and the foundation

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,000
we don't care whether the contributor is

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,000
a heavyweight

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,040
in the industry or just an individual

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,880
contributor

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,880
the community does not care

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:27,600
now contributors of different sizes

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,000
also create a lot of conflicts now let's

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,880
take

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,959
uh product growth as an example now some

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,120
of the giants in the market

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,880
want to focus their contributions on

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,560
stability

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,959
they may not be too keen on adding new

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,120
features similarly

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,800
there are vendors who are interested in

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,480
enhancing the product and want to add

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,000
tons of features

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,839
now this is a real life example

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,519
happening right now

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,839
another example is a way cassandra is

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,920
deployed there are certain giants

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,200
who want the public cloud support while

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,240
there are others who prefer

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,120
deployment in their own data centers

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,959
now we talked about individual

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,880
contributors on the previous slide

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,560
one might think that an individual

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,519
contributor may be sidelined by the

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,360
giants

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,600
but i wanted to provide some specific

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,560
examples of their contributions

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,880
for standard project python 3 migration

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,200
cassandra 4.2 documentation

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,079
sql sh bug fixes these are also some

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,839
good examples

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,320
where individual contributors have

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,399
played a good role

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,640
so the conflicts that i talked about

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,200
ultimately end up benefiting the entire

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,320
community

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,279
and cassandra user base we get both

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,640
stability and features we get support

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,120
for both public cloud

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,000
as well as your own data centers on top

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,680
of all this there

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,440
are several features picked up by

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,160
individual contributors

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,200
and ultimately the entire cassandra

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,000
community

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,000
is benefited

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,279
now why do contributors of all sizes

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,200
willing to work together

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,880
the reason is that there are more people

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,079
more businesses more vendors

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,680
more contribute more more contributes to

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,519
the project

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,360
uh there are many open source projects

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,440
today in the market um

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,680
in every domain of technology from

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,360
devops to itunes operations to data to

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,079
analytics

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,120
the the contribution is not only code

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,720
okay there are many kinds of

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,279
contributions that are necessary for

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,200
projects

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,279
code reviews preparing a release

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,120
translation utilities documentation

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,200
infrastructure facilities

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,240
the open source code base is growing as

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,240
you can see from the graph

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,639
so what has happened to the open source

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,000
market and the revenue news as you can

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,560
see from the graph

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,760
again uh it is it has been growing

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,600
steadily

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,200
for the past 12 to 15 12 to 15 years ago

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,600
open source was still considered

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,720
a risky strategy by enterprise customers

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,120
but today

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,040
open source is a critical component of

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,839
every enterprise strategy

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,720
open source has transitioned from labs

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,760
and experience

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,440
experiments to board rooms ceos define

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,279
their competitive edge

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,639
through the use of open source while the

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,800
cfos look at

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,800
open source to reduce costs without

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,959
adding additional risks

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,120
open source is embraced by all kinds of

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,560
businesses companies of different sizes

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,360
companies with different business models

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,519
collaborators partners competitors

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,440
companies that have just started their

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,839
journey with open source are companies

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,440
that are veterans this has created a

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,760
virtuous cycle

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,800
more adaption they gets more usage we

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,279
get more products

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,360
we get more adoption a rising tide

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,000
lifting all boats

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,880
so in summation the key to success for

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,199
open source

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,720
is to work together and to continue to

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,839
contribute back to the projects and

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,199
foundation

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,040
we saw what happened to the auto

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,920
industry when multiple domains started

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,160
working together

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,839
and towards a common goal the auto

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,800
market continued to grow for the past

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,720
100 years

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,320
we can do the same thing for open source

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,320
market and ecosystem

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,079
but of course with much reduced impact

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,079
to the environment

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,120
no contribution is small it's like a

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,800
political campaign

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,720
there are always big donors but

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,120
individual donors collectively

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,199
play a big role and in some cases like

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,360
obama's 2008 campaign

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,279
a significant role you can be a small

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,560
company or you can be a large company

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,440
you can be a collaborator or a

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,199
competitor

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,680
working on one project or multiple

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,399
project if we keep the projects and the

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,720
foundation

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,639
above our selfish market and economic

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,519
goals we will all benefit

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,160
a rising tide lifts all boats i want to

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,120
end with an

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,160
african proverb if you want to go fast

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,880
go alone

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,320
but if you want to go far go together so

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,560
let's go far

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,079
thank you i also encourage you to stop

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,880
by our cluster booth

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:49,199
to get a dollar 25 gift card from amazon

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,120
thank you so much

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:59,839
thank you very much anil for that for

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:59,839
that message

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,320
