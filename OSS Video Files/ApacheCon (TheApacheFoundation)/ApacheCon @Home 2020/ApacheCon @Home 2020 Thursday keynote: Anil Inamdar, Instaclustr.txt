Description: 
	A Rising Tide Lifts All Boats: Working With Contributors of All Sizes

Anil Inamdar, Head of US Consulting and Delivery, Instaclustr


The Open source development model has changed significantly since its heydays in the 1990s. Today there are more projects, more contributors, additional financing and vendors of various kinds – support, add-ons, cloud providers. The Apache community still continues to play a pivotal role in promoting open source projects, setting community standards, providing framework for arbitrations and ensuring quality for the projects.


Participations from contributors of all sizes – individual, company affiliated, and vendor supported act as the rising tide and help expand the open source market. The key however is to ensure that we contribute back to the project and the foundation. Working together creates a rising tide lifting its participants. As the saying goes – “If you want to go fast, go alone; but if you want to go far, go together.”
