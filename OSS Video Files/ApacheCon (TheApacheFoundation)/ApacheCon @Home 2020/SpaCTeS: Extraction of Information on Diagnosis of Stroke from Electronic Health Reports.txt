Most of the relevant data produced on stroke clinical settings consist of unstructured data (clinical narrative texts in Electronic Health Records (EHR). We tested new TM techniques to assist in the process of extracting relevant information from hospital discharge reports of patients diagnosed with a stroke (2016 to 2017). We developed a TM pipeline structured into iterative phases to gradually improve the quality of transforming narrative discharge reports into structured clinical data representations and generating good practice recommendations. The initial system was developed using Apache cTAKES, a natural language processing for information extraction from the EHR system initially developed by the Mayo Clinic. The main challenge was the heterogeneity of source data (3000 documents in Spanish and Catalan from 28 different hospitals). We developed an analysis tool to test the quality of texts by identifying missing information and non-standard usage of notations and vocabularies. The system also produced a normalized version of the texts. These results allowed us a detailed analysis of the stroke narrative records and the identification of aspects such as heterogeneity (and its problems) and degree of standardization, all of which are critical to enabling better exploitation of the information contained in EHR by TM approaches.

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,000
okay

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,680
hello everyone that's in the audience i

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,040
think we're about it time to begin

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,399
so see mac if you are me

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,280
yeah excellent thank you hi alan so

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,320
i'm siamek basica from the boston super

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,039
coming center

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,680
and tax mining unit so i'm today i'm

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,320
going to

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,640
speak about our tools as practice that

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,120
is the extraction of the informations

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,239
on the diagnosis of struck from a

00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,399
spanish electric

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,399
uh economic health reports

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,720
so uh so especially spanish clinical tax

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,920
money

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:13,760
systems uh we want that

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,080
to develop an intro interoperable

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,680
text mining system to assist in the

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,400
process of extraction

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,560
extracting relevant information from

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,600
hospitals discharge reports

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,759
of the patient diagnosed by israel and

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,040
gradually improve the quality of

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,880
transforming

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,920
narrative discharge reports into

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,720
structure clinical data

00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:40,400
representations and finally

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,040
generating good practice recommendations

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,159
so let me first speak about what is the

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,000
text mining

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,600
so something that is very similar to

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,240
each other data mining and

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,799
takes money so demonic for the money

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,560
beneath

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:57,680
structured data that usually are in the

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,200
numeric form but takes money uh

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,040
in the text money we deals with

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,320
unstructured data

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,799
in form of natural language data

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,520
and also uh in the text manager with

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,239
retrieve

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,520
what is hidden in the text and present

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,319
distilled knowledge

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,599
in concise form and also discover an

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,959
extract knowledge from unnecessary data

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:24,319
and also be it's like non-trivial

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:27,280
informations of new information

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,560
from natural language data collections

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,400
and also it takes

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,080
money applications into great natural

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,080
language processing components

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,280
such as document retrieval

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,120
classifications

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,800
and so on in the

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,120
text money photoshop as you can see in

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,519
the picture so we sort with the

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,640
unassociated data and after that we do

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,120
some uh

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,400
update some components such information

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,879
retrieval

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,160
or name entity reconnections and

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,360
information acceleration

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,319
so until we get the knowledge discovery

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,720
from the

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:05,680
resource another thing that is important

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,319
in the uh in domain the difference

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,760
between biomedical domain or data

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,959
and the clinical one and as you can see

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,800
in the in the this table

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,879
the document from the medical and

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,840
clinical domain usually are early

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,879
clinical health

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,239
records or the medical intelligence

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,959
or drug labors and so on or clinical

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,200
traits

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,799
and on the other hand the biomedical or

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,480
biology

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,200
documents or scientific literature or

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,720
free text

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,120
in another database and for the language

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,760
so

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,080
in the led core or clinical world it can

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,239
be any language

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,000
is related to the country that is we

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,080
want to get information from them

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,159
but for the biomedical and biology

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,080
mostly english

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,680
and the difficult and challenge for the

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,120
especially for the medical and credit

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,480
card is the

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,720
use heavily abbreviations and also

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,400
we have a lot of misspelling and toy

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,040
butter and also this

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,519
lack of the punctuation marks there and

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,799
also

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,760
the game decor problem in the sentence

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,840
and another important part it is privacy

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,239
in the clinical generation that we don't

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,280
have

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,759
that much in the biomedical

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,040
parts they have some resolution but is

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,520
mostly for copyright but for the

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,840
medical is the privacy and

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,960
computationality

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,680
and so uh the most that are especially

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,479
in the

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,120
spanish corporate clinical harassment is

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,199
mostly

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,800
eighty percent of health data is

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,639
unnecessary data

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,360
and for the spain from the population of

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,880
the 2.7 million people

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,040
we every day we have 200 000 clinical

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,520
notes

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,080
so let's speak with the data that we

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,840
have it

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:03,360
uh for the our case

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:06,880
uh for the so we have two different uh

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,280
structure data so one of the uh

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,639
uh digital summaries from the aquas that

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,360
is from the 26th

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:17,440
hospitals so we have around the two uh

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:20,240
2700 uh

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,199
discharge summaries from the aquas and

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,039
also we have around

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,800
600 reports from the sparse hospital

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,000
so you can see the percentage of each

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,120
hospital and so we did some analysis

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,240
in the data that we have so

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,039
a minimum if you see in this table the

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,199
first row is the minimum of the

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,160
number of the tokens that this was the

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,080
28s

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,759
and for example for the last column is

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,680
the number of sentences it was

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,199
the minimum was two and the maximum was

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,360
the number of the sentences it was five

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,560
hundred five hundred seventy

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,560
everything is three so is the

00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,680
some information of the date of the

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,520
habit

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,840
and uh uh also it's not uncommon

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,680
for the same discharge summary to be

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,360
writing by different doctors

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,160
and or nurses which explain the mixture

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,360
of the languages in the same document in

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,639
bilingual

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,479
regions for example here the the

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,039
gray highlight is in the catalan the

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:26,479
rest is in the spanish

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,919
language and or sometimes it can happen

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:32,240
the english also same

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:34,960
sentence in the uh ethical history pose

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,000
and another problem it is from the

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,680
reports that we get

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,680
uh usually they have to write a

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,759
different section in the different parts

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,160
but usually they don't they don't follow

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,600
these

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,880
structures or if this mix of the

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,080
different sections so it's very

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,639
important to

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,720
find which uh sentence or programs

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,560
related to which sections

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,919
is the challenge that we have uh to

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,120
address

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,360
uh so let me uh explain again what we

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,720
want to do so we wanted to

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,039
have a text mining tools that serves

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,840
as a link between the hospital and the

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,680
primary

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,840
care systems to reduce the time of spend

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,039
explaining the search for information

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,319
and also

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,599
dublication diagnostics and unnecessary

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,240
visit and also

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,960
medical error also reduce all of them

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,680
and also

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,240
these tools is also useful for research

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,319
and

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,479
management and the quality of the care

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,520
analysis

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:38,639
so for this task that we wanted to

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,599
uh implemented we use the syntax

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,800
framework

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:46,560
that sean yesterday explained but this

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,879
is it so i don't go to details and so

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,319
so for this reason we have to use

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,680
several components

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,400
to reach uh this code that i explained

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,120
uh

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,879
the thesis how we integrate because we

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,080
don't have these tools

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,280
in the sytex native cities component

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,319
but we integrated them to syntax and so

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,879
one of them is

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:12,080
the free rings wrapper that we have the

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,639
sentence token uh we use a sentence

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,639
detector and also the tokenizer and

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,759
posterior and dependency and the lemon

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,400
from the fuel rings

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,319
wrapper component and also for the

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,280
header tom

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:28,639
uh that is the extra for it is useful

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,800
what is like temporal expressions

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,399
and you can see here the output of the

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,399
header tongue for example because

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,440
for the header thumb yeah it needs to

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,399
pose

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,159
attacker from the furious wrapper and

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,360
and also tokenizer of course

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,839
uh so is is the output of the hidden

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,240
time

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,519
and also we normalize it in the some

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,320
specific format

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,320
that you can see in the notes tag

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:59,920
and uh another one is

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,680
the uh four's additional lookup

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,080
that you can see here we have the three

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,560
columns uh the first one is the snom net

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,839
code

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,399
and the second is the archetypes

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,760
the the type of the we want to use it

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,839
and also the variance

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,399
of the information as you can see here

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,040
in the the second table

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,800
in there for example in the uh last row

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,600
that you can see we have the type

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,959
cranial

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,399
but there is a a typo problem that is

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,279
especially between i

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,120
and l but the first additionally lookup

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,399
can't detect it

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,360
as the titanium and it's the same for

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,680
the rest if you

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,800
see the some example if it doesn't have

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,839
the accent or

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,760
hazard or these some replacement between

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:47,680
them so it can't detect them

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:51,760
that i explained it uh last time

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:54,560
and is the output of the the

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,640
the tools that we use as acetics hdmi

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,920
and also we added some

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,279
method for the breadth output and so

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,360
here i'm going to

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:08,399
first explain uh problems

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,880
for the some variables so

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,240
if we have several types of annotations

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,120
that we want to detect

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,279
such as a date time and deductances and

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,240
associate variables or also ranking

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:23,839
variables and procedures and treatment

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,839
but the problem mostly

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,760
not mostly but also we have the problem

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,079
for the sound ranking variables

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,120
that is for the in banking and the means

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,480
here

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,800
that the problem is for this ranking

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,440
variables we have a formula for their

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,640
sql

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,440
sqls which cause them to not be fully

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,160
or correctly annotated and they don't

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,480
have any

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,519
specific pattern as you can see here we

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,200
have the several

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:54,320
formats for these numbers with escorts

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,040
and so it's a bit tricky to

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,040
correctly the ruby system expand all of

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,839
them

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,640
uh so in order to evaluate our system

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,320
performance

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:09,839
we annotated a third of all data that is

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:13,200
was around 850 reports after

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,360
discarding irrelevant ripples and

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,440
erythritol has reports were experienced

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,000
in 10 punches

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,600
uh the first six bunches that was around

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,920
the 500 rupees

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:29,519
were doubly annotated by four experts

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:32,480
so that internal inter another argument

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,000
could be monitored the uh the shared

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,560
manual annotations between the

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,839
unorthodox were compared together and

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,880
these agreements were resolved either by

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,680
reconciling the manual annotations or by

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,880
amending the looper systems

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,720
as we shown you this table uh for the

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,079
the first six punches

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,639
you can see uh internal and interactive

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,240
analytical argument score before and

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,920
after of the consensus

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,959
between annotators the the law

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:08,160
intel and annotator agreement uh escorts

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:10,399
showing the complexes of this some

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,800
spanish a typical history boss for the

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,800
nero

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,959
and also here you can see the average of

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,240
the number of added

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:23,440
and the change that is we

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,959
only uh it happened only for if the the

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,079
annotators change the

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:31,120
uh the span of the

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,720
the annotation annotations and also the

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,040
accepted annotations

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,959
so i will repeat again if i don't

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,519
explain it well so the first column is

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,639
the added

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,600
that is show the cons the annotations

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,240
added by human annotators and the change

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,720
one is

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,480
called is the pre-annotations modified

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,040
by human analytic source

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,880
with expand as i said for the knees or

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,639
some is score

00:12:52,880 --> 00:13:00,160
a variable that is very hard to correct

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,639
the old scores so they change the span

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,200
and the accepted column is the cons is

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,639
the pre-annotations accepted

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,320
the corresponds by ruby systems so over

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,639
time you can see the number of the

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,760
acceptance of the piano chains

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,760
have been increased

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,399
and so as i said the first 500

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,200
have been used for improving the ruby

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:28,480
systems and the last four punches

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:32,000
that it was around the 350 ripples

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,920
were used to evaluate the robust system

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,120
and

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:42,079
system uh against the manual annotations

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,600
uh the for the ruby system it it is

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,800
tough to detect just

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,800
11 variables for the diagnosis

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,839
and procedural variables as you can see

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,279
here

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,320
because of the massive opportune variety

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,600
of the variable

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,920
and the headers in the reports because

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,440
sometimes we have to only detect some

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,720
directions in the

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,000
specific sections or so on but the ruby

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,160
systems

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,480
sometimes is to take everything in the

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,160
the whole the electric case reports

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,079
sometimes it's easy to find okay it's

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,560
happening on reverse specification but

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,519
sometimes it's not easy to find

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,360
where it happen so for reason the escrow

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,959
is not very verb

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,959
and so the main contributions it was the

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,480
development and adaptation of the

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,639
component in the cities for

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,639
spanish and also address the

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,160
interpretability issues that i explained

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,880
it yesterday

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,440
and analysis of the narrative records

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,839
and the

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,000
identification of aspects such as the

00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:45,440
heterogeneity

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,880
and also its program and of course it is

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,279
open source

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,480
uh we are using uh deep learning

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,560
approaches and

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,639
we want to compare the result with the

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,600
long processes step for the loop based

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,639
systems

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,519
because for the sum uh variables

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,279
is very easy to do it with the ruby

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,320
assistance because it's easy to find

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,040
pattern

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,360
but for some of them is very hard as you

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,480
can

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,360
you saw it in the last uh slice that

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,600
accuracy was low so we want to use the

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,639
deep learning approach to see

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:22,160
how is going to be and

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:25,360
uh this source

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:28,399
is also is available in the all github

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,920
and you can have access to it

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,199
easily and yeah that's it and thank you

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,040
so much for

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,240
listening and i will be happy if you

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,839
have answered to

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,839
your questions

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,519
okay so it looks like uh well first uh

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,560
thank you very much that was

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:57,600
great there's a question regarding

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,480
uh using catalan and spanish in the same

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,000
note

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:05,759
yeah how you handle that so uh

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,360
so so we used in the originally

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:11,839
lookup so usually we have to

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,519
the the variables for the different

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,720
languages so if you have the

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,600
so here because we have the catalon and

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,639
also we have the

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,440
spanish so we in the off first edition

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,360
dictionary we put it the balls together

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,839
and also we have used some library for

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,079
the

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,040
languages so to know which of them is

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,079
the better so

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,399
we mostly because it was clear uh the

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,519
the words that we wanted to use i mean

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,759
in the dictionary

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,519
that we want to detect so it's all so we

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,920
have the version of the catalan and also

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,240
for

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,519
a spanish version so we put it in the

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,839
false that we want to

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,639
in the dictionary first additionally uh

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,839
so we

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,839
uh predict them

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,959
thank you so i think the next question

00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,120
is

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,240
during the evaluation process what

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,839
configuration changes were the most

00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,839
significant between batches

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:17,439
for instance adding acronyms yeah but

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,439
for during processing composition change

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,600
so uh mostly we changed only the

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,400
ordinary

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,280
uh files that we wanted to annotate it

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,839
because

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,360
the golden first times it wasn't clear

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,200
so for the doctors because also

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,480
another problem it was between the

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,600
doctors and then

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,400
with me the annotators it wasn't curious

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,039
they didn't have the agreement very well

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,280
about the

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,320
what is the best solutions for this and

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,559
also we want to use

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,400
some deep learning methods but anyway so

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:49,760
we when we did did i

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:53,520
reach the agreement so we used or added

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,320
this uh the keyboard of the medical

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,679
keyboard that

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,880
they won't be added in the old

00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,320
dictionary so the most uh

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,000
changed configuration it was for the

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,880
dictionary to

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,280
each time we add more data because we

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,559
have

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:11,360
we reached some some data that we had

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,640
in the guideline and after that we added

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,840
in the

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,840
in our dictionary files

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:28,000
okay so i have a question

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,480
uh ins and i don't know what the number

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,039
was for the slide but the one with uh

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,240
inner annotator agreement on batches two

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,240
through six i think it was

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,840
one it looked like one of the agreements

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:44,960
correct on batch number five

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:48,320
did that go down or is that uh

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,320
typo uh i have to check but uh i don't

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,080
remember exactly but i think uh maybe

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,760
it's typo

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,440
uh i have to check i don't remember

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,640
exactly but i don't see

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,120
it should be this so yeah i have to

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,840
check

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,960
i don't know okay i was just curious

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,360
yeah uh

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,799
i just noticed that one yeah i have to

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,840
check but that thing is typo

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,840
it should be 86 maybe yeah

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,120
and i have a comment and another i

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,480
suppose

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,120
begging question uh i would like to say

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,480
that those

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:27,760
first several slides on a clinical

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,240
text mining were probably the best i've

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,840
ever seen

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,320
and i was just wondering uh if you would

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,840
mind

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,440
people borrowing those of course yeah at

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,520
least

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,520
that's fantastic thank you very much

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,919
okay next question how long did it take

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,280
to annotate

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:57,360
a note on average ah

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,679
actually along a bit so every 10 days

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,480
we have the next bunch so for each month

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,760
so we have

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:07,120
every 10 hundred unique uh

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,600
reports so in every 10 days we have the

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,919
new

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,039
buying new branches but we usually it

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,799
takes a bit more because after 10 days

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,720
the annotation is it should be finished

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,600
and after that we start to evaluate the

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,159
result

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,919
to see how it was the the manual

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,240
annotations by analytics

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,159
because sometimes there was some error

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,480
by annotators

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,679
to save the s-man so we have to analyze

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,559
the result

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,039
and after that report then okay this new

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,600
uh

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:37,520
uh variables is the new so you added the

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,720
news we didn't we didn't have in the

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,520
ordinary

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,600
and some of them you change it so it

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,799
takes also five days to

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,559
uh review or evaluate this result and

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,679
after that so i think i can say

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:55,039
for each punch that it was 100 unique

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:57,600
reports it takes 20 days

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,840
less than 2015 days two weeks and you

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,520
have four annotators correct

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:05,679
uh we have four but uh we have shared

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,559
between two annotators here

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,799
right okay uh peter would like to know

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,799
what the qualifications were for your

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,080
annotators were they physicians

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,159
informaticists

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:20,400
uh so they are doctor and the nurse so

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,400
we have one doctor and three nurses

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,320
interesting so yeah i think it's

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,200
interesting that you were actually

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,280
changing your system based on what the

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,000
annotators were seeing

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,720
yes yeah so actually not changing but

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,120
improving

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,840
uh mostly their results so because you

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,880
know the most

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,080
challenge the most uh not challenging

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,320
but the most

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,480
uh change that we did it was in the

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,360
dictionary for first that we have it

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,240
because as i explained here uh let me

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,720
yeah it's here

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,440
so you can see in here is there all uh

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
faults

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,960
for the addition for the edition you

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,679
look up so sometimes

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,000
we have to add more variables as i said

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,159
because

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,360
i think the guideline for first time it

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,320
wasn't clear for the

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,440
the nurse and doctors or annotators to

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,400
know so

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,440
it takes a bit time to okay it is

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,400
correct or not

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,480
which information they want to add it

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:19,520
and so it takes a bit time to

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,520
improve these dictionary files

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,840
and also so of course in the middle of

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,679
the

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,760
this time also i improved the first

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,640
edition lookup especially for

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,000
uh these needs to find some better

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,120
pattern to find off

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,720
time to find them and also for the toy

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,080
board and miss spelling because i have

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,880
to change the accuracy

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,600
and also do some improvement for the

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,640
code

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,200
to uh detect the most uh variables with

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,240
the most

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,559
typo that is acceptable right

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,240
and that those changes are available in

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,120
your github repo right

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,080
uh the changes i think is not but i have

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,280
the first um

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,000
uh actually boss so for each branch i i

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,400
had the

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,200
uh the additional four for each find how

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,440
many

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,559
how what changed so i had it in the

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,360
github icon but

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,080
for the new push that i did i removed

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,880
them

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,919
but if i think it is necessary or is

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,200
good for the rest

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,760
i can't push it again just change it for

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,760
each punch

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,880
very good thank you um the reason not

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,760
no is not published yet uh so yeah but

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,240
we have planned to publish here

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,120
but if uh if you want i can put it in

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,159
the access

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:39,360
access somewhere and send the link in

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:41,760
the i don't know somewhere

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,320
and could you please repeat the number

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:47,919
of days it took for annotating documents

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:50,960
so uh for our first test it was 10 days

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,840
but yeah also after 10 days so we have

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,559
some

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,559
near one weeks to evaluate the reserved

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,320
annotators to find okay what is this

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,000
agreement and what is the problem of

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,480
another source as i said because

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,279
some especially for the first punches

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,279
and hotels

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,159
or this correct typo because it's

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,760
happiness

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,520
there are not a lot but anyway we have

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,640
to find them to have very clean

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,880
uh golden standard so also we spent five

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,799
days more for the

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,720
this is the response and each point we

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:32,559
have average 100

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:34,799
unit reports

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,799
sorry

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,600
it was a disney movie right this is the

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,640
mobize

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,159
at the end yeah sorry uh so yeah so the

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,840
average 20 days

00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,840
for 100 documents

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,360
wow

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:07,760
okay we've still got uh plenty of time

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,760
so are there any more questions

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,200
ah that's a good one yeah

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,559
i actually know so we have continued

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,520
this annotations part

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,080
so yeah of course we don't have yet but

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,200
we'll

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:32,000
continue these steps to have more

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,360
uh annotations part but the problem is

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,360
for the foundation

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,600
for the money to be able to give to

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,840
another dose but yeah we are

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,279
thinking about that but yeah we want to

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,240
have more data

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,400
to have to test it because at moment is

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:50,400
not enough

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:54,240
right did you have future direction

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,240
on one of your last slides

00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,360
maybe not maybe i'm imagining i just uh

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,799
i repeat

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,559
what was the main contributions

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,000
ah planning we are planning to use deep

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:10,240
learning approaches

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,360
okay yeah

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,760
okay yeah but we should have more uh uh

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,559
data but yeah actually as i said we are

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,279
continuing

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,320
the annotations parts to reach that

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,320
amount

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,200
so i think we have at the moment we have

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:28,400
uh 1000 more than four dozen but so we

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,400
have to have two dozen

00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,719
[Music]

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,880
yeah i think getting annotated notes is

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:53,840
a big problem

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:53,840
everywhere yeah exactly yeah

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:12,559
okay so maybe you said this but

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:15,600
how much overlap was there

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:18,559
for the same words

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,679
being in both the spanish and the

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:23,840
catalon

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:27,039
dictionary uh version is the overlap

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:29,279
so it means they have the same walls

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,279
right

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,120
i don't know exactly but they have the

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:40,159
the same but

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:42,559
another thing i don't remember exactly

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,799
how many overlap we have but we have

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,919
some uh catalan that we wanted tedec and

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,039
also in spanish

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,840
but mostly i don't know i don't remember

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,559
is actually

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,159
if i don't know martin and martha knows

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:58,240
in the group here

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,240
let me know but i don't remember exactly

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:04,880
okay thank you yeah i'm sorry

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,240
oh i was just curious yeah yeah so

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,080
mother since we don't have any

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,200
overlapping treatment there

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:14,480
oh wow yeah no

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,840
overlapping clinical terms

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,840
that's amazing

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,960
so as i so i will assume to explain

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,159
again for the deep learning part

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,640
so because the plan that we want to use

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,159
it

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,679
we don't want to use all of the

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,640
annotators

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,760
annotations for the deep learning part

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,799
we will try

00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:01,840
to see how it's going but the goal for

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:03,520
hormone is for some uh

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,200
variables that is very hard for the

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,919
rubber system to find the pattern for

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,279
them

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,679
we want to use the deep learning part to

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,880
see

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:17,039
if we can mix deep learning and do basis

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:27,360
together how is going to be and

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:28,880
many ways we need to have more data okay

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,720
i think that you've been reading the

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,640
chat am i correct in that yeah

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,640
so are you gonna use this

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,919
right let me so what except did you take

00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,919
towards

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,520
uh for the bad punctuation so

00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:59,279
uh so we use the

00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,520
tokenizer so mostly it takes all of them

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,520
uh

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:11,520
so as i explained in the previous uh

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:14,559
talk so the problem for us for example

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:17,120
for feelings if you have some uh

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,679
clinical tubers that for example the eye

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,799
that is

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:23,120
the lateralization

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,440
category that we want to take and also i

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,919
in this catalan is the end

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,360
so it was confusing with these two

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,720
informations

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,399
uh so we added some rules in our first

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,640
dictionary lookup

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,000
to handle this information and also we

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,640
applied the same

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,120
uh tokenizer for all of our components

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,840
as

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,559
such as the edition repository and also

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,679
for the

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,799
the rest that if we need it for example

00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,960
the expert checker

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,440
is not met so it solves the problem of

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,520
the

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,679
mixing of the punctuations and

00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:02,240
abbreviations work

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:05,120
and yeah

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,640
and also as martha mentions we have

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,799
another additional problem

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,399
that it was converting from the pdf to

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:13,760
text because the report was it

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:16,320
originally was in the pdf and during the

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,360
discovery uh conversion conver

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,559
converting to

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,880
takes we have also a problem for exactly

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,519
miss

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,559
spinning and the problem that is

00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,559
happening in the text

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:35,919
so also for the uh

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,399
using the system for the cares yeah so

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:41,519
we insert in the docker files

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:45,039
uh in the document and so

00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:50,159
the plan is to install

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:53,600
this docker in the hospital's

00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:56,159
computers and to use them

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,360
easily with this docker and also a

00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,559
micros plan

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,440
is developing at the broad version not

00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,080
that but a

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,720
web service version of the these tools

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,880
to

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,320
help them to doctors to select the

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,919
reports and after that

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:14,720
see the annotated files

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,919
and so yeah so it's the i also it's

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,440
available in the github

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:22,480
so you have the docker uh

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,000
image for each of them for each for

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,600
these tools

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,600
to use it in the real case and

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,760
because the problem was for the security

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,559
part the hospitals

00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,559
don't want to uh use the api and so on

00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,840
because of the security so we

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:43,440
create this uh image uh docker uh

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,679
files to insert in their computers and

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:57,840
they can easily

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:57,840
use it

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,279
okay so in terms of pdf detects

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,679
conversion

00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:08,720
what what problems did you have i'm just

00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,519
curious

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,919
so mostly if we have the table so we

00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,080
missed some information from the tables

00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,360
and another problem it was from this

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,360
some uh

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,960
in the converting we missed some

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,120
formations for example we

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,080
have the specs between the walls and so

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,760
on so we have more

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,760
typo there

00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,840
okay

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:49,120
uh from the truth for the pdf to text

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:51,760
uh something that uh

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,080
i think i um i don't know i didn't use

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:57,440
it because it was converting the text

00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:07,840
that i use but

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:07,840
if martin knows fish tools they did use

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,879
up yeah most also don't remember it but

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,800
also for the because also we have

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:29,280
another uh

00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,520
pdf fault as well because also we want

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,520
to

00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,639
training the model for the the paired at

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,879
the red one

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,480
for the spanish brat biomedical domain

00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:44,079
uh so we use the

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,800
uh the library for python for the pdf

00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,359
miner

00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,599
uh library that we we use for the

00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:52,480
converting from the pdf to text

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,159
so i think it was acceptable but yeah as

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,079
we have also some problem for

00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:03,839
this library as well especially for the

00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:03,839
tables and so on

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:16,720
okay so it's deca is from the pdf to

00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:21,200
text

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:24,560
yes perfect i haven't used it in

00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,800
quite a while and i think it um

00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,640
might still have problems with things

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:34,240
like tables

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,240
yeah yeah it it tries to identify them

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:41,280
based i think in large part uh on

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:45,280
caption but i can't remember i see

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:47,760
so i i remember also uh

00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,240
amazon also has the some service for the

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:54,240
pdf to takes that i heard is very good

00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,240
but i think is not for free

00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,839
but yeah it also has some tools

00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,320
let me check what was the name of amazon

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:09,440
tools

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:12,480
yeah text extracts i think

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:18,480
i will write it here

00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:18,480
maybe for the rest it seems also is

00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:28,720
yeah but that is not free

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,720
but i heard is very good

00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,320
okay so good so also i will

00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,839
test the tickle to see how he's going

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,320
for the spanish and catholic

00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,320
reports

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:55,839
okay we have a few minutes left

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,839
so hurry and get in those questions

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,400
uh for the bitter questions yeah also we

00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,720
have to some problem

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:34,320
first in our tools but not anymore so

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,880
because we have also some scene

00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,400
and so on for the indications and

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,520
complex sentence but

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:45,119
not too much but

00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,960
uh for for all uh words that we want to

00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:51,839
take no we didn't have

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,839
any challenge for that one

00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,839
that's a good question

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,400
uh yes of course yeah so we have the

00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,119
guideline

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,839
uh for the court how they have to do

00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,119
that

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:21,280
uh but yeah so for for reason for

00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:24,800
example if you see in the tables

00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:27,040
i didn't in the tables i didn't add the

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,079
first punch because for the first point

00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,760
it was most

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:35,280
test to it was 25

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:38,079
25 reports for all of the

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,560
same for all of the annotators and so

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,040
with the

00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,680
guideline that we prepared for them to

00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,839
test it

00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,880
and check the results of a reason i

00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:48,240
didn't add

00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,599
the first punch here because it was

00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,480
mostly the test

00:38:49,599 --> 00:39:01,839
for the guideline to be you know reached

00:38:52,480 --> 00:39:01,839
one agreement between another

00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,839
oh

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,920
nice comment

00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,720
yeah a lot yeah yeah

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:46,640
i love discussion video
