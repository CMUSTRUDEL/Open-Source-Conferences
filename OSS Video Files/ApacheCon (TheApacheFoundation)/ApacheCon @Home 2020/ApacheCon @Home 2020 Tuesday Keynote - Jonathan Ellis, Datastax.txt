Description: 
	DataStax Astra and Apache Cassandra: Sustainable Open Source in the Cloud Era

Jonathan Ellis, Co-founder and CTO, DataStax


Apache Cassandra solves database performance at scale better than any other system in the world, but it was designed for a world of self-managed infrastructure. This created a lot of rough edges for the level of automation DataStax needed to build its Astra managed service for Cassandra. Building Astra also exposed some gaps in Cassandra’s feature set that modern developers want and expect from a database-as-a-service.


DataStax believes that developers and businesses shouldn’t have to give up ownership of their data to take advantage of the benefits of cloud infrastructure. We want everyone to have the freedom to deploy anywhere, without lock-in. This talk will explain how we’re bringing the enhancements we made for Astra back to Apache Cassandra. Following the Cassandra Enhancement Proposal process, we are showing that cloud and open source are not mutually exclusive.


Jonathan Ellis is a co-founder of DataStax. Before DataStax, Jonathan was Project Chair of Apache Cassandra for six years, where he built the Cassandra project and community into an open-source success. Previously, Jonathan built an object storage system based on Reed-Solomon encoding for data backup provider Mozy that scaled to petabytes of data and gigabits per second throughput.
