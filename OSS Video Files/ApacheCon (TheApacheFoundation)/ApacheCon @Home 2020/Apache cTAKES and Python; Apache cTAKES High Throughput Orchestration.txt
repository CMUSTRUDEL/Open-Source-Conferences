	Apache cTAKES and Python; Apache cTAKES High Throughput Orchestration

1. The rise of Natural Language Processing Machine Learning libraries in Python has created opportunities for the Apache clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES). There are also challenges in utilizing the Java-based cTAKES type system across platforms.

2. We have built a high throughput orchestration mechanism to process and publish millions of redacted and unredacted notes in a PHI-safe environment and to manage refreshes where notes can continually be re-redacted, or obsoleted. We have a high-urgency stream of Covid related notes that are on a weekly refresh basis.

Dmitriy Dligach:
The overarching goal of Dr. Dligach's research is developing methods for automatic semantic analysis of texts. His work spans such areas of computer science as natural language processing, machine learning, and data mining. Most recently his research has focused on semantic analysis of clinical texts. He works both on method development and applications.

Sean Finan:
Sean Finan is a software developer in the Natural Language Processing lab at Boston Children's Hospital. He has worked with Apache cTAKES for the past 8 years, contributing code and supporting the community.
Peter Abramowitsch: Peter Abramowitsch started using cTAKES while working in the Hearst Health Innovation Lab. He is now an Architect and cTAKES Implementer in Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute at the University of California, San Francisco.
