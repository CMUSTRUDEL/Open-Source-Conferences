Oak Ridge National Labs


High Performance Computing with Apache Spark and Parquet on Mission Critical Tasks


Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is known for its deployment of some of the world's fastest supercomputers. This legacy brings us opportunities to work on some of the most challenging societal problems. Often, these problems require approaches that are more comprehensive than what specific high-performance computing solutions can solve. In this talk, we will talk about the essential role that Apache Spark and Parquet played in solving some of these problems. We will illustrate Apache Spark and Parquet's uses with a case study related to suicide and overdose risk where prevention. The result is a 300x speedup in processing from 75+ hours for the original algorithm to 15 minutes with a new one. We will discuss specific techniques behind this accomplishment and the lessons learned.


Edmon Begoli, PhD works at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), where he leads research and development programs aimed at scaling and improving the resilience of critical decision making.


Edmon is a committer with Apache Software Foundation, and is a joint faculty professor of Computer Science at the University of Tennessee, EECS department.
