	Apache Royale - starting from a blank file

This is how-to-do-it session for people who have not worked with Apache Royale, and do not have experience in the Adobe/Apache Flex ecosystem. Focusing on a model to-do list application using an MVC structure, the session steps through setting up Royale, getting the first files compiled and running, and what goes into making a robust, extensible application that can run on any major browser or as an app on a mobile device.

Andrew worked in and led documentation and QA teams in projects ranging from startups to groups in major corporations for 15 years. He is the main editor for the Apache Royale project.

Carlos Rovira:
Creator of the Jewel component set for Apache Royale. Author of many tutorials and blog entries on different aspects of Royale.
