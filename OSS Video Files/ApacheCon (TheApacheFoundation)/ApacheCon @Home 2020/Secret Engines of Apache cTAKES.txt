The Apache clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) default pipeline is a standard in the natural language processing clinical research community. What is past that standard? While the default clinical pipeline uses almost 20 analysis engines, there are dozens more in various cTAKES modules. We present and discuss the top 5 annotation engines you never knew you had.

Sean Finan is a software developer in the Natural Language Processing lab at Boston Children's Hospital. He has worked with Apache cTAKES for the past 8 years, contributing code and supporting the community.
