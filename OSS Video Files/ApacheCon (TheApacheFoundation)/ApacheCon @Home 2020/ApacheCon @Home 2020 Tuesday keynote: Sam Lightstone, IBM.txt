Description: 
	Double inflection point: Open Source meets AI
Sam Lightstone: Chief Technology Officer for AI Strategy, IBM


Abstract: Machine Learning is almost as old as the electronic computer, but the domain has experienced a massive infusion of energy and investment over the past 8 years. During this time the open source community has simultaneously developed a wide landscape of rich, sophisticated OSS packages for machine learning and deep learning such as Apache Marvin-AI, DLlab, Spark, MLlib, MADlib and OpenNLP. In this talk IBM CTO for AI Strategy, Sam Lightstone, will explore the confluence of these two disruptions and the possibilities that lie ahead for dramatic advances in AI, computation power, distributed computing, and a sea-change in computer science.
