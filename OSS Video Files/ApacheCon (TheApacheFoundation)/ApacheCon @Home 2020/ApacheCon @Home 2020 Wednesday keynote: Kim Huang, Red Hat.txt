Description: 
	Rethinking Language: Why Now, Whatâ€™s Next

Kim Huang, Content Strategist, Red Hat


At the core of open source is the idea that we continually change and adapt as we learn new information or discover better ways of doing things. We welcome ideas from anyone to help us make the best software available. Adapting the language we use in our code to become more welcoming for all current and future community members is part of that ethos. Learn about why Red Hat is taking steps to rethink the language of our code and documentation, and the impact this work will have.

spending some time with me today so

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,400
today we're going to talk about

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,000
words and the importance of words

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,880
because words are important to me i'm

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,439
full disclosure

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,320
i am not a developer i am not a

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,320
programmer

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,360
i'm a person who works with words every

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,920
day and i

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,400
i try to explore what they mean and

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,159
where they come from all the time so

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,079
i won't take up too much of your time

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,079
today with my talk so let's just go

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,200
ahead and get started

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,640
i want to start off with a story this

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,000
happened to me a few months ago

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,880
a colleague of mine came to me and

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,479
told me about my use of the word

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,719
grandfathering

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,560
um for those of you who don't know where

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,119
the word came from

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,399
the original meaning of the word

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,560
grandfathering came from something

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,239
called a grandfather clause which

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,000
in the southeastern part of the u.s

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,080
which is where i'm from

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,360
was something that was used to suppress

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,520
voting rights

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,120
it was said that if your grandfather had

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,280
the right to vote

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,160
then you automatically were eligible for

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,200
voting

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,200
at a time where most black people were

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,280
the descendants of enslaved persons

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,480
so if your grandfather was a person who

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,840
was enslaved

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,879
they obviously did not have the right to

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,879
vote and therefore you didn't either

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,000
it's a very problematic and very awful

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,599
history

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,920
and i was really shocked to hear about

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,760
it it actually had

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,760
a personal connection obviously to me

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,720
i'm a black woman i'm from virginia

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,280
which has

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,080
its own version or had rather its own

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,640
version of this

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:58,879
rule so my first reaction

00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:02,720
was wow why didn't i know that

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,319
am i stupid like it's my history

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,200
it's something that happened where i'm

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,400
from i probably have family members

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,920
who are affected by this rule why didn't

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,800
i know this before

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,879
so i was kind of automatically put on

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,400
the defensive

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:23,519
the second reaction i had was okay

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,920
i'm not a bad person right is the person

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,760
that

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,280
told me this is the person that came to

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,200
me with this feedback are they trying to

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,239
tell me that i'm bad

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,519
are they telling me that i'm ignorant

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,879
or that i'm hurtful towards others

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,959
so i had that reaction and i started

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,360
creating a story in my own head

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,560
about what it meant when this person

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,080
came to me with this feedback

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,400
my next reaction was no harm meant so

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,120
no harm done hey i've been using this

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,319
word in

00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:00,959
countless emails conversations

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:03,439
messages presentations even

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,080
there was no harm intended i didn't mean

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,799
it by its

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,760
older meaning i meant it by its modern

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,159
day meeting which

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,599
you know we all say grandfather someone

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,120
into a system for example

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:18,000
grandfather a user for example

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,799
so i felt like i hadn't committed any

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,759
harm

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,639
and that it wasn't worth the

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,960
conversation at all

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:29,040
and finally i said okay so what now

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,360
if i don't use that word anymore i have

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,280
to find an alternative right

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,040
how do i go about doing that how do i

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,199
find an alternative that other people

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,360
will automatically understand

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,639
how will i find another way to say this

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,840
should i do that

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,880
is it worth having the conversation

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,080
in the end i decided that yes it is

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,759
worth it

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,400
and the reason why is that

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,840
language was never meant to be static

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,840
and technology isn't either

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,000
the conversation about inclusive

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,960
language

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,800
is not new it's not something that just

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,240
started a few weeks ago or even a few

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,440
months ago

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,280
it's something that's been happening for

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,800
decades

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:19,360
python made changes to its code and

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,520
the response was tepid to say the least

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,240
i submit for consideration this quote

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,240
from the cathedral on the bazaar it says

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,880
good programmers know what to write

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,320
and great ones know what to rewrite and

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,919
reuse

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,759
i don't have to agree with everything

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,400
that eric raymond has said or written in

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,039
the past

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,440
but i do agree with this especially the

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,600
word rewrite

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,800
sometimes relationships between elements

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,240
and code

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,080
is not really well defined by the words

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,759
that we choose to use there

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,000
but developers learn this word and

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:56,160
programmers learn this word so

00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
that's what they use no harm intended so

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,000
no harm done right

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,039
imagine you are a person who speaks

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,080
english as their second language

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,680
and you're trying to learn this

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,880
terminology for the first time you're

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,680
getting into

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,880
using open source code and trying to you

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,039
know dip your toe into

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:20,240
programming are these terms harmful

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:23,840
or offensive to you maybe not

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,960
maybe do they make the threshold of

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,840
learning higher

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,240
for you because of their lack of clarity

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,880
possibly

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,680
the words that we choose should be more

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,120
clear

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,880
more consistent with meaning and

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,319
not make the threshold higher for people

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,319
trying to enter open source

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,880
so what now and more importantly

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,280
why now a lot of people have thoughts

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,280
about this

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,960
a lot of people think that it's

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,360
performative and i'll

00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,199
get to that in a second basically

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,960
my thoughts are when you find new

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,199
information you change

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,400
open source was never meant to be

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,160
something that was

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,919
closed off or unchanging

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,759
so why should the language that we use

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,520
never change

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,880
if we have new information and new

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,360
feedback

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,319
we can change things to be more clear

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,039
and better serve

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,039
both user and programmer

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,720
change upon the discovery of new

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,560
information is a natural part

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:44,319
of progress and creativity therefore

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:45,919
it's inherent to open source so i want

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,440
to backtrack for a bit

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,240
i talk about grandfathering one more

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,240
time so

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,400
my initial reactions were thinking that

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,160
this person wanted me to

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,720
clean up my language you know they

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,879
wanted me to be more politically correct

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,960
uh they wanted me to be performative or

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,440
they wanted to censor me in some way

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,120
but censorship is not the same as

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,360
rethinking the origins

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,280
and the utility of the language that we

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,440
choose to use

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,360
and most people use the word politically

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,680
correct or the term rather

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,720
when they want a conversation to end and

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,319
not when they want

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,319
ideas to be shared and heard

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,800
so i talked about being performative

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,320
i'll talk about what's in it for you

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,159
first off

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:39,120
imagine that you are at a gym

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,159
i know that's kind of hard to talk about

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,360
right now or

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,399
or describe or think about but

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,839
bear with me it's a good renai for

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,920
what's the first thing that you do when

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,000
you go to a gym

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,040
you get water you put your stuff in a

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,800
locker

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,200
you go to wherever you're going to work

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,680
out whether it's a studio or

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,880
you know machines and you stretch out a

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,760
little bit

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,120
now stretching can look benign it can

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,320
also look a little silly

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,800
sometimes it can look kind of innocuous

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,399
but we stretch for a reason and it isn't

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,720
because it looks good

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,519
we stretch so that we can perform at our

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,760
best

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:22,160
and that's what this is this isn't the

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,720
entire race or the entire workout this

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,000
is just the warm up

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,399
making changes like this is just one of

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,720
many

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,120
actions that people can take to make

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,279
open source more inclusive

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:40,320
think of it as improv style yes and

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:44,320
yes we can make changes to our code

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:47,680
and we can also take more steps

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,800
to address inequity so

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:54,480
what's in it for you well

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,880
i can't necessarily speak to

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,560
what's in it for an individual i know

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,600
for myself

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,240
that i work at red hat and i do what i

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,959
do

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,560
because i want everyone regardless of

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,959
wherever they came from

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,760
or whatever nation they're from whatever

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,600
their creed

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,519
whatever their religion whatever their

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,120
beliefs to have

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,320
a place in open source and to feel like

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,920
they can participate

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,440
in technology that's what i do that's

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,519
why i do what i do

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,040
so i can't answer it for you as an

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,079
individual

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,279
but we live in a world

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:36,880
where there are systems events

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:39,920
like covid things that seem kind of

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,320
out of our control and impossible to

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,320
shift

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,640
in a world with so many things that we

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,880
can't control

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,880
this is one thing that we can control

00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:01,839
so why not make an effort to do so

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,440
this is just one action that red hat is

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,760
taking as part of a larger commitment to

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,040
address inequity

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:16,079
red hat will be an advocate for change

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,120
will contribute when needed and also it

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,040
will support

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,600
those who want to participate in the

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,600
initiative

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,160
and like i said before this isn't the

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,040
closing act

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,320
this isn't the entire exercise this is

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,920
just the warm-up

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,920
this is just the beginning

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,680
so that's it

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,360
this is my first keynote i don't really

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,480
have that much to say

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,279
and i've already gotten through it so

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,160
i want to thank apachecon for having me

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,680
today

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,000
i want to thank sam knuth who is driving

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,839
this presentation uh we're doing a

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,920
social distancing thing obviously you

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,200
know we can't be in contact so it means

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,040
a lot to me

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,680
that he was able to support me in this

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,320
way so thank you thank you sam hi sam

presentation and it's so important that

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,720
we are

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,560
conscious about our language choices and

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:39,839
how they affect people

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,839
