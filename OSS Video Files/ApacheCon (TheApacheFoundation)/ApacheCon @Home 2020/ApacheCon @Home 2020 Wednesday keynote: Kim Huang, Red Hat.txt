Description: 
	Rethinking Language: Why Now, Whatâ€™s Next

Kim Huang, Content Strategist, Red Hat


At the core of open source is the idea that we continually change and adapt as we learn new information or discover better ways of doing things. We welcome ideas from anyone to help us make the best software available. Adapting the language we use in our code to become more welcoming for all current and future community members is part of that ethos. Learn about why Red Hat is taking steps to rethink the language of our code and documentation, and the impact this work will have.
