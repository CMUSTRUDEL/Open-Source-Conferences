	XML to JSON to RDF : Another iteration in data format evolution
Claude Warren

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

Starting with a brief history of web and micro server data serialization formats, this talk looks at the advantages of using RDF as the data format for web and micros service processing. An example of the processing as performed in a live application is presented. The talk demonstrates how RDF processed by Jena can deliver a clean, extensible data format with simple merge characteristics and mechanisms for reasoning.
