Built using Apache UIMA, Apache clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) is a modular and extensible tool for Natural Language Processing. This is a quick start tutorial on adding custom elements to cTAKES. We illustrate creating simple classes to input, process and output data. This involves a concise overview of Apache uimaFIT and the cTAKES type system, as well as building a UIMA pipeline using piper files.

Sean Finan is a software developer in the Natural Language Processing lab at Boston Children's Hospital. He has worked with Apache cTAKES for the past 8 years, contributing code and supporting the community.
