Apache cTAKESâ„¢ is a natural language processing system for the extraction of information from electronic medical record clinical free-text. It's predominantly a desktop-based application. This session will talk about enabling REST support in cTAKES. We will be setting up UMLS knowledge sources in MySQL DB using scripts generated by cTAKES Dictionary Creator GUI which in turn uses MetamorphoSys UMLS installation wizard. We will deploy the cTAKES web REST module in tomcat and the application will use the cTAKES engine to perform analysis of the payload passed via REST call against the MySQL DB source and returns the analysis findings as JSON. We will also have a quick demo of the steps mentioned above. This will help healthcare industry to perform NLP analysis using cTAKES engine with just a REST endpoint.
