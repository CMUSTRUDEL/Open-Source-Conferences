Many of the Apache projects serving the big data space do not come with out of the box support for geospatial data types like points, lines, and polygons. LocationTech GeoMesa has provided add-on support to Apache database projects such as Accumulo, Cassandra, HBase, and Redis crafting spatial and spatio-temporal keys. In addition to distributed databases, GeoMesa has enables spatial storage in many of the popular Apache file format projects such as Arrow, Avro, Orc, and Parquet. This talk will review the basics of big geo data persistence either in a data lake or in a database, and provide an overview of the benefits (and limitations) of each technology.

Jim Hughes applies training in mathematics and computer science to build distributed, scalable system capable of supporting data science and machine learning. He is a core committer for GeoMesa, which leverages HBase, Accumulo and other distributed database systems to provide distributed computation and query capabilities. He is also a committer for the LocationTech projects JTS and SFCurve and serves a mentor for other LocationTech and Eclipse projects. He serves on the LocationTech Project Management Committee and Steering Committee. Through work with LocationTech and OSGeo projects like GeoTools and GeoServer, he works to build end-to-end solutions for big spatio-temporal problems. Jim received his Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Virginia for work studying algebraic topology. He enjoys playing outdoors and swing dancing.
