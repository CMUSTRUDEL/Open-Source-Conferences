	Apache Geospatial: Open Source and Open Standards
George Percivall

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

The Apache Geospatial Track provides the latest in applying Apache Projects to geospatial data and processing. Beginning in 2016, the geospatial track has provided a venue for geospatial applications using open source from Apache and other open source foundations. The Geospatial Track includes a focus on the use of open standards to enable interoperability and code reuse between independent software developments. The Geospatial Track for ApacheCon 2020 will include projects from Apache Software Foundation as well as from LocationTech Technology ( http://locationtech.org) and the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (https://www.osgeo.org/). Open standards will be included from the Open Geospatial Consortium (http://www.ogc.org/). Open standards enables reuse of common elements for geospatial information and processing resulting in increased productivity, lower interoperability friction, and higher data quality. Standards for Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs), spatial geometries and data arrays used for projects with geospatial content will be described based on open source projects and open standards. Emphasis is placed on the use of open standards including the emerging baseline of OGC APIs. OGC APIs are being defined for geospatial resources, e.g., maps, tiles, features, coverages. Developed using OpenAPI, the APIs can be implemented in a number of languages and patterns. The presentation will be describe the state of implementations and plans for standardization. The modular structure enables flexibility for developers to reuse OGC APIs in their APIs. If open source for geospatial is of interest to you, join the discussion on geospatial@apache.org.

[Music]

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,920
i think so yeah

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:32,160
great um so as a brief introduction uh

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,280
george and i are your

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,680
track uh co-chairs uh georgia speaking

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,480
first

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,879
about apache geospatial uh all about

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,800
open source and open standards so

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:47,280
uh please take it away george

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,480
thank you jim it's really been good to

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,160
uh work with you

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,079
and all of the folks have submitted

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,160
abstracts to get to this point

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,719
we have today and tomorrow um a track

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,000
around apache apachecon geospatial um

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,479
this is a community

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
that uh has been active since 2016.

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,159
we had a really good session back in

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,360
vancouver at what was then called apache

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,400
big data

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,000
and uh a boss and a mailing list came

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,640
out of that

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,200
discussion and we've held geospatial

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,759
tracks

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,720
since then there is that mailing list as

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,759
you see below

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,600
as well to stimulate discussion about

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,080
geospatial topics that are in common

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,600
across

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,799
apache projects so encourage you to

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,079
join and be involved and

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,400
contribute today

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,079
this is the first set of presentations

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,560
for today so i'll give a

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,439
opening discussion here about open

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,439
source

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,360
and open standards you'll see my

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,200
backgrounds and open standards

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,720
but it also relates to a lot of what

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,240
goes on in open source and i'll try to

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,759
make that case

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,600
a veteran uh martin desaro with sis

00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:03,759
uh tom carlitas and francesco

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,759
uh giving us uh some api discussions uh

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,319
james jim coming back and talking about

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,360
geo mesa he talked last year and so he's

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,959
a veteran as well

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,520
lucian a buddy of mine from way back in

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,560
nasa days uh it's good to see lucian on

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,640
the agenda

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,400
and we'll finish up today with liz mapp

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,000
to create web map applications really

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,720
looking forward to

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,959
renee luke presentation to finish off

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,480
the discussion today each of them are

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:33,599
uh 50 minutes long tomorrow

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,120
a little bit more on analytic side

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:40,720
and so spark uh lunga

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,080
auto retrain using airflow and nifi

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,480
geospark also has a different name now

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,360
uh so gia and muhammad we'll speak about

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,640
that

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,680
and then into deep learning on earth

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,239
observations

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,560
satellite drone imagery and massively

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,440
scalable geospatial anomaly detection

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,560
with kafka

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,000
and cassandra paul coming from australia

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,120
at some oh god dark

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,959
hour in the morning for him so uh

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,640
we really appreciate everyone's

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,640
contributions

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:15,519
for the track over today and tomorrow

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,480
so that's what you'll see um so let me

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,840
dive in on my

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,440
portion of the presentations then

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,360
and so what i'll speak to you a little

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,000
bit about today in the next

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,760
45 minutes is open source and open

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,840
standards

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,319
and i come from a perspective which is

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,120
the open geospatial consortium

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,200
we are a consortium of organizations 500

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,400
organizations from industry government

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,959
research

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,280
and academic so essentially a third in

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,319
each of those kind of domains a third

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,360
from europe a third from north america

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,159
and a third from

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,480
the rest of the globe so really are a um

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,239
a consortium global consortium and

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,000
you know uh the domains government

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,319
research and industry

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,680
and our role in the world is to provide

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,319
some thought leadership and innovation

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,560
around

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,840
all things related to location we began

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,920
with gis

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,879
my background to mode sensing i wouldn't

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,319
join the staff

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,080
until they changed it to the open

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,200
geospatial consortium

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,519
uh so and you know now we even think a

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,160
little bit broader than just geospatial

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,880
uh we think about location uh we're a

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,280
trusted

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,680
neutral forum for attacking tackling

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,160
interoperability issues that's our

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,000
key mantra is interoperability so you'll

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,160
see a lot of focus on apis

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,360
and encodings and the knowledge

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,400
associated with

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,400
geospatial information trying to

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,440
gather that knowledge codify it in

00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,080
specifications

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,320
and see it implemented in code and feed

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,840
that back into the specifications

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,160
so um i think i've mentioned this with

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,040
respect to the

00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:56,880
organizations uh the cross-cutting

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,520
different domains uh the members of ogc

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,680
so okay that's a little bit about ogc

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,639
let me speak about open standards

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,639
and open source um there's also open

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,080
data which is very key but today only be

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,639
talking about open standards and open

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,680
source

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,120
and the compatibility and the the value

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,160
of working those together

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,560
so in particular uh the value

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,240
is increased code quality right so the

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,280
ability to write code

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,560
that builds upon people

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,840
and projects and knowledge from before

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,520
the time you started writing this

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,039
immediate project right so how to

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,080
improve that code quality based upon

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,000
that knowledge

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,160
reducing development effort because if

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,080
your apis match somebody else's apis you

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,720
have to write all the glute code right

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,039
stable and proven apis and encodings for

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,080
interoperability so that quality of

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,360
getting the data sharing data exchange

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,759
um is key through apis and encoding and

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,960
then

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,960
interchangeability of software

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,600
components you know you're able to much

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,080
more

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,039
much more easily how about that uh it's

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,160
easier to

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:03,039
uh you know reuse code

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,560
uh when it's designed with a common

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,520
understanding of what the

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,520
elements of that code are about um you

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,080
know i'd like to draw on an esteemed

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,199
colleague today uh rich bowen you know

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,840
what a hero man

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,759
putting this together in terms of uh

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,759
covet and virtual but he's also a leader

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,319
with respect to um

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,919
open standards and open source he serves

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,319
on the board of oasis

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:29,120
as well as of course here in apache uh

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,639
and i pick up a twitter uh tweet that he

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,720
said the other day open standards are

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,479
awesome but without open source to

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,199
implement those standards that wouldn't

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,720
truly which wouldn't be truly open uh

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,360
completely agree with that

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,800
we need a mix of open standards and open

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,120
source in order for that

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,520
ecosystem of knowledge and

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,720
implementation to move forward

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,440
the oasis open project has a really good

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,360
statement with respect to that that the

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,720
world is full of open source code that

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,800
doesn't interoperate

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,800
in standards that don't get implemented

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,639
working together on code and standards

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,840
is the best path to adoption

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,000
so hopefully you see uh at least some

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,759
i've given you the themes of what we're

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,080
talking about with respect to uh

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,440
that implementation uh but what is a

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,599
standard i've mentioned a little bit of

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,000
this already distilled wisdom of people

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,680
that have

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,919
worked on the topics that have come

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,080
before you and have worked through

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,639
issues that are very key

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,599
and that standards are that knowledge is

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,639
powerful

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:31,919
for use one other distinction to make

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,680
is open versus public you will see a lot

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,120
of apis that are published on the web

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,400
and declared

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,360
open it would fail our test of uh

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,639
open consensus certainly those apis are

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,000
public they're viewable they're

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,039
invokable but the process

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,840
to control the api may be proprietary

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,639
may not be open it may be controlled by

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,240
you know a

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,240
a single entity whereas

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,440
when you really want to speak about open

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,280
and open standards you want to talk

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,199
about open consensus

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,960
driven by a consensus process that

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,520
anyone can participate and have a

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,440
control

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,280
in so that's what we do at ogc for

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,919
geospatial standards

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,000
we have a suite of standards if you will

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,680
in the areas of abstract specifications

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,479
that define the topics

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,840
give meaning and definitions and object

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,160
diagrams and

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,639
uh abstract definition to what it means

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,479
to have geospatial information

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,039
we have a set of implementation

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,919
standards uh that take those abstract

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,160
standards or

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,399
push the abstract standards and are

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,800
implementable right you can verify

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,240
that your code meets these uh set of

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,760
standards we also have a new category

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,919
called community standards

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,519
where things that are developed might be

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,720
public but not open

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,480
over time become become open through a

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,519
process of the community standard

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,080
process so

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,760
some good stuff happening there so what

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,560
kind of standards do we have

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,080
uh and so there's a bit of an agenda for

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,279
the remainder of the talk

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,839
uh to give some um discussion about uh

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,680
topics uh standards topics that can be

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,279
reused when you're writing code so

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,839
coordinate reference systems

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,440
uh are key to spatial geospatial

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,080
geometry so how to

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,519
have defined geometries how to have

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,959
geometric relations

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,640
defined in a consistent way encodings

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,720
that match your target audience and are

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,200
reusable have libraries associated with

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,399
them

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,760
apis of course linking resources

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,279
together the web of data

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,680
and then analytics what does it mean to

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,600
have meaningful patterns in spatial data

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,360
and how might those happen these are

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,680
actually from a best practice that we

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,959
have developed jointly with w3c and you

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,120
can see that on the web

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,880
so let's dive into some of these topics

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,560
spatial referencing both in terms of

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,959
coordinate reference systems and

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,480
discrete global grid systems

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,640
so different ways i'm not going to treat

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,519
position and location as much but

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,800
crss that use coordinates and dggs that

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,440
use cells

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,800
um so in the beginning everyone agreed

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,959
the world was flat right

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,880
uh it was all simple we had 2d map

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,000
projections we had maps right we had

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,760
paper maps

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,040
and everything was fine because it was

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,920
flat until you fell off the edge of

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,560
there right well

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,560
you know even 2d maps weren't perfect

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,880
you're distorting the surface

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:17,920
of a sphere an ellipsoid and you get

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,519
errors you get distortions associated

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,320
with that you have to make choices about

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,240
area

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,839
and lines and directions and the like

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,600
there's no perfect choice

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,600
uh but you know we had to print maps in

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,640
2d we had to write maps out on paper the

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,440
whole bit

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,160
um so you know that's one thing we deal

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,240
with um

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,760
there's ways to get beyond that the

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,440
other thing that's a little bit uh

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,040
surprising to people who haven't dialed

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,160
into this a little bit is that

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,160
you know you hear about well there's

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,160
just latitude longitude right so

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,000
let's just use that we're done right

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,920
well it turns out that latitude and

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,200
longitude are not unique when you say

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,519
latitude and longitude there is

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,640
ambiguity associated by that

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,560
because the shape of the earth is

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,480
so there's different definitions it may

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,320
be treated as a sphere

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,920
it may be treated as a flattened

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,800
ellipsoid the

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,959
size of it the location all determine

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,600
where that latitude is at of that person

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,360
on the

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,880
surface of the earth and if you have a

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,000
different model of what's called the

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,399
geodetic datum

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,079
you end up with a different latitude for

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,160
the same location on the earth so

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,959
latitude is not unique

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,640
those measurements are not the same even

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,519
wgs 84

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,240
which is a really gay great geostatic

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,120
datum

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,079
is actually a family of geodetic datums

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,519
that change

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,399
over time um so you know the continents

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,480
move

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,800
uh you can attach a map to a continent

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,279
you can anchor it on australia

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,000
but if you're using wgs 84 your

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,399
coordinates

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,640
move with time is it significant well

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,440
it's on the order of you know a meter

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,200
1.8 meters over a decade or a couple of

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,200
decades there's known distortions

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,440
there's way to deal with these things

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,760
but they're significant um it's things

00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,000
that relate in misaligned maps and

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,959
places out of locations that we need to

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,160
worry about

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,279
um based upon the the surface of the

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,880
earth changing

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:11,360
and the wgs 84 moving with that and uh

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,880
so you know depends upon your accuracy

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,839
if you're worried about people crossing

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,480
the street and

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,880
you know automated vehicles and the like

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,279
uh

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,720
1.8 meters is highly significant over

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,079
time right so there's millions of

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,560
dollars that have been lost

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,120
in construction projects because of this

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,120
um

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,880
and so we're adjusting to that right

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,760
we've got new coordinate reference

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,760
standards

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,000
uh so some of you may be familiar with

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,639
the ogc

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,079
well-known text or coordinate reference

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,480
systems and the abstract

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,360
spec that goes along with that uh those

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,760
have been revised as of 2019

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,560
uh so for example you know well-known

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,079
text 2

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,480
and crs and these allow for definitions

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,120
that deal with those dynamic datums as

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,519
well as

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,639
have fixed some errors in the previous

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,399
well-known text

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,040
definition so you want to be moving

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:04,320
towards well-known text version

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,760
2 the crs well-known text version 2 and

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,560
the document that's freely available

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,000
there

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,680
from ogc you know

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
this is what you get with a well-known

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,519
text this is for a dynamic crs ellipsoid

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,839
with a 3d coordinate system

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,880
so it's you know the text associated

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,079
with that

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,880
so uh well-known text for crs one way to

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,399
deal with location another exciting way

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,160
to deal with locations is

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,440
hey why don't we treat the world as if

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,440
it was 3d

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,200
and define a grid on the surface of the

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,639
earth with some really nice properties

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,720
of those grids

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,600
so there's been a great research of this

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,720
for you know 30 more years

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,399
and it's been now formalized into an

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,240
open standard

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,279
called discrete global grid systems from

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,279
ogc and it is a spatial reference system

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:54,480
that uses a hierarchical tessellation of

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,720
cells to partition and address the globe

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,279
so there is uh the d2gs standard from

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,480
ogc defines the attributes associated

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,560
with the dggs

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,000
of which there are many choices you can

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,519
choose cell geometries

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,440
you can choose different ways in which

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,240
the tessellation of the cells

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,920
in a hierarchy go together but we're

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,000
getting some order to these we're

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,199
getting some discussion about

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,040
how they're similar and how they're

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,360
different and that allows you to make

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,560
choices then about which dggs

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,639
to use for your application um so

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,760
you know it's about choosing cells and

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,480
it's about choosing

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,000
indices or an index on that cell beware

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,040
there's some patents associated

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,040
with some of this work

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,240
okay so that's crs that's finding your

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,160
place on the globe

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,399
but now you want to describe things in

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,480
geometry and spatial relations

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,399
so there is what's been defined for a

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,040
while now called simple features

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,680
this is the geometries that are simple

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,600
uh points curves polygons line strings

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,120
and collections of geometries and so the

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,800
definition these are

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,480
readily available lots of software

00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,839
implemented stuff there's compliance

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,760
tests that are available

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,519
you know these things are are well

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,800
defined um

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,639
and there's also in that same

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,560
specification a set of what are called

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,360
spatial relations or topological

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,920
relations

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,680
between spatial objects and this too has

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,800
a good history both in terms of

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,959
implementation

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,560
the specification and the mathematics

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,519
the topological mathematics that went

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,720
behind

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:25,120
defining these eight relationships uh

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,320
you know i thought this was settled and

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,680
then last week

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,279
on the geospatial um um mailing list

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,839
that i mentioned earlier a discussion

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:36,560
came up about contains in particular

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,279
and uh it was interesting to see that

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,639
discussion

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,480
and so um tune into the geospatial but

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,440
it's all good you can use exactly what's

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,519
in front of you

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:50,880
and contains is a good thing to use

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,560
space and time so not just 2d or 3d

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,240
space but looking at time

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,160
and trajectories through space and time

00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,680
this is the abstract specification

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,759
that's defined for

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,160
moving features so things that move

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,040
through spatial planes over time

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,000
good semantics associated with this good

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,000
encodings now

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,839
associated with it in several different

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,440
uh it's well-known text uh

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,600
it's in json and it's in something else

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,880
um but it defines then these kind of

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,680
relationships right

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,160
um for trajectories in a geometry how

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,720
when

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,600
did this trajectory pass through this

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,600
geometry

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,519
the semantics are asking that question

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,880
just like the spatial relationship i

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,600
showed earlier

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,160
uh similarly you can ask a question like

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,880
when

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,000
and where were two trajectories at a

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,480
minimum difference

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,279
their nearest approach and so these are

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,199
really key

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,279
um and people are doing some really good

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,440
software and we need to um

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:50,240
be consistent about our definition so we

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,920
can be we can compare

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,800
our semantics about trajectories and the

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,320
queries about trajectories

00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,040
encodings and visualizations

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,279
so geojson great format for encoding a

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,559
variety of geographic data structures

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:08,880
it's a json5 written in json

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,679
uh can encode a region of space that is

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,400
a geometry

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,319
it can encode a spatially bounded entity

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,640
a feature that has geometries and

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,520
attributes or it can be a collection of

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,319
features

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,640
and you see the types of geometries it

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:26,799
supports points line strength polygons

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,880
the list there it uses wgs 84

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,919
and units of decimal degrees and you can

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,039
find that spec

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:36,080
at that link at ietf uh

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:40,240
geopackage an ogc standard defined in

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:43,679
sqlite and so encodes a boatload of

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,320
geospatial information using a sequel

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,440
light

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:50,799
structure uh for tiles

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,799
raster maps feature data geometry data

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,799
a variety of things really great for

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,840
deployed operations if you will it's a

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,840
package right

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,000
you take it and you go and you can

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,200
really uh use it directly as a single

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,960
single file geotiff

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,480
one of the things that's been around for

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,520
a long time coming out of the remote

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,400
sensing society

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,360
remote sensing community and uh written

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,080
by jpl

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:19,120
and spotimage some 30 years ago i think

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,600
we recently in ogc took that on

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,360
as a standard to be maintained updated

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,360
some issues that had been long

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,480
troubling with respect to interpretation

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,440
of what that open

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,360
you know spec in the wild actually said

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,600
uh developed a compliance test

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,000
and uh you know it's widely supported

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,200
and continues to be refined in a variety

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,520
of libraries

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,640
uh the geotiff standards working group

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,000
is looking to go

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,600
you know what about big tip and a

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,080
variety of other things that might build

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,320
on

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,520
geotiff cog for example uh you know is

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,840
that relevant here

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,760
it is relevant here visualization we

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,440
have two community standards in ogc

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,840
about visualization of 3d

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,520
this one called the index 3d scene layer

00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,919
developed by esri

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,039
now an ogc community standard as well

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,400
does a really good job

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:07,679
on visualization of 3d scenes

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,240
similarly a 3d tiles standard developed

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,360
by

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,799
cesium based on gltf coming from the

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,600
kronos group

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,440
allows for visualization 3d

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,280
visualization of photogrammetry point

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,520
cloud 3d models

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,960
and terrain so some really powerful

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,480
standards and implementations and

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,000
software to go with it for 3d

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,240
visualization

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:33,440
apis so you may be familiar with

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,320
a set of web services that ogc defined

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,440
back

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,520
20 years ago they were the ogc web

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,360
services known as web map service webmap

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,160
tile service feature and coverage

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,080
service

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,080
these are implemented around the globe

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,520
there's thousands of services running

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,679
operationally there's hundreds of

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,120
thousands of data sets that implement

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,400
these

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,880
standards it's actually 1.8

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,480
million data sets it shouldn't be

00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,440
hundreds of times it should be 1.8

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,720
million

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,600
um in any case a good stable operational

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,000
base

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,600
and so the reward for that is they're

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,520
out of date they're designed in a way

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,960
that's no longer compatible with

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,200
you know the best design and

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:17,039
implementation and coding techniques

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,360
and so it's time to refresh this and so

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,720
um again referring back to that best

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,760
practices for the web

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,080
document working with w3c we defined a

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,320
spatial data on the web best practices

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,600
using things like open api formerly

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,440
known as swagger

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,960
focusing on developer experience and

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,360
usability sprints

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,039
in order to develop the apis on the

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,559
notion that these are building blocks

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,520
that can be used not only as

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,679
kind of a set of an ogc api service but

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,919
also you could pick up the pieces

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,159
of these apis and use them in your

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,679
bespoke parts of the

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,640
of your apis um so features maps

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,080
coverages

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,159
environmental data representation of zdr

00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,919
though sweet one i like there and edr's

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,799
trajectory so you can ask for a 3d

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,120
trajectory

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,000
4d trajectory it's because it's in time

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,039
right

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,600
processes records and tiles in both

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,679
vector

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,960
and raster is a really key one we've

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,159
been doing a development

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,840
set of sprints there's actually one

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:18,320
going on yesterday and today about ogc

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,200
api for features and also the common one

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,320
these will exist

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,280
along with the ows for some time but

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,120
they are under

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,640
significant development right now in

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,200
terms of sprints

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,960
approval compliance test suite harness

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,880
think of it as a test hardness even

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,720
if you don't care about compliance the

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,200
test harness is very valuable

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,480
so you can see this imagine this green

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,080
sweeping across

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,000
over the next year okay so let me give

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,360
you uh two examples i'll finish off

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,120
with two implementation examples uh that

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,960
make use of what i just described one

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,080
about cloud native and earth observation

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,559
data

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,559
and the other about urban city models 3d

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,120
city models at scale

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:01,840
so first earth observations uh we just

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,400
finished a pilot an application pilot

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,960
um that uh was cloud-native

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,520
geoprocessing earth observation data so

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,280
a real rich set of uh folks involved

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,480
with that issa should be listed here

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,960
they were the sponsor

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,280
my bad um and so european space agency

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,799
and

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,120
others there was quite a few others

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,799
involved with this

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,320
crim for example has been around

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,760
presented here in the previous

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,520
geospatial tracks

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,360
and some of the others may look familiar

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,600
to you as well

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,200
um the you know the top-level

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,720
architecture if you will there's an app

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,679
developer there's a consumer the

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,760
developer

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,960
packages things in containers deploys

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,039
them in the cloud

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,440
any cloud not a single cloud how do you

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,360
get apis that are cloud neutral

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,520
uh how do you get containers that then

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,600
can be deployed in any cloud so that

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,320
paradigm and the workflow associated

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,000
with it

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,919
and the execution workflow is really a

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,240
big part of what they developed on the

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,320
left side of that on the right side

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,280
you know the app consumer then being

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,559
able to invoke

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,080
those applications uh using apis as i

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,520
just described and then getting

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,799
encodings back i've mentioned

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,320
geotiff you may be familiar with hdf

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,559
which has been around for a while for

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,039
large data and has a cloud interface on

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,000
it

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:20,000
is an ogc standard at the abstract level

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,760
and we're looking at zar

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,440
zar is recently proposed

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,960
to become a community standard comes out

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,200
of the pangeo community

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,520
and really looking promising there we'll

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,480
see where that goes

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,640
so um packaging multiple mechanisms to

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,039
provide data in containers

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,000
cloud capabilities parallelization data

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,960
access

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,480
multiple platforms multiple clouds no

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,360
lock in a cloud vendor that kind of

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,640
thing

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,840
data sentinel landsat google earth

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,640
settlements classification maps

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,000
and in general what you'd expect uh it's

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,520
probably the workflow that you're

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,600
already doing

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,360
but this workflow has been generalized

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,279
to the apis that are

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,200
not specific to cloud not specific to

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,559
vendors have the definitions based upon

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,520
the specifications of

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,400
standards that existed before and so you

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,520
get some real

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,799
portability and um you know legacy in

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,559
terms of knowledge

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,360
of geospatial if you were to pick up

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,720
this application engineering report

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,960
so it's all published in that

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,480
engineering report which it

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,880
may not be there today but it'll be

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,559
there real soon

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,960
um this is one of the trends we do a

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,320
activity on technology tracking and this

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,320
is one of the major trends that we're

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,039
tracking in ogc about cloud native and

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,720
edge

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,039
so think about all of what we just

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,039
showed there pushed to the edge so how

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,120
do you deploy containers to the edge

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,720
how do you geospatial processing at the

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,960
edge and edge computing

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,279
fast data and stream processing at the

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,200
edge a whole raft of things that are

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,840
part of this technology trend that

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,080
that we're tracking that i i manage a

00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:01,440
cto roundtable

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:04,880
and this is you know discussed there

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:08,000
the other example um is one about

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:11,120
urban modeling and in particular

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,480
using our standard called city gml to do

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,799
energy modeling at urban scale so

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,640
helsinki uh folks from the city of

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,120
helsinki presented this just

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,240
within the last uh well maybe it's two

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,400
weeks ago now

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,400
at the ogc three-dimensional information

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,400
working group meeting

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,760
they've got a really nice atlas energy

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,559
and climate atlas

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,159
um has this kind of data about energy

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:37,360
solar heat demand

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:40,640
and geo energy uh what they then

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,520
did deploy was an open source database

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,120
called

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,919
the 3d city db it's a city gml

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,720
database using along with other

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,840
information

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,080
about the built environment

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,159
and merging that into what's called the

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,600
energy application data

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:02,640
application extension

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,400
ede data extension a schema that goes on

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,520
city gml to give you the information

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,400
about energy

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,440
is what the energy ade is all about and

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,679
so with that

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,520
uh you're able to do estimates uh

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,400
certainly do visualizations that's like

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,360
you know

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,679
easy uh the key thing is to do

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,640
simulations and predictions that allow

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,480
us to

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:27,679
plan for uh energy consumption

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,679
and heat savings also carbon dioxide

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,520
emissions and the like at the scale of

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,440
urban planning

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,919
the statistics that came out of that

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,360
show the heating demand going down

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:42,159
the co2 going down the savings

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:45,679
associated with that then predicted

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:49,039
uh based upon that energy model

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:52,640
so uh key right so again

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:54,320
uh this um use case is one that's

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,640
relevant to a technology trend that we

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,799
track about urban digital twins

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,080
uh we'll use the energy model along with

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:03,360
a variety of other

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,240
applications for urban digital twins and

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,159
this is the

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,400
topic of an event that'll happen in

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,919
january uh called urban digital twins

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,360
and our location powers

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,640
activity even though it says november

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:17,039
though it's going to be january

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,559
to finalize then i mentioned two of the

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,240
trends that we're tracking about cloud

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,480
native and edge computing

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,000
uh as well as urban digital twin but

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,200
this diagram gives you

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,559
the 12 that we're tracking um in the

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,880
tech trends you can go to the

00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,600
there's an ogc webpage about tech trends

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,039
and

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,360
as i mentioned we've got a cto

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,960
roundtable about this so

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,279
bring you back to the beginning

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,520
hopefully i've given you some sense of

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,640
why i think

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:48,399
open standards and open source play

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,880
well together um you know our role is

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:52,640
at ogc to help uh continue to refine the

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,600
open standards working with as broader

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,640
community

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,480
as possible and we see apache happen to

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,840
be an apache member

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,360
and working with the community apache

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,919
open source community

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,799
to improve the open standards is a key

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,720
aspect

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,159
i hope you find value in using those

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,760
open standards for

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:16,080
your developments so yeah there's the

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,440
1.7 number on operational data sets

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,480
actually 1.8 now

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:24,559
so that's what i have for you for this

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,399
opening talk of the geospatial track

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,000
i think we might have a couple of

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,000
minutes for some

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,039
discussion and jim i think you're

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,039
moderating that right

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:42,159
yes i'm i'm quite happy to um

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:43,600
just to go ahead and kick off uh

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,679
one question that came up while you were

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,720
speaking uh i've definitely heard

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,200
of situations where uh like you said

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,760
that

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,559
um you know continents are shifting and

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,880
so

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,080
it's not just sufficient to say okay

00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,760
i've got my

00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,600
points in whatever coordinate reference

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,559
system i should also talk about

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:05,279
uh when uh and so you illustrated that

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:08,720
with wgs84

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:11,760
and then you also said hey geojson is

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:16,000
using wgs84 um

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:17,600
is there a clear way that um

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,440
you know we should be doing something

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,880
different in geojson to

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,520
respect the fact that wgs84 should also

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,320
have that temporal information with it

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,640
yeah

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,159
when i got to that slide of uh geojson

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,600
after having presented the dynamic

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,159
datums data that exactly

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,080
thought happened in my mind as well you

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,880
know one of the real virtues of geojson

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,960
is

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,440
it is really well designed for the use

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,520
cases that it targeted right

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,799
and so for example using a single

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,399
coordinate reference system

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:52,320
is one of those virtues does geojson

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:55,120
need to address the fact that wgs 84

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,399
needs to have a date associated with

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,279
what's called the epic

00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:01,520
epoch of when that uh you know so it

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:05,039
every few years gets updated right

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,880
um you know i would leave that to um the

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,240
folks that are really good at designing

00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,240
geojson to

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,159
think about right uh it's not at all

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,240
clear is it the right choice is to

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:17,039
modify that and add a new talk to

00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,559
geojson it may be that that 1.8 meters

00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,679
for example that's the kind of scale

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:23,840
we're talking about

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,840
um may not be that relevant

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,559
absolutely uh yeah no that's that's good

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,760
to throw it back to them

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:34,000
um for the other folks um

00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,440
listening along uh feel free to ask

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,559
questions in the

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,120
uh session tag here on hoppin

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,640
um i'm trying to think what other what

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,919
did anything else like that come out

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,440
while you were presenting because i

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,360
i know that definitely happens you get

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,360
talking about something and you realize

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,200
hey i just said there's dynamic datum

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:55,279
and now i'm talking about

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:58,080
geojson did anything else uh

00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:00,240
yeah so yeah you can imagine that i do

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,240
you know this kind of presentation a bit

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,200
of a tutorial if you will with respect

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,279
to

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,440
standards geospatial standards i

00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:11,600
regularly do that

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:14,320
applying it to an open source

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,679
presentation a community makes you think

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,360
a little bit differently about okay so

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,960
where is this picked up in open source

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,960
and so in particular with respect to

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,799
that city gml

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:27,840
discussion um you know urban modeling is

00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:30,159
key right uh it's

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,240
where uh more than half the population

00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,399
is an urban environment uh

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,600
the energy consumption in cities is big

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,679
so we need to be able to do what

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,360
helsinki is doing at scale

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,960
many cities in europe and around the

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,000
globe have modeled

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,840
their cities using city gml and

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,039
so i went back and looked at that

00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,480
particular um

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:53,120
database that's used um for

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,720
city gml the city database and it's an

00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,320
open source database

00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:01,519
um it's held on a github site

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:04,720
um and so i wonder you know what um

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,399
what that community might think about um

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,640
i don't know the process that that

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,559
community uses for managing

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,080
the source code associated with the city

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:15,519
gml db

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,559
um but it might be a good conversation

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,080
to have right

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:22,159
um with an apache community in mind

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,840
so um well you know and the other thing

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,880
of course is what we're going to see is

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,320
through the course of

00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,880
uh the the track here is that there are

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:34,159
many communities working on open

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,799
source geospatial geospatial open source

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,799
uh apache has got some real leadership

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:42,320
and especially the big data area

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:45,919
um but that's not unique right um

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,279
and so how might we use some of these

00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,320
standards

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:52,320
uh to help um increase the communication

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,840
between the open source communities that

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,480
are doing geospatial

00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,080
um and so jim you might end up you know

00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,960
addressing a little bit of that in your

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,519
presentation

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,279
as well as uh some of the others that

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,000
are doing talks um

00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,960
from different communities oh uh

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,919
absolutely

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,480
uh from my work with geospatial and big

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,240
data

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,720
i feel like a lot of what i've done is

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:18,799
help glue things together

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,760
so i've had the good luck to not need to

00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:23,360
implement either

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:26,720
the big data solution on its own or the

00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,720
open uh geospatial standards uh uh like

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,760
wfs and wms i haven't had to implement

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,760
those from scratch

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,880
uh instead i've had to had a chance to

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,880
stitch them together

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:39,200
andy asks uh if city gml could be used

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,240
for modeling other infrastructure

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,720
um so um maybe the

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,519
energy use across a transport network

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,600
rather than

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,640
you know just kind of like an urban area

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,000
like a city

00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:55,039
um any thoughts on that yeah absolutely

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,080
so there is uh multiple extensions to

00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,840
city gml

00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,679
for different applications i mentioned

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,799
the energy one you saw the example from

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,519
helsinki

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,000
there's a really uh active approach

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,559
about

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,919
urban planning so the urban planning

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,000
community especially

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,399
that we just finished a project in japan

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,040
that's pretty amazing what they're doing

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:17,040
with respect to transportation city gml

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,960
has been used for transportation

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,159
and in particular for the use case

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,079
associated with

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:27,119
um well certainly transportation

00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,159
statistics if you will uh but also now

00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,079
more and more

00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:35,679
for uh autonomous vehicle scale right so

00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:38,480
curb height level information um

00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,960
there is quite a few activities that

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,200
have implemented city gml at curb height

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,720
resolution based upon lidar scans and

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,320
other scanning techniques

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,720
to get you that information to put it

00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,399
into the geometries and the semantics

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,679
associated with

00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:56,000
the built environment for transportation

00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,920
um and you know and that's that's a

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,880
whole rich conversation now

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,440
about what's called high definition maps

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,800
for

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:07,040
autonomous vehicles and so um

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,560
you know we have not only city gml

00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,760
there's also um

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:15,200
uh other standards that relate to built

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,520
infrastructure uh and linear referencing

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:20,560
for transportation that are relevant

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,320
uh when um you know we it would go

00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,880
beyond a city gml topic

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,079
but it would be a geospatial topic about

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,480
how do you model

00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,560
uh facial information for transportation

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,440
use cases for sure

00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,200
yeah um i'll just add that it was a

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,359
little mind blowing whenever

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,440
someone suggested that you could use i

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:42,560
think just the basic gml

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,359
to do just linear referencing i've

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:47,040
been so used to everything being uh two

00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,079
dimensions that you were trying to

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,760
two or three dimensions you were trying

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,800
to keep track of but they were had an

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,040
oil drilling

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,560
uh situation where you just wanted to

00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,680
know how far down the

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,760
drill pathway are you and so um

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,520
i think there's definitely possibilities

00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,240
to that that makes sense that

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,160
uh anything building on gml would have

00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:09,440
that those sort of extensions and

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,040
ways to modify things um so linear

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,960
referencing is

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,200
used in many different you mentioned you

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,079
know boreholes essentially but also then

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,880
transportation

00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,400
is heavy linear referencing and not only

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,400
in gml but other um

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,160
standards uh make use of there's an

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,960
abstract spec for linear referencing

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,839
that's really

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,760
kind of the key to all of that yep

00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,960
well we've got about three minutes

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,440
before the next talk

00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,680
uh when uh martin's gonna be speaking to

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,800
us about apache sis

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:44,079
um i think we need to pop over there

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,760
and um so we can help moderate that

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,359
uh thank you very much george anything

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,640
else we need to talk about

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:53,040
about the track no no

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,720
let's uh remind you what you get today

00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,839
that might be worth doing remember you

00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,720
do have to leave

00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,599
this right and go to the other track but

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,200
um

00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:06,560
so martin uh apache sis

00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:10,359
tom with pi geo jim with

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:12,480
geo mesa lucian with

00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:13,839
ahtsa and lucian you're gonna have to

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,599
work on that buddy man

00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:18,720
let's not roll out my dog and liz map to

00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,800
finish off the day

00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,000
so uh yeah appreciate all of your

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,359
attention jim appreciate

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,920
the conversation and discussion and

00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:29,040
um thanks yeah i agree we head over

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:37,839
there

00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:37,839
absolutely see you guys

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,079
