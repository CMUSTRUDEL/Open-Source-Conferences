Description: 
	Apache Deep Learning 301
Timothy Spann

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/


In my talk I will discuss and show examples of using Apache Hadoop, Apache Kudu, Apache Flink, Apache Hive, Apache MXNet, Apache OpenNLP, Apache NiFi and Apache Spark for deep learning applications. This is the follow up to previous talks on Apache Deep Learning 101 and 201 at ApacheCon, Dataworks Summit, Strata and other events. As part of my talk I will walk through using Apache MXNet Pre-Built Models, integrating new open source Deep Learning libraries with Python and Java, as well as running real-time AI streams from edge devices to servers utilizing Apache NiFi and Apache NiFi - MiNiFi. This talk is geared towards Data Engineers interested in the basics of architecting Deep Learning pipelines with open source Apache tools in a Big Data environment. I will walk through source code examples available in github and run the code live on Apache NiFi and Apache Flink clusters.

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,560
this is uh

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,080
ian here a little his background while

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,360
we're trying to get the

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:45,840
his audio and video connected or even

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:45,840
just audio would be okay

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,719
i might have to try to share his audio

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:58,640
some other way

00:00:52,719 --> 00:01:03,840
let's see he does not have the button

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,840
oh that's a bad time

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,840
it's got to be the same same login as

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,840
we gave to registration

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,920
that's very important i i do have two

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,360
accounts on my own

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:27,840
and that's why i can uh broadcast mine

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,840
behind me

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,000
yeah if you don't have permissions you

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,840
won't get that share button

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,079
as you can see with my other account

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,079
there

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,000
uh we might have to share his audio in a

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,240
separate

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,240
way

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,840
we'll have to see here i don't want to

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,840
lose out

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,840
i'm hoping maybe people can hear you

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,840
through uh this remote interface

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,120
let's see let me try to get to

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,800
entertaining

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,239
it's not it's the end this is the

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,319
account we used for

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,319
uh signing up the session

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
so

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,159
they they can't they can't hear you

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,840
which is probably pretty funny

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,840
because i'm having a conversation with

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,840
myself here which is

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,840
impressive

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,360
yeah let me do that

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,159
yeah no we'll do this

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,879
we'll do this pretty funny but uh so

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,400
he's gonna do the data science overview

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,239
you know obviously as you're hearing

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,560
we're having a slight

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,840
technical difficulty with him sharing

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,879
the audio

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,599
so we'll do this the old-fashioned way

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,400
and

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,640
i'll call him on the phone and hopefully

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,640
uh

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:46,239
that will sound okay if not

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,480
uh it's gonna be a very interesting time

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,480
here

00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,050
[Music]

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
ian

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,840
please turn off the audio on the

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,840
presentation

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:29,840
yeah this is uh technology at work here

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,840
this is a really professional setup here

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,960
okay okay okay let's do this

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,759
yeah so so hi i'm i'm he's broke i work

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,840
with tim like

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,440
we we're gonna keep this not corporate

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,800
at all today we're gonna keep this very

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,720
much on the uh

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,840
open source side kind of conversations

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,080
just in a high level

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,759
like what am i talking about today when

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,479
we talk about data science

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,600
and you know well traditionally the

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,600
world

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,720
um what looked like this you know if you

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,440
had a venn diagram

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,639
what data science was in the second hand

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,000
this is what this looks like so you have

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,600
to do an intersection of computer

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,960
science math

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,800
and domain knowledge you know

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,840
specifically in the area of which

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,560
you're applying dml to like you know

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,479
really

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,080
it was a focus on the intersection of

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,000
all three of those things

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,440
what i think that was a little disguised

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,960
actually i think it's the inverse that

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,960
tim can you hit the next slide please

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,120
you got thank it sir

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,000
so you know what we see really is data

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,720
science

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
is really all of these things and more

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,840
because it there are

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,680
you know clearly you've got all the

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,120
aspects the three pillars to the school

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,320
that you've had before computer foreign

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,080
knowledge but

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,600
you know really data science all of

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,120
these combinations with some extra

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,120
things right and that's the way

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,400
we can look at that deep learning system

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,720
fits deeply in

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,919
ml space i have another pretty um

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,680
diagram that kind of

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,039
displays where deep learning sits in

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,360
this space so i always like to

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,880
level set on a conversation we think

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,240
about this with a mixed audience

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,520
what where in the world we're kind of

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,520
thinking about mixed life

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,639
and then what you see though you know

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,720
the progression of complexity

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,240
um of different like what we think of

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,120
different levels of data science in

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,880
space like this you've got just 50

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,800
statistics and internal statistics here

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,199
on the left-hand side but as you keep

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,120
getting

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,319
as you keep going for the analogy party

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,199
and even things like edge time

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,600
prediction

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,280
complexity gets higher and so when you

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,800
when you think about the whole spectrum

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,800
of what we're talking about deep

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,520
learning is much more on

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,919
the more sophisticated area space of the

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,560
east

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,840
east are the data science space and for

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,360
reasons we'll get into

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,800
you do need some kind of specialized

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,400
hardware sometimes you need to watch

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,039
data stuff there is a

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,560
thing that are prerequisite that you

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,960
need to really do this well and then of

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,639
course

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,360
real-time prediction has its own

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,360
challenges too

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,759
so you know quickly here um it just is a

00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,720
level set here we'll go through this

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,800
quickly

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,319
the descriptive statistic those types of

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,240
bar charts types right

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,400
the types of things we saw in stats

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,560
class that you could kind of be used to

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,840
um think that you know you know media

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,840
mode things like that next slide

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,240
where you can use these things for

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,400
example i'm just describing a great

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,639
example with u.s census for example

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,639
um

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,360
internal statistics and inferential

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,360
statistics rather are

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,639
the defense does as well but you you

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,560
actually hit things

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,080
taking an sample of the pool of the

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,280
population you're looking at and then

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,440
you're concerning

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,800
what the greater pool would be um the

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,960
biggest thing that's the reason that we

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,720
do this racing such as students but

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,840
it would be great to know how many

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,039
people in the country like a peanut

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,039
butter jelly sandwich could

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,840
this is where we start to get to the ml

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,840
and we start thinking about

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,360
unsupervised and supervised machine

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,560
learning and keep in mind when we

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,240
thought when we could be boarding you

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,560
can have unsupervised

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,759
deep learning as well but really when we

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,360
start to think about

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,199
machine learning in the space that could

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,680
be with unsupervised

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,840
we're thinking about um algorithms that

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,000
are using data sets that aren't to train

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,840
um and so without have webbing labels

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,199
and training data the types of databases

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,199
that you can apply to these things

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,080
whether it's

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,440
in cpu or 20 but the algorithms look

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,720
like this you don't have a clust

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,560
clustering algorithm there's a very

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,080
common one

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,519
for example things of that nature but

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,479
then you also have things like a novelty

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,959
detection

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,959
um different

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,040
for example so clustering and normal

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,800
detection are are

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,560
your most common techniques again you

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,360
can do this um

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,279
unsupervised as well and i like to think

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,399
of this as a great place for if you're

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,720
if you're trying to do

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,480
um data preparation or skate engineering

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,920
using clustering algorithms for example

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,360
customers if you could

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,360
you can take a group of customers and

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,880
kind of box them down to um

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,880
categories that's kind of

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,519
different areas of your machine learning

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,519
pipeline as well

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,839
um

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:42,240
um all right i

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,320
might be flipping a flight here um so

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,519
just hit too forward but just go too

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,279
forward yeah so when we

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,880
when we think about supervised machine

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,880
reading now we're thinking

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,920
and this is the same thing we're talking

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,800
about traditional machine learning or

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,720
deep learning

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,079
if you're doing this this type of

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,959
classification

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,680
um or regression analysis like that like

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,240
you're doing

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,040
this work anyway so when you start to

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,040
look at deep learning

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,440
20 out there in that regard um next

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,440
slide

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,120
yeah so kind of going back to saying

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,839
there's a good progression

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,200
classifications of common techniques i'm

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,560
looking for falsification

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,800
is this hot dog hot dog donut or bagel

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,160
for example uh progression you could be

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,920
what is what is my home so

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,680
what is my home going to sell for if you

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,560
think about all of the real estate apps

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,120
out there

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,000
lots of lots of applications for this

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,320
today

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
and again when you get to deep learning

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,160
you're doing the same

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,279
types of process you're doing the same

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,079
thing here

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:15,040
you're just using more sophisticated

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,040
techniques to do that

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,279
so when we start to really think about

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,399
deporting we need to start thinking

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,000
about um

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,200
so the animal ring point is a little bit

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,480
different here we do some more things

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,000
but with a different animal

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,079
we start to really think about this is

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,959
neural networks and this is where the

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,720
term

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,240
learning actually kind of comes into

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,160
place here um

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,279
neural networks this itself is only

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,519
there's only one hidden

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,279
uh displays here and this is a little

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,800
fully connected

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,200
forward feeding neural networks it's

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,839
just like yourself these 1970s kind of a

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,680
style of neural cores but keyboarding

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,920
really comes in a place where you have

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,440
thousands of these layers these hidden

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,440
layers here

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,720
and these are really the engines that

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,560
that drive um

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,760
the value of like what you get out of

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,120
deep learning

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,800
but with that though there comes there

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,560
comes some caveats with performance it

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,079
comes from snapchat

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,839
what you need to do actually harness

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,920
powers though um

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,360
hit the next slide here and here's a

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,839
great example of what we see

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,399
in deep learning is great for computer

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,959
vision

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,959
techniques so there's classification of

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,920
based on the way they're walking for

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,680
example so that's a classification

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,079
problem that we saw earlier

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,600
well what really is interesting is what

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,279
we can apply

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,839
uh the types of datasets the types of

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,360
use cases things that we want to use we

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,560
can apply to deep learning

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,320
so that's what's really kind of

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,880
interesting about that but it did in

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,000
itself

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:50,639
um somewhere in a lot of nature to

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,639
traditional ml it's likely stem

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,000
and then how you know how these things

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,399
all put together is this kind of where

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,839
i'm kind of thinking

00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,680
of science itself is kind of a white

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,519
canvas here but you've got ai's you've

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,760
got traditional computer science uh

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,200
artificial intelligence theory and a lot

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,240
of things that go with that

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,800
expert systems it's a big umbrella right

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,560
so

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,480
so when you think about ai there's more

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,560
than just been held there for example

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,839
and then getting into the next layer of

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,079
the russian

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,519
ball period machine learning right so we

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,320
announced a big

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,959
set of algorithms you know this is an

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,480
area uh

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,240
theory of computer science within

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,040
artificial intelligence that

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,560
is trying to teach computers patterns

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,639
right and doing that with training

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,000
training that are our own traits such as

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,839
well and also reinforcement

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,440
which we didn't talk much about today

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,079
and then deep learning itself is

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,199
a subset of all of these three

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,519
specifically ml

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:46,000
is that it could be more sophisticated

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,320
of machine learning

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,279
and what's really great today we live in

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,120
a world where there's

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,199
lots of free libraries right there's

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,839
almost news created new models for

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,800
example

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,600
uh we have gpus that are relatively

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:03,040
cheap we've got libraries around so

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,040
i mean today we live

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,560
and then when i see um it will be

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,399
customers requires for example though

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,199
when i see organizations or even

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,360
individuals

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,880
kind of how they look at this you need

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,480
to think of your big different layers

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,279
and levels so if you want to start from

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,920
zero just to the hero you need to start

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,839
first with

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,360
your descriptive and informatics really

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,279
descriptive biggest thing here is that

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,880
you need to have a really great um great

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,560
insight into the data really build a

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,920
great foundation for that

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,920
types of things you said against bar

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,600
charts different reports for example sql

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,959
tools bi tools right these are the

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,000
things that you can do that with but

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,160
once you've built this great

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,600
foundation now you can start looking for

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,040
a product approach and that's where

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,399
machine learning comes into play where

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,000
you're looking to try to

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,760
predict you're looking for try to do

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,839
something that hasn't happened yet and

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,839
then make a decision based on that

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,120
right and that's where unsupervised

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,880
provides machine learning but more in

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,680
their traditional sense right so using

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,760
cpus

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,040
using a point of all the machine

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,399
learning you know libraries throughout

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,360
there there are plenty

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,639
um things like ids and notebooks today

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,320
before we see that

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,399
and then finally moving over what we'll

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,079
just talk about inside there is that

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,760
um you need to really get a good grasp

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,519
of those things before you

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,320
you want to be able to walk before you

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,079
can run effectively so you you can do

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,079
those things first and then you start to

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,680
bring in more sophisticated libraries so

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,880
you've got the deep learning libraries

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,399
models you think about real-time

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,720
prediction

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,920
or things of that feature so then and

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,519
ultimately even

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,120
more specifically hardware that's going

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,079
to drive that so

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,000
views are incredibly important basically

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,839
just because they're orders of magnitude

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,240
faster for training these models

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,959
then they would proceed so i mean i

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,000
literally need

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:55,199
days two minutes is order

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,560
faster as far as training goes

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,160
you know at the end of the day that's

00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,040
the progression we're looking at it's

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,279
all about

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,120
you know starting starting at one level

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,880
you know gaining up and then taking

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,880
steps for the next players and

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,120
um computer science is effectively the

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,120
same

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,639
yeah now we don't have to do this over

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,680
the phone here

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:23,360
yeah we'll hang up and i'll

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:26,639
i'll leave this on dude okay okay

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,920
uh sorry for the technical issues there

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,279
uh hopefully uh you're able to hear what

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,320
uh

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,720
ian was talking about uh we'll have the

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,480
slides here and he's got some

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,320
great githubs and some other materials

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,079
that we'll publish in the future

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,399
i'm tim spann if you were around

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,759
yesterday i was in a couple tracks

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,839
around streaming

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,240
so how streaming have to do with uh deep

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,880
learning

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,000
well as you can see there's a whole

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,240
bunch of things some

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,680
somehow these talks connect and the

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,880
connecting thing is

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,160
is streaming so

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,959
i've done parts of this talk uh

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,600
before this is the latest greatest

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,240
version

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,000
with that great intro from ian because

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,839
before i just kind of dive into it

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,240
because i'm a data engineer i want to

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,559
get

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:21,360
data to uh work with these algorithms

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,640
so i will include links here to the uh

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:27,280
previous three or so

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:29,679
sessions that i've done to make taking

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,160
these data science products and making

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,760
them available to people

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:39,280
is uh i've been able to enable them

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,600
into nine five directly apache nine five

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,600
is

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:45,679
uh a tool i've talked about a lot

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,919
this really allows you to do some of the

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,480
the basic level streaming of

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,760
grabbing things from somewhere like

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,960
behind me i've got

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,400
a jetson and an nvidia xavier and some

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,600
raspberry pi's

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,080
they all have cameras i'm running deep

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,080
learning

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,360
there but at a minimum i'm grabbing

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,600
camera images

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,600
this could be whatever you need camera

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,559
images for i've got it on a real-time

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,760
vehicle

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:15,120
we send those camera pictures into nifi

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,280
because it can accept images and as

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,559
those images come in i can push them

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,679
through

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:25,039
a processor what we call these boxes

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:28,080
and i have one that does mxnet i've got

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:31,360
one that's using a newer framework

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,960
uh deep java library this is from the

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,039
same people as mxnet

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,160
it works with all those mxnet things you

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,559
had before

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,840
but it's really fast in java which is

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:43,120
helpful for

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,520
apache knives find some other projects

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,880
out of the box you get pre-built models

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:51,039
for action recognition

00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:54,000
classification segmentation

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,280
question and answer sentiment analysis

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,320
and it's using

00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,480
not just mxnet models but

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,480
uh today i'll show you two processors i

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,679
wrote they use this engine to run pi

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,240
torch models

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,039
you can also run tensorflow and onyx so

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,600
this really

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,880
opens up all those models wherever you

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,640
build them whether you build them in

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,440
something like on our machine learning

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,799
tool

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,919
you're in own jupiter notebook some

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,919
cloud-based tool you get those models or

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,640
use a pre-built one

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,679
and you can deploy that as part of a

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,400
stream

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,960
now you saw that difficulty scale as

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,840
you're

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,360
moving up the chain into deep learning

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,440
one thing that happens is

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,400
yeah you built a model which was awesome

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,840
you spent

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,600
how many hours or very expensive gpus or

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,720
tpus training them

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,120
you have this great model how do i get

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,000
it

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,600
to the place where the data is and with

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,960
apache nifi

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,480
i can put those models right in the

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,280
place where they need to be whether

00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,559
that's in minify at the edge

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,720
in process where we're where we are

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,120
and one of those ways is to have these

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,200
native processors and nifi

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,159
so i could just have a model there like

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,159
for here

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,919
i've got one that does uh ssd so single

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,520
shot detection on these images that

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,559
they're coming in

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,600
after this session in the chat is paul

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,320
vidal

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,960
he and i have a session after that which

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,360
is

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,679
again focused on this similar topic

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,799
he's got a very interesting slant on

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,039
that

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,120
so if you have questions you can harass

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:38,400
him early since he's here

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:41,280
but this processor is very easy to use

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,919
you drop it in a directory nifi starts

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,400
using it

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,159
you push an image into it and you get

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,799
back

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,600
results from this and also you get a new

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,240
image

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,080
and that image has the highlights of

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,720
where this bounding box is

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,320
so that's a nice feature uh if you want

00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,760
with the power of knife i could keep

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,520
that raw image

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,360
and send it somewhere else so i don't

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:07,679
lose it i also have

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:10,480
all the results of that deep learning

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,679
as attributes and nifi so you have that

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,880
as metadata

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,080
along with your change image so it makes

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,200
it for a really nice

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,600
way to run models uh now if you're going

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,360
to do

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,039
want to create things on your own with

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,960
dgl it's very

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:30,799
easy i use maven you can also use gradle

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,559
uh right now it's in version 0.80

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:35,039
i've got to update this slide that

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,840
changed two days ago

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,799
and you just pick a couple of things

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,120
pick what kind of

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,400
thing you want from the pre-trained

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,480
models

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,000
put in some values build it and you're

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,400
ready to go

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,600
it took me almost no time to write a

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,480
processor to do

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,240
sentiment analysis and i'll show you uh

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,480
a little the code in intellij

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,640
since we're at apache con i think it's

00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,600
okay to show code

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,159
i don't think people are going to

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,559
complain there and then i also this one

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,480
i like

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:09,120
better and i have a a one that actually

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,600
kind of talks about paul here keep you

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,400
uh

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,360
interested paul uh the distilled burp

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,360
model

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,159
uh from pi towards did you question and

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,720
answers now it's not

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,000
it's a pre-trained model so it's not

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,080
trained on

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,679
you know any corpus interested in the

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,320
data i have

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:31,440
but it's not too bad it's doing pretty

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,760
well so i'll show you a demo of that

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,799
and uh we'll get out of the slides and

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,520
go into

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:39,520
code which is probably more interesting

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,320
so first up let me show you

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,120
the really exciting part you know people

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,919
like to see

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:50,320
dark code streams in uh in intellij

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,360
well this is a unit test which i hope

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,080
everyone

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,039
does unit tests i i do less than i

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,559
should

00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:00,400
what's nice with uh apache nifi is you

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,080
never have to write java code

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,720
but if you want to put in your own

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,640
custom model or custom code you write

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,200
your own processor

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,360
writing a knife processors about the

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,600
easiest thing you're ever going to do

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,000
maven builds you an archetype with all

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:19,039
the boilerplate pieces here

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
you just have to set some parameters

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:24,320
and make sure they're here and then call

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,919
whatever your custom code is

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:31,760
and the custom code here to do

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:35,280
djl is trivial this is pretty much

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:38,000
the entire bit of code to write deep

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,520
learning it's calling this model as you

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,880
see i'm calling for this one

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,000
object detection uh it's the backbone

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,880
model

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,320
i pass in a couple of options here none

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,640
but you could have some

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,080
it pulls it out of the model zoo i

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,279
applied it to the pi

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,799
torch engine it knows what platform i

00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,240
built this on

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,159
so if you're going to build it and

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,320
deploy it to another

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,080
uh kind of server you're going to have

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,000
to build it there

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,679
or use a pre-built model maybe i could

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,799
pre-build it for

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,480
it has them for linux mac and windows

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,919
you can pre-build it and have that

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,840
deployed

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,440
and then it picks the engine here i just

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,880
look at the top

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:24,640
five models and then i just put them

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:27,679
into a result class so i could return it

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,960
so when you get to returned it shows up

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:33,679
in nifi and will

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,279
show you what that looks like i still

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,200
have a couple more minutes here before

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:40,000
we got to go to that next session

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,679
i think we have what do we have ten

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,600
minutes

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,880
i think we have or five minutes five

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,320
minutes i think

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,960
so let me show you that so what i use

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,640
this processor for

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,720
as you see you can figure out what the

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,520
model is here

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,080
what kind of resources did you use now

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,039
because

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,640
it's a pre-trained model and i'm just

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,039
running classification

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,400
i'm running this on my laptop which is

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,760
an old power book

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:12,960
there is no gpu here

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:15,279
it's a very old cpu nothing impressive

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,240
running the models i don't need anything

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,039
now i do have

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,679
edge devices behind me and we'll talk

00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:24,880
about the coral ai in the next session

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:27,120
and we can uh you could do some training

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,080
on these i have a xavier nx

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,919
that has enough gpu to do some minor

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,320
training especially with the new

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,360
nvidia jetpack that's kind of outside of

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,039
apache

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:41,840
but for what we're doing here no gpu

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,520
and this would run it could run on a

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,520
yeah jetson's great it could run on a

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,159
raspberry pi

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,559
generally we run minify on a raspberry

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,120
pi

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,760
because the resources are low but if you

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,279
get that new

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:58,799
8 gig one you definitely run nine five

00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:00,400
nifi is uh has this gui so there's a

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,799
little bit of overhead there

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:05,039
but if you run it on an eight eight gig

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,360
machine like the new raspberry pi

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,440
that would be plenty i don't need gpu

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,919
for running this

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,880
uh let's see if we got any data to send

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,919
to that one

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,559
i also have

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,400
a couple of other ones that i just did

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,600
for

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,360
for natural language

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,200
let's see if we have any data floating

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,120
around

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,799
try to pass some data to people let's

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,480
see that's not an

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:37,919
image i should run that one

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,440
but let me just show you uh what we can

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,480
do with that

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,840
i have one here that is doing

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:49,039
uh sentiment analysis

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:52,320
oh i left that running probably a lot of

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:55,600
a lot of messages there uh

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:58,080
nifi lets me run things on a schedule so

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,919
i might have scheduled a lot so what i'm

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,840
doing here is this is the one for

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:06,559
uh q a so i pass in a question

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,320
pass in a description and then i get the

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:11,360
results back

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:13,039
i i've ran this for a couple of hours

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,720
now this morning

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,360
and then we could see the results with

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,679
an iphone

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,559
this was the data that came in it was

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,919
just uh

00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:27,120
adjacent feed and then we could see what

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:29,200
the prediction was so

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,200
if i didn't have a really good question

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:35,360
i used a generic one

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,919
which was why that seemed like a good

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,559
reason

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,039
so this was a news article and i said

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,360
why

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,600
and it said it made a prediction of a

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,760
series of words together

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,360
so that's kind of interesting i'm going

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,000
to show you one where i'm

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,640
calling it the arrest api just to

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,720
trigger

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,880
uh some data and i have

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,200
i could find the right screen i have a

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,039
little curl here that says paul that all

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,080
likes magic the gathering

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:06,480
and then the question is he likes what

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,279
so let's see what we get here i sent

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,320
that rest call into nine five

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:14,480
knife i got it uh

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,679
didn't like that question right now

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,600
sorry paul

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,799
did we get our sentiment analysis on

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,880
paul

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:24,080
we probably did let's see what the

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,080
sentiment is on that one

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,840
we got our results back uh this was a

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,320
different one we have

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,360
i accidentally ran a lot of data through

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,080
here

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,840
so i i put it in the raw classification

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,440
so you could just see that if you wanted

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,320
to parse this on your own

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,720
and i used to put individual fields so

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,120
this was a very neutral statement

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,279
there's about 50 50 on it so it's

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,840
probably just an informational statement

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,600
that came in from news yeah that's just

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,720
describing uh

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,440
azure files so nothing too controversial

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,360
there

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,760
i think we are out of time and i don't

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,080
want to take up someone else's time

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,120
we have a session right after this with

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,159
paul

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,480
so come out of here go back in there and

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,600
then look for

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,960
edge to ai

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,679
with uh edge to cloud with pulvin

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,039
allenby

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:22,399
actually that's at 2 15.

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:24,720
it's 205 maybe we have a little longer

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:27,279
i don't see a red light coming on so

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,679
i'll push it a little bit longer here

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:32,480
so if you looked at the results i was

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,640
pushing these to slack channels

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,960
so uh it's a very nice way for me to

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,919
debug things is just send information to

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,279
slack

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:45,120
as i'm doing these uh analytics and it's

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,120
a pretty straightforward thing to do

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,840
so let's see if i can pass in and get us

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,559
an image

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,240
i thought i had some floating around as

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,279
you can see there's that coral he was

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,240
talking about

00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:59,360
this one i have a jet bot this is a

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,039
raspberry pi

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,880
running uh a movidius accelerator

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,559
i've got one that's running a coral

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,799
accelerator

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:11,679
there's a bunch of different ones i

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:14,559
should have been sending some data here

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,840
i forgot to send a bunch of data i

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:19,760
should probably start up

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:24,240
all these uh minify agent

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:28,080
here the xavier has uh

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:30,799
i have three cameras on it so that's a

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,840
a lot of a lot of data there i'm going

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:35,279
to start up my

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,880
minify agents so i can start sending

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:40,159
data

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,320
i forgot that i stopped all these

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,640
because i was uh running some other

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,640
stuff

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,480
but we'll start sending a whole bunch of

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,240
data in

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,399
i think i get a couple of minutes maybe

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,080
we'll get some data in that time

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,679
if you're interested all this is in

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,960
github so if you want to

00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,480
uh take a look at these models maybe put

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,880
your own in here

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,240
instead of using mine some of these they

00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,519
have the option of switching

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,039
engines so if you want to try a pi torch

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,360
version of a model

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,080
or an mxnet version or a tensorflow

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,559
version

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,440
and see what the results are now for

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,760
some of them

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,480
you had to pick one or the other like

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,760
for uh

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,760
birch the mxnet model is not trained on

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,320
all the uh parameters so you have to

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,320
limit the some of the sizes there

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,200
that proved to be a pain so i switched

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,159
to doing uh

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,960
uh just pie torch but you could do uh

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:40,320
the same for the other ones

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,000
uh pretty straightforward what's nice is

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,960
you don't have to do any of this coding

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,080
if you're just gonna download and use

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,679
the model that i pre-trained let's see

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,960
if we can get some data in here

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:55,919
i don't have any images yet oh some data

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,120
is coming through give me one image

00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,360
that's with the problem i have like

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:03,279
thousands of sensors but uh

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,279
not as many cameras as they should have

00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,840
now i do have a a nifi processor that

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,080
grabs your webcam

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,519
i'm afraid to grab my webcam while we're

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,840
doing this uh

00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,919
presentation we've had enough audio

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,960
visual issues with this

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,559
i don't really want to break that

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,360
but the the process is pretty

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,360
straightforward

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,200
this if anyone has any more questions uh

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,320
we got paul

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,039
and ian on there and uh john coochback

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,360
who are all

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,640
kind of experts here you can see my

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,840
exciting

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:42,080
images here from uh previous captures

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,600
i don't know how it thinks that's a boat

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,120
that's one of the pictures from one of

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,840
the devices

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,960
uh it looks like it's taken a picture

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,240
over

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,760
my uh nvidia jet boots and so that's

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,000
probably the xavier

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,519
and it's it figured out who i was even

00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,559
from the back of my head so that's

00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,039
pretty cool

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,320
i'm not sure where it thinks the boat is

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,120
and then i had another

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,159
project a different algorithm analyze

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,120
this picture

00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,600
that already had the annotations on it

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,760
so

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,519
that gets a little uh a little weird

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,360
there

00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,720
i know this kind of looks like a chair

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,640
but maybe not

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,480
i think i i ran down our time

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,200
sufficiently here

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,480
uh join me and paul in the next session

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,799
in a few minutes

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,399
hopefully all the audio and visual work

00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,640
properly there

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,679
if you have any questions i've got this

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,399
session

00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:38,799
and then we've got one more at uh

00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:39,440
255 which is going to be a really cool

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,799
one

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:47,120
my friend sunil did some awesome iot

00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:49,360
stuff it should be pretty awesome so uh

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:53,840
i'll see you in the next session thanks

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,840
for joining

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,039
