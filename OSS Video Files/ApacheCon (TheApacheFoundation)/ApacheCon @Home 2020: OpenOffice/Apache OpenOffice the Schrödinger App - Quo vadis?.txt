This talk will be a general talk on the situation on the Apache OpenOffice project. I will outline the situation where we are today. Outline a bit the difficulties we have moving to the future. To understand the title see Clabuurn's article at https://www.theregister.com/2018/10/10/apache_open_office_not_dead/ ) Measure position - A short summary on current project state Messure the speed - what is underway and where we go. the project blur effect - A short view on our difficulties and Gaps that we have

[Music]

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,360
um so the intent was

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,440
um of this talk to give everyone a

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,480
little bit of overview

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,480
and um

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,879
yeah a site where we go where we come

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:49,039
from what is going on

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:52,719
and yeah my name is peter kovach

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:56,000
i joined the project in 2016

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,879
um when i read that there was

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,879
a lot of need of

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:06,799
helpers and people

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:10,000
and i thought yeah

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,119
a good project i can do my free time

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and i want to keep open office alive

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:21,920
i was then chairman from 2017 to 2019

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,080
um where you can see that my most

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,680
engagement was more less on the

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,830
programming level

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,520
more on the organizational level

00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:33,280
[Music]

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,640
i do development stuff as

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,640
i managed to do it

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,840
and mostly i'm orientating myself and we

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,680
will see

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:49,200
how huge open office is in a minute

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,280
the agenda i want to give a general

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,399
project introduction

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,520
um if you want a

00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,000
short going through history

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,759
so you get feeling where open office

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,040
comes from

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:08,399
um then i want to look with you

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:12,560
not into the code but very high level

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:15,520
at the code um i want to look with you a

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,480
little bit into the build environment

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,879
what we have there what we tools we use

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:26,879
and stuff like that and i want to go

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:30,290
into the web support stuff

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,800
which we maintaining

00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:36,480
[Music]

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:40,080
yeah as far as i hope

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,120
that this will um suit you um

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,200
yeah so

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,140
yeah you see now this is a little bit of

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,280
mind stuff um

00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,319
[Music]

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,480
yeah i had no much time so sorry for if

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,680
the slides are a bit chaotic

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,280
so project introduction um open office

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,480
has been

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:09,159
yeah you could say became open source

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:12,879
from star office so birth is in 2000

00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:13,440
openoffice.org and the release in 2002

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,519
as

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,720
version 1 and it was a real success

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,720
story

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,760
until let's say until 2010

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,280
oracle acquires sun and then we have the

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,440
first

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,080
nick of it um the fork of liberal office

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,879
where some people thought they'd be

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,920
better off

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,879
in another project i don't want to judge

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,400
that in any way

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,400
just this makes

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,120
this is for me at least the current

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,040
turning point

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,040
of sorts and

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:58,560
at that peak time openoffice has also

00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,239
projected 100 million users at the end

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,720
of 2010

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,840
so you can say quite very successful

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,000
very um

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,280
[Music]

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,560
very highlighted a lot of fame

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,440
in that time and after that

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,320
i mean a year later oracle steps down

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,759
and

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:26,840
donates the code to apache foundation

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:30,880
in 2012 um the project

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:34,400
um graduates from the incubator

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,880
and becomes a top-level project i have

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,520
not

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:43,199
mentioned that here in 2014

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:46,400
ebm leaves the participate

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:51,759
or ebm participates for the last time

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:55,720
in release of for 4.1.1

00:04:51,759 --> 00:05:00,720
and today we are at the release

00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,720
4.1.7 and we have

00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,600
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:09,280
downloads at the moment

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,160
so as you can see there is a

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,520
in this in this short very rough history

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,360
i mean there's a lot of

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,960
more and you could might go much more

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,000
deeper and deeper

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,600
but you can see there is a there's a

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,560
kind of

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,199
in the first slide in the first part you

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,560
we have a

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,440
up rise and then you have the feeling of

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,120
people leaving

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:36,400
and going so and the development

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,360
yeah goes down definitely i mean in last

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,360
six years we did

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,440
mostly maintenance releases and

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,919
some people think it's bad i think it's

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:50,840
cool because we are still here

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:53,600
people still get a maintained

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,960
project and so on and

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,840
it's working for them yeah so if it's

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,680
working for them

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,880
you can see on this slide here um

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,800
there's still a lot of users i mean um

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:11,039
in one um

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,240
i mean if you if you count if you count

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,240
every download

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:20,160
um per month then we end up

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:23,759
between roughly 1.4 million

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,800
and 2.3 million on the top

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,319
and on average 1.7 million yeah you can

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,960
see here uh

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,000
slowly slow decrease if you want to see

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,199
that

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,759
but i think it's still

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:42,880
quite a lot of downloads for um

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:47,199
yeah for people not using it but so i

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,199
would say people are using this software

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:55,440
and not not a few of them quite a lot

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,360
yeah so

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,479
if you are interested in more of the

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,520
history

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:05,199
i think it's a good place to go

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,840
to visit the um the talk

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,840
streiflist

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:17,199
which is in german

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:20,319
so i i'm sorry for that

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,800
if i tried to organize something that we

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,960
get that

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,560
in english somehow maybe with under

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,599
title subtitles but

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,039
yeah very complicated thing but i'm very

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,960
happy this talk

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,759
comes to life as a lot of talks we have

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,440
this year

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:40,960
and i think everyone is a

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,960
is a good thing yeah

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:50,879
so yeah

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,879
let's go into the code yeah

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:58,560
if we talk about the code we

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,360
approach quite a lot of

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,479
apaches not a small application it's a

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,919
big one

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:08,000
and so it's not so easy and we have seen

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:12,080
there are lots of users

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,879
that using the software so we

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,039
cannot just change something from left

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:21,039
to right or something like that

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,039
so we have we need some

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:28,560
good way of

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,759
releasing the software in first place so

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,720
in the past we had

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,720
almost only

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:41,039
getting committer add-ins on our

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:44,000
svn and if there is an outside

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,720
patch one committer has to commit it and

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,200
then

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:51,120
test it and we always did this release

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,440
branch

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:58,560
so um res branching

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:02,240
so we have um currently we maintain

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,680
two release branches which is the four

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,200
point one point

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:10,399
four point four point one

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:14,720
x on or for 2x

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:17,920
um for 2x is the um

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:22,320
upcoming release if you want the next

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:25,839
generation on 4.1 x

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:30,000
is the old really old if you go back

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:33,839
into the history i mean the 4.1

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,160
0 was i mean ibm was participating in

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,160
that

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,519
and a 4.2 release

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,839
[Music]

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,839
is

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,480
it's yeah in the pipe for four years now

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,760
i think

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,360
yeah pretty one pretty much since i

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,399
joined the project

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,600
but it's still not satisfying stable

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:07,279
so there's still bugs going around and

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,399
we are still hunting stuff down um

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:13,680
and or we are still looking for fixing

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,720
bugs yeah when they will fix

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:20,480
there's no real time plane because

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:24,800
most people today work on pro bono

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:28,320
or um as volunteers as

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:33,440
mostly said and

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:37,440
ebm was the last big company leaving the

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:41,519
leaving the project i mean in os2

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:44,320
there is some community fun

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,320
financed

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,399
development going on but this is mainly

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,760
focusing on

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:55,200
porting open office 202

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,399
and not so much

00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,440
developing it at least as far as i'm

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:05,600
aware of so

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:09,120
in the last year or two

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,120
we switched to git

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,000
and with switching to get

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:19,839
the link or the the site in github

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,279
became active and we can now accept

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,279
um prs

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:31,600
or yeah from the community

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:35,040
p there's really low ex um

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:38,480
excessive uh there's a really low

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:41,600
level of um bringing code

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:46,490
to us through github which is uh

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:48,000
which is an um great

00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:51,600
[Music]

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,920
great development and people are

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,120
looking into the code and fixing

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,600
something or

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,200
telling us yeah here there you can fix

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,160
that on that

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,959
this one or how about changing this yeah

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,320
there's some

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,320
some communication going on

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:13,360
um around that and gives the project

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:17,760
much much more visibility and well

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:20,399
as i said volunteers have an easier way

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,800
of adding it we have a little bit of an

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,600
issue

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,079
getting the code really accepted because

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,200
we need

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:30,480
testing the stuff we want to have a

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,120
we want to we don't have the resources

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,800
to

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:38,320
bug to debug things

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:41,440
over and over there there are enough

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:45,519
issues left from the past

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,920
so the um the project uh the the

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,560
not project that the process to get code

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,519
in

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,639
is not really settled at the moment so

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:57,920
we need to work a little bit on that

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,240
to get there a little bit more speed on

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,680
it

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,030
but it's definitely a good way

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,720
to

00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:07,920
[Music]

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:13,120
to introduce new fixes

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,120
extend not extensions but um

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:24,079
code improvements yeah or basic features

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,680
um if we look

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,279
a little bit deeper if you're coming

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,279
from the release and we look

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,519
into a little bit more into the code

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,880
this is the lowest code i want

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:38,399
lowest look and take a look into the

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:42,480
code i want to take to in this talk

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:46,720
you will see that open office consists

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,720
of a lot of pieces and

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:53,760
um smaller

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:58,000
i would say units or modules

00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:02,000
um they are not really a library

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,199
because they are not very independent

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,710
but we have this the uni uno

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,800
um

00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:12,079
[Music]

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,320
interface system um

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,279
which is a core component currently

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,639
under in

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:22,160
open office then we have the basic

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,160
language um

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,839
of course we have on and on the top we

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,399
have the the applications yeah and you

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,450
see

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,320
that

00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:36,160
[Music]

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:41,360
language modules l10 or e18n

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,360
are considered with languages are

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:51,760
are coming um are taking place or

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:55,199
um linking into the code at a lot of

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:59,199
places yeah so the code is

00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:02,720
as this picture also so

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:05,180
not so easy to get into

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,300
so you need some time you need to to

00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,300
[Music]

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,639
jump into the code you need to look

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,680
where and how you can you can change

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,279
something and

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:22,240
you need to extensively test it because

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,240
it's not really um

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:30,399
always that good isolated yeah

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:34,079
so if you look at bringing

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:37,120
if you want to to make a change

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,279
what skills do you need java is a

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,959
open office is a multi-language

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,360
application

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,040
mostly written in c plus but not

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,120
everything

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,120
there's a lots of java from

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,360
i'm told for example a lot of wizards

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:59,279
are written in java

00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:02,880
make files are there xslt

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:04,959
post scripts c i think personally

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,880
c is a little bit misleading because a

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:11,600
lot of c plus stuff is

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:15,199
in reality more c-style c-plus plus

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:20,720
and also other languages are

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:20,720
used perl and python for example

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,480
and for that we will see a little bit

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,199
more

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,399
in another slides i took the numbers

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,600
from github yeah

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:34,720
so i trust them that they

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:38,320
aligned the code right

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:41,360
um if you want to see learn more about

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,800
the code stuff i would really

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:49,680
recommend to you um looking into

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:52,639
the talk from jim building apache on

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,639
on mac os

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,839
which is really helpful if you

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,600
if one developer starts and says i want

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,079
to

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,880
help you guys or want to have the

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,559
project

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,120
um to to work a little bit better or

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,280
something

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,559
i'm interested in open office the first

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,079
thing we usually tell

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:19,839
is try to build open office first time

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,839
it's an adventure on its own

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,760
um yeah or

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:30,079
look the um watch the um the talk of

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
um

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,280
um carl

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,679
um about the open office junior

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,000
programming with

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,760
ruby i mean i think this is a this is

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,200
awesome

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:54,160
feature i think written as an extension

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:59,039
right carl um

00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:02,799
and yeah a lot of features

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,160
are done in open office as an extension

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,440
and not

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:12,640
included in the basic software i mean

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,640
open office has the strategy to keep

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,799
people to keep stable

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,240
and so we do not change the core so much

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,200
yeah we want to

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,679
take the core together wanted to have it

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,679
stable

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,160
people that use open office

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:36,799
are usually not very

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:40,000
tacky styled and not digital leaders

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,280
they're happy if they if they manage

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,360
what they came

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:48,480
what they opened the app for yeah

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,840
and there some conservati

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:56,480
is i think is a feature

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:59,919
not a bug

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:03,360
okay if we go further on

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,960
into um developing open office there are

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,400
lots of other resources

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:11,840
yeah um there is the wiki

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,840
which is um

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,720
which contains also some developer

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,400
information

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:25,520
there i think the best entry point is

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:28,799
the architecture um

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:31,840
um category side

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:34,160
um where you see

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,520
a rough overflow which topics are

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,840
covered by the

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,840
in in the wiki um

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,320
we will talk about the wiki a little bit

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,960
later in detail

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,840
or in from a different perspective not

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,840
in detail but and from a different

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
perspective

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,039
and we will end you as i said before we

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,320
have this

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,919
the you know layers which um if we go

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,039
back into the

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:10,480
architecture you see

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:13,919
that there is always the uni

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:17,120
you know for example are always

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,679
also not all not

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,159
only a module on the bottom but they're

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,799
all

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,320
also gluing the middle and the top

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,360
together

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:30,000
and one thing is

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,120
the edl reference which is basically the

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,440
api

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,159
from open office at least to my

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,159
understanding

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:42,720
um if we need to look at the code search

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,320
the code we use opengrock

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:50,080
we have the instance on opengrock open

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,280
the openoffice.org we use

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,320
bugzilla

00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:58,720
[Music]

00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:02,480
which contains the

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,559
bugs opened up from

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,480
i think from the first day you can find

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,039
bugs um

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,919
at least if i look search for open box i

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,600
found

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:16,720
10 000 open bucks and

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,200
yeah and it looks like

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,200
it's more

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,320
um paxilla is more cutting the search

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:28,000
list than

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:30,080
um that's all the bugs so

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,120
if you then start looking into the box

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,360
some are

00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:38,480
enhancements requests some are

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,760
duplicates some are

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,840
some notes someone has taken and never

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:48,000
closed it

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,520
stuff just because there are a lot of

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,760
open

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:56,960
issues it doesn't mean

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,360
they're all relevant and so it's

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,200
really really difficult to find the

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,120
relevant and

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:08,400
problematic stuff so i opened

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:12,400
another tracking on

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:15,440
jira just to get an overview which

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,960
so the jira tickets

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,760
or are more like epics and they try to

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,159
collect the baczilla bugs and order them

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,200
i mean i could do it in baxilla probably

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,440
but

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:33,120
i thought it might be better

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,840
if the this is something

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,120
where we have more of an overview if

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,840
it's a little bit of a

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,159
refreshed start but not losing the old

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,400
and

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,720
still working the old we had a

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,480
discussion if we want to drop boxilla in

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,679
favor of jira but

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:54,559
baxilla has his favorite despite its old

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:57,120
it's very very fast

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,280
and not everyone has a good internet

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,320
connection

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:06,080
so we stick with paxilla and try

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,080
to work around it

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:13,520
yeah there's also i didn't notice it a

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,080
azira confluence wiki which is more used

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,120
for

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:20,400
project organization than

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:24,880
for the wiki but that's

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,880
maybe later yeah

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:32,559
as you see um

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,559
there's a lot of stuff

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:39,120
if you look at the building tools in the

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,320
code section of

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:46,480
github you could see that there are some

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,520
make files these make files divide

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,559
themselves

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,120
currently between dmag and g make

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,760
then we have parts that are compiled

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,600
with

00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:01,440
and mostly or i think and is used for

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:04,880
java then we have various

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,520
scripts for example the edl needs to be

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,480
generated

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:13,760
from or there's a code generator around

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,760
it that use the edl

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,840
then we have some scripts that handle

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,840
versioning

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,720
the d make g make an

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,520
end a build system are connected through

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,840
both

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:33,919
perl scripts yeah

00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,520
if you want to maintain that it's a very

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:40,000
complicated

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:44,240
system um a lot of history

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:48,320
you find in them in in the setup

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:51,760
it's grown um we tried to move to

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,480
gmac but run into various issues around

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,080
it

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:59,679
so the current idea

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:02,880
plan is to move to s-cons which is

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,880
based on python

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:10,000
and so our hope is to move everything

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:12,400
into this combination and we will keep

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,400
only

00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,799
um things that

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,080
um we need for building open office and

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:23,200
we cannot

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,240
we cannot do with this s con with s cons

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,279
and python yeah

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:32,640
okay i mentioned here open crop again

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:36,000
which is important um because

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:39,919
um the code is so huge

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,960
you need to um you need to find

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:45,039
the crosslinks if you look at code if

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,840
you want to change something you should

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:50,720
change what is else affected what could

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,720
be the impact

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:59,679
and this makes changes small and

00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:03,279
careful yeah also in the future at least

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:06,080
if it's because for me um um

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,720
and that the environment goes also into

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,919
modern

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:14,000
eda current ede

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:18,000
can help you with can

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
help you with code

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:25,120
structuring a little bit or

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:28,159
browsing or maybe

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:30,720
be a little bit different than opengrock

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,279
in in terms of searching code get or

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,559
getting code together

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:40,159
but since the edl

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:43,840
environment we have edl is we describe

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:46,720
an ape part as an

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,720
xml file and the code generator

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,850
generates a code to it

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,799
again this is my understanding

00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:58,720
[Music]

00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:02,320
then not always

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:05,840
ede or opengrop can make this link

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:08,880
through the edl yeah because it's very

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,880
specific to open office

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,240
i think only libra office still

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,039
maintains this

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,039
technique if they do i don't know

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:24,799
so web extension so as i said before

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:27,919
um if we look at open markets it's

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:31,360
only very core

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:34,960
basic the more or less fundamentals

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,360
the really important

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,600
features that an office suites needs

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,799
from our view

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:46,320
and if this is gets extended or

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:48,240
if we add new features or other people

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,159
add new features

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:55,360
these goes as web extensions

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,360
we host them under

00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,640
extensions.openoffice.org

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,640
i found from my access that we have

00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:08,159
512 extensions published

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:11,679
which is quite a lot and i heard

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,760
that you can do

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,080
that you can add a lot of good features

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,080
i mean

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:25,200
pdf compatibility or

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:31,840
latex compatibility i heard i think

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:31,840
best is there maybe also to talk to

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:41,039
um i think

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:44,720
mctilde can maybe talk to

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:48,080
what can be done on this stuff

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:51,120
or how um open office can be extended

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:55,679
it's a question often

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:59,520
i hear that is asked on

00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:05,120
our open office stands

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,120
which the or tables that we have on the

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,960
on events here in europe where mesh

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,399
tilde

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:15,600
and michelle are visiting

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:18,960
they have their tour which is now due to

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:22,559
corona not taking place

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:25,679
yeah if there is any issues with this

00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:27,520
um with the extension papers extension

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:31,279
tapes

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:34,520
extension pages then

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:37,120
the best address address is sysadmin at

00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:40,000
openoffice.org because this was always

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:43,360
an issue a little bit

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,399
that people did not know where to go

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:49,919
when they had issues

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:54,480
so looking at the wiki

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:56,399
the wiki is a really huge stuff i mean

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,399
it took me a little bit of research but

00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:02,000
12 almost 12 000

00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:05,120
content pages and over 13 000

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,640
files i think this is really a lot

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,679
yeah there's also a lot of

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:15,520
issues um around the web wiki

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:17,900
um and

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,440
um keith has

00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:22,570
[Music]

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,760
started documentation

00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:29,120
[Music]

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,520
endeavor or project um to

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,039
where where we hope that people joining

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,679
this

00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,159
and maybe this is one part that can be

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,200
fixed

00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:42,960
someday i don't know

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:47,679
but there's a lot of stuff

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,679
needs to be looked at old stuff

00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,120
um

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,440
yeah some some content

00:30:53,120 --> 00:31:01,440
was not touched since 2005.

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:04,640
maybe that's not really modern today

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,039
on the other hand open office does not

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,799
change a lot so we since we are very

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:12,640
conservative

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:16,320
also a lot of information stays valid

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,320
at least in parts yeah

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,360
um and

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:23,039
still accurate today and can be used if

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,519
you just

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,519
try it

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:37,120
um yeah we have also other pages

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:40,240
this is and the normal page is giving me

00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:43,200
some riddles

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,919
i'm just not very good at distinguishing

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,039
them

00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:51,360
there we have a project page

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:54,640
um i think that's openoffice.apache.org

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:58,640
and then we have openoffice.org where

00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,640
more the user content is

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,919
both web pages together

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,919
is something in the

00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:13,039
in the gigabyte range on on data

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,960
they use an old cms system which needs

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,840
to be

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,840
migrated

00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:23,679
[Music]

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,919
and not every every page

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,840
that there is is really outdated there's

00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,880
a lot of

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:32,960
information but there's also

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,000
content that is hopelessly outdated or

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,860
useless yeah

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,039
i mean

00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:40,720
[Music]

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:43,360
you can search a lot in total

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,120
there's another talk on this i can

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,159
recommend

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,799
open office on the web david will talk

00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,760
about

00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,720
our web infrastructure a little bit more

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,640
and i hope

00:32:52,720 --> 00:33:00,240
this interests some people

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,480
yeah yeah

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,919
this is what i could gather for a little

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,880
bit i can

00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,880
um maybe talk with you a little bit time

00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:13,919
if there is

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:17,279
um we will i think what we can

00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:22,399
hold up is

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:26,320
that we can uh that we will stay around

00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:30,000
that people who are on the project um

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:33,200
are returning not always

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,399
online not always active but they're
