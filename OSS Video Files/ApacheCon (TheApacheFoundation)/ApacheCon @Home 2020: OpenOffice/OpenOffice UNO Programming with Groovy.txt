	OpenOffice UNO Programming with Groovy
Carl Marcum

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

The talk will discuss using the Apache Groovy programming language with Apache OpenOffice UNO API's and some associated projects that allow this to happen. Projects include the Groovy UNO Extension that adds convenience methods to the OpenOffice API's allowing less coding, an OpenOffice Extension that adds Groovy as a macro language to the office, and an associated extension to add sample macros to the office written in Groovy. Examples of usages like Groovy scripts as OpenOffice client applications, OpenOffice macros in Groovy, and a compiled OpenOffice extension application in Groovy.
