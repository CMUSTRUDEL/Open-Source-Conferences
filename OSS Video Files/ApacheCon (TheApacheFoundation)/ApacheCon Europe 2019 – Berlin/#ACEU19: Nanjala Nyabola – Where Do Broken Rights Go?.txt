Description: 
	Full title: Where do Broken Rights Go? A View from the Global South on the Limits of Techno-solutionism
More: https://aceu19.apachecon.com/session/where-do-broken-rights-go-view-global-south-limits-techno-solutionism

After years of nearly unchecked tech-optimism, the world is finally waking up to the human rights challenges created by the collision between technology and society around the world. No longer are the promises of a tech-based future going unchecked as experts and laymen increasingly interrogate the agendas and motives of those who hold technology up as the be-all and end-all solution to complex social problems. Technology presents opportunities but also has limits, and it is apparent that what looks great at the centre can be devastating at the periphery.

This presentation will highlight some of the human rights challenges presented by embracing techno-solutionism – throwing technology at complex problems without examining the social and political structures of the societies in which it is deployed. Three contemporary debates will be highlighted: identity systems, electoral systems and fintech systems as currently deployed in countries in the global south. By juxtaposing their promises, what they delivered and what human rights challenges they raise, this talk will re-emphasise the importance of re-centering the political in deciding the role that technology will play in our political systems in future.

as you've heard my name is nan Jolla and

00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:19,460
I'm here to talk to you about rights and

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,829
you heard you know it's probably very

00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,439
strange to be talking about rights in a

00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:28,189
tech conference but it's becoming less

00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:34,730
and less strange yesterday in my country

00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:38,440
there was a case in the courtroom I'm

00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:46,000
told my right earring is making a party

00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:46,000
without me a little bit weird but ok

00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,260
yesterday in my country Kenya there was

00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,179
a big court case that's being heard it

00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,760
was brought by the bloggers Association

00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:57,620
of Kenya and they're basically suing the

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,749
government because the government wants

00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,510
to control what people can and cannot

00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:05,990
say on the Internet

00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:08,000
it's the first time that the government

00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:10,490
has been taken to court for legislation

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,130
that has to do with the internet and

00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:16,970
technology in general in the last five

00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:18,440
years we are also in the middle of

00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,740
congressional hearings that you saw yet

00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,940
you probably saw yesterday Facebook

00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,910
congressional hearings about their new

00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:28,490
cryptocurrency but the focus of the

00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:30,680
questions was broadly on how Facebook

00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,510
has impacted the way we do politics the

00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,760
way Americans think about politics and

00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,110
practice politics and so the

00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,460
conversation and the intersection

00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,610
between rights and technology is

00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,830
becoming much more urgent and my concern

00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,870
is an analyst is do we actually have the

00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:47,480
right analytical tools to process what's

00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:50,030
happening are we on the same page about

00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,490
what rights mean and why they matter

00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,530
are we moving in the same direction as

00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,960
we build things as we develop things as

00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,190
we share our new technologies as we move

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,030
it are we moving in the same direction

00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:04,310
or are we pulling apart and these

00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,050
questions came have become important to

00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,110
me as a political analyst because I've

00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:11,180
seen firsthand what happens when people

00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,900
stop paying attention to the human

00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:17,900
dimension and to the rights dimension of

00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,350
Technology and its use of course the big

00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,180
quest

00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:24,050
that we are all still struggling is with

00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:26,840
is Myanmar was the internet responsible

00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,880
for a genocide in Myanmar was access to

00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,430
the Internet a reason why this genocide

00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,800
happened there is no simple answer

00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:36,350
people are still parsing through the

00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,050
facts and parsing through the historical

00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:42,260
arc but closer to home in my country

00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:44,360
Kenya the introduction of the incident

00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,820
has had effects that I would broadly

00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:50,480
summarize as the good the bad and the

00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:53,600
ugly the good news is freedom of

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,940
expression freedom of association

00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,070
people are telling stories and existing

00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,260
in a way that under especially under the

00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:04,340
authoritarian regime was increasingly

00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:06,650
impossible the bad news is people are

00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,930
using the internet for abuse people are

00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,370
using the internet to spread hate people

00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:13,340
are using the Internet to manipulate

00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:15,260
political processes and the really ugly

00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,260
stuff the stuff that we saw in the

00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:21,380
election in 2017 is stuff that leads to

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,780
widespread death and destruction when

00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,940
foreign companies when capital foreign

00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:29,060
capital interferes with political

00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,200
processes and people die just so that

00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,880
people on the other half way on the

00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,370
other side of the world can make a quick

00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,320
buck so what I'm going to talk to you

00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,390
about today is some of these factors and

00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,800
yes I was listening to Whitney Houston

00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:43,480
when I came up with the title of this

00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:46,370
talk if you don't know the reference I

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,520
don't know how to help you

00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:51,470
and I'm just going to give you a view of

00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,230
what these conversations look like for

00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:56,180
us in Kenya today and hopefully leave

00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,250
you with a starting point as you go back

00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,980
to your own careers as you go back to

00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:03,110
your own countries maybe start asking

00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,970
different questions maybe to start

00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,490
interrogating things at a point that

00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:09,710
hadn't really occurred to you before and

00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:11,240
I'm using Kenyan as an example because

00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:13,550
that's the country that I've studied the

00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,410
most but a lot of the lessons that you

00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:17,090
see here and a lot of the questions that

00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,820
I'm hoping that I'm raising here for you

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:22,160
are things that apply not just in Africa

00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,930
but really around the world and things

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,840
that we're all going to have to start

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:29,440
thinking very systematically about over

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,440
the next five years

00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:40,110
what is tech no solution ISM tech no

00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:43,920
solution ISM is the idea or the belief

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:47,400
that every problem has a solution based

00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,710
on technology but if we just throw tech

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,020
at some of these complex social and

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,890
political problems that everything is

00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,650
just going to work out okay

00:04:54,890 --> 00:05:00,810
techno solution ISM is rooted in the

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:03,720
financial and the perceived financial

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,700
success or material success of using the

00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,450
Internet to solve communications

00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:11,010
challenges nobody will ever argue with

00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,900
the fact that the Internet has solved

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,220
many of the communications challenges

00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,070
that we were facing in the previous

00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,390
decades nobody will ever ever say that

00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,670
the Internet has not made it easier for

00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,830
us to connect across boundaries to

00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:25,080
connect across borders to build new

00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,150
communities to tell stories that were

00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,590
difficult to tell before no one will

00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:35,180
ever argue that point the question is

00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:35,180
can the internet do the same for

00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:42,210
anti-discrimination work can it do the

00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:45,090
same for political rights can I do the

00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:46,710
same for economic rights there are many

00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,740
people in the world today who are

00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:52,890
advancing this argument and they're

00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,500
advancing this argument uncritically are

00:05:52,890 --> 00:06:00,270
we going to solve these problems by

00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:01,830
throwing technology at them of course

00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,330
the narrative is mostly driven by the

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,860
people who develop the technology and

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,400
technology is presented at this neutral

00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:12,300
good we just nothing's changing we're

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:15,390
just adding technology to the mix but if

00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,740
we start to interrogate the inequalities

00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:19,820
that are embedded in that conversation

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:23,160
I'll give you a quick example refugees

00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,990
Kenya was at one time had the two of the

00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,050
largest refugee camps in the world

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:30,600
Dada refugee camp at its peak had over

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,430
half a million people if it were a town

00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,720
if it were allowed to exist as a town in

00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,660
Kenya it would have been the third

00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,550
largest city in the country but of

00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,919
course because of the politics behind

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:43,479
refugees the government did not

00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:47,689
acknowledge the job as a town

00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:49,999
right now there are so many nonprofits

00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:52,639
that are trying to use technology to

00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:55,369
manage refugee populations people are

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,899
being essentially branded you get a bar

00:06:55,369 --> 00:07:00,080
code that makes it possible for you to

00:06:56,899 --> 00:07:01,909
get food to get shelter to get water and

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,159
if you don't have the right bar code you

00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:06,919
can access the right information you can

00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:08,629
access the right services sorry and we

00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:10,429
had an incident at the beginning of this

00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:12,830
year where the government was trying to

00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:15,769
introduce a new tech based ID system and

00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:17,209
the refugees were so frustrated and fed

00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,279
up with having to register with all

00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:22,339
these multiple systems that many people

00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:25,729
chose to go back to conflict zones said

00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:27,769
enough I cannot be registered anymore my

00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:30,319
problem is not being registered my

00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:33,679
problem is that I can't get food I can't

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,599
get water I can't get safety these are

00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:38,059
some of the limits of the discourse

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,679
around techno solution ism but we have a

00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:41,869
lot of service providers who are telling

00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:45,319
themselves that the problem is the tech

00:07:41,869 --> 00:07:47,869
when really the problem is the politics

00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:50,240
and what we're using with doing with

00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:52,579
technology is we're delaying we're

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,729
deferring the more difficult and the

00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:57,889
more complex questions it's an approach

00:07:55,729 --> 00:08:00,469
that often ignores society and politics

00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:03,860
and focuses on producing things that are

00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:09,499
technically good but socially and

00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:12,009
politically constrained so why Kenya

00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:16,009
it's not just because I'm from there

00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:20,539
Kenya is an unusual case it's not the

00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:23,869
most anything as far as Africa is

00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:27,019
concerned it's not the biggest nigeria

00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:30,169
has this beat on population Algeria has

00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:34,009
this beat on sighs it's not the richest

00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:35,569
it's not got the most oil it's not got

00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:37,759
the most we don't even have the most

00:08:35,569 --> 00:08:41,719
elephants and we have a lot of elephants

00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:43,339
we're very proud of that and yet how

00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,180
does a country that's not the most

00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:49,009
anything become the regional leader in

00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:51,139
mobile money global leader in facts in

00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:53,300
mobile money Kenya has the most

00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:56,360
transactions per capita for mobile money

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:58,100
in 2016 and since then

00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,320
actions conducted on mobile money have

00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:03,589
been amounted to the equivalent of one

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,170
third of the country's GDP we have some

00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:08,540
of the fastest internet in the world we

00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:11,779
have some of the best connected towns

00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:14,660
urban areas in Africa how does that

00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:18,200
happen a lot of it has to do with

00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:20,810
society a highly educated outward-facing

00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,410
society while connected to the latest

00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:26,180
developments by 2002 they were 2.6

00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,800
million Kenyans living abroad which at

00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,050
the time was 10 percent of the country's

00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,940
population most of those are what we

00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:34,390
would call highly educated people who

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:37,730
had a high school diploma and above

00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:39,050
these are people who are communicating

00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,880
and keeping the people who are within

00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:44,120
the country connected to what's

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,040
happening around the world you launch a

00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,600
new phone in California today and in

00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,570
next week there will be about 10,000

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,510
Kenyans who have tried to get it we are

00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:55,100
very much on the cusp of what is being

00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:58,430
developed and what is being rolled out

00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:00,699
around the world for better or worse we

00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:03,320
are an easily accessible society in

00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:04,430
social sciences we would probably Kenya

00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,860
would probably be called an over

00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,089
research society wherever people think

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,310
they want to roll out something new

00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:12,320
we've right now in the debate about

00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:15,860
randomized control trials donuts you

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,630
seen this debate around our cities most

00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,510
of the research that won the Nobel was

00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:22,190
done in Kenya where a society that is

00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,519
because a lot of people speak English

00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:27,140
it's very easy to fly in or out

00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:29,089
researchers love to social science

00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:32,680
researchers Tech Research has loved to

00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:35,480
roll out their work in Kenya in the

00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,370
first five years of tech the government

00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,870
policy in Kenya was very much about

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,980
enabling when the internet was

00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,720
introduced into the country

00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,630
it was very much about creating an

00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:48,339
enabling environment for tech was very

00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:50,769
much about opening up to connectivity

00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:53,329
allowing companies to come and open

00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:56,690
their Africa branches into the country

00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:58,579
this was the first five years over the

00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,560
last 10 years what we've seen is the

00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:02,480
opposite it's now that the government

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,550
sees that the Internet can be a threat

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,529
to their political power we're seeing a

00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:09,050
lot more legislation being passed to car

00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:10,250
sale especially freedom of speech

00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:12,950
and remember as I mentioned at the top

00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,600
people keep going to court and people

00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:18,500
people keep having to fight these

00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,240
battles because unlike here where a tech

00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,550
company would position itself as an

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,110
agent of free speech because of the

00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,089
interests of capital in a lot of the

00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:28,910
developing world tech companies often

00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:31,730
align themselves with power so we don't

00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:33,829
have the same momentum for supporting

00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:36,380
litigation Bakke is the bloggers

00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:38,089
association of Kenya and they are the

00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,120
people who have been taking the

00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:43,579
government to court time and time again

00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:47,570
while the global leaders of corporations

00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:50,180
like Facebook like Google yeah I said it

00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:52,940
will come to Kenya and have photo ops

00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:55,910
with the Minister for ICT that's the

00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:58,399
power dynamic and as a result Kenya has

00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:00,800
become a petri dish for almost unchecked

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,620
experimentation and it makes me very

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,320
uncomfortable as a Kenyan to say that

00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,910
but it's the uncomfortable truth people

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,380
come with their half-baked initiatives

00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,690
and their half-baked ideas and the

00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:14,810
brainstorm that they hit hey what if we

00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:21,440
used cryptocurrency to solve access to

00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:23,060
HPV vaccinations okay is really the

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,740
problem the fact that there is no

00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,779
cryptocurrency or the fact that there is

00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,390
social pushback against giving young

00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:32,300
girls HPV vaccinations

00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:33,800
how will cryptocurrency fix that and if

00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,540
I made a list of all the things that

00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,700
people have pitched crisp cryptocurrency

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:44,089
to fix in Kenya in the last five years

00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:45,770
it would actually blow your mind this is

00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:49,760
just a brief digital profile of where

00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:51,320
Kenya is out of a population of 48

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,610
million as of the last census we're

00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:57,079
waiting for the results of the current

00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:59,360
sentence census 25 million or just over

00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:01,730
half have access to the Internet and

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,310
about 18 million are using the internet

00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:07,190
every day there are 20 million

00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:10,360
smartphones in the country and about 10

00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:12,470
million people who are using computers

00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:16,279
the average number of connected devices

00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:19,040
per person so this is incredible for a

00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:22,279
developing country for a country that is

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,079
at least 60% rural these are incredible

00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:27,620
statistics

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:31,339
and this is how social media for example

00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:34,980
as of 2015

00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:37,949
2017 sorry 12 million on whatsapp and

00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,810
growing everyday and I tell you Facebook

00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:41,220
7.1 million that lead might look at that

00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:43,260
and think that doesn't sound like a very

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,730
big number but considering that two

00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,170
years before that the number was 5

00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:48,209
million which means if you had 2 point 1

00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:50,310
million new accounts over a two year

00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:51,810
period it gives you a sense of the

00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:54,750
trajectory at which social media is

00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:57,180
being taken up the connection between

00:13:54,750 --> 00:14:00,690
tech and politics in Kenya is very stark

00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:03,120
and is embedded in the way in which we

00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:06,630
do our politics we have the second fully

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:10,170
digital election in Africa in 2017 and

00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:12,839
that was because in 2007 after we had

00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:14,670
our post-election violence one of the

00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,220
Commission's of inquiry that was brought

00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:20,070
together to resolve that battle said if

00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:23,070
we just use technology to solve the

00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:25,529
trust issue then people will stop going

00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:29,670
out in the streets to fight each other

00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:33,240
if we just throw tech at 20 years of

00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:35,730
political complexity and 20 years of

00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:41,040
political push and pull everything's

00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:43,050
going to be ok so what I'm gonna do is

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm gonna give you three broad

00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:47,639
situations that we're facing in Kenya

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,920
right now and the promise of tech in

00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,899
this context and the challenges that

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,880
we've faced and the outstanding

00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:57,180
questions that we're still trying to

00:14:53,880 --> 00:15:00,870
answer the first is Isis said identity

00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:03,660
systems it's interesting we're in

00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:06,569
Germany a country that has had very

00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,680
complex experiences with identity and I

00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:09,839
think the Germans in the room would

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,240
probably understand this more than

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,730
people who are operating in a space

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,730
where they assume that everybody s

00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:19,019
honest that the dominant ethnicity is

00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:21,089
everybody's ethnicity in that territory

00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:23,670
I think Germans know better than most

00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:25,680
people how identity can become a focal

00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:28,160
point for conflict and how it can

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,810
destroy and bring a society to its knees

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,390
Kenya is a country that has 44 ethnic

00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:36,300
groups the biggest six ethnic groups are

00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,930
60% of the population our political

00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,059
contestation

00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:42,720
is mostly framed around ethnic

00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:44,339
identities mostly and discrimination

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,339
against people who are seen to be of the

00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:49,410
wrong ethnic group is rife we have the

00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:51,420
Nubian community that was brought in by

00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:54,689
the British administration under the

00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:56,639
colonial period to fight for the British

00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:58,139
colonial government and they were

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,600
promised that they would be given Kenyan

00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:02,730
citizenship at the end of the

00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,110
independence war and of course the

00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:06,929
British Rene turned that promise and

00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:09,779
today they are Nubian people in Kenya

00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:12,179
who cannot get ID cards who cannot get

00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:14,040
passports who cannot get their Kenyan

00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:16,860
said even though they are third fourth

00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:20,939
generation born and raised in Nairobi

00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:23,220
the capital city the complete embrace of

00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:25,949
digital governance in 2013 made the

00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:28,189
internet a central pillar of how they

00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:30,540
were administration was going to govern

00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:32,579
right now in Kenya we have a digital

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,980
platform for taxation collection.i tax

00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:36,329
with a digital platform for government

00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,790
procurement and managing government

00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:40,619
contracts if Miss licensing and

00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:43,889
registration of vehicles is done by tims

00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:45,540
and the NTSA identity systems in general

00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:47,579
I managed through the e citizen platform

00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,920
if you do not have access to the

00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:52,920
Internet in Kenya it is almost

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:56,670
impossible to manage your life as an

00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:58,769
adult and the promotion of digital

00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:01,110
identities and especially the single

00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:02,269
digital identities with financing and

00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,439
support from international organizations

00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:07,319
has come into the rubric of what is

00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:09,480
called good ID and the idea is that if

00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:13,140
we can just get an ID system that is

00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,490
technically good then people are going

00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,130
to be able to access all of these

00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:19,890
services now I'm sure there people from

00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,709
India in the audience here and India has

00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:24,179
had an interesting experience with this

00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:26,010
because we're actually borrowing keep

00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,209
peeking over the the Indian Ocean and

00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:29,820
seeing or what are those guys doing

00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:31,200
we're gonna do that too and of course

00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,789
you know that the other system as has

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,549
been rolled out in India has actually

00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:38,220
led to a significant crisis for

00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:40,830
religious minorities and for a lot of

00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,480
ethnic minorities and poor people who

00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:44,970
have been denied access to the digital

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,919
platform for reasons that are beyond the

00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,870
scope of the technical goodness of the

00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:49,580
system

00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,900
if you're a farmer and you've been

00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,140
working the farm since you were eight

00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,820
years old weaving you know digging

00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,740
digging digging the ground every day for

00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:00,620
hours an end and you happen to not have

00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,929
fingerprints and the system and your

00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,610
unique digital identity is based on your

00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:07,669
ability to register with your

00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:10,909
fingerprints how is tech going to solve

00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:15,350
that problem wasn't thought about before

00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:17,450
the other system was rolled out in Kenya

00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:19,669
the equivalent of an her is called a

00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:22,640
human number it was rolled out in

00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:25,309
February of this year under threats and

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,570
coercion we were told if you didn't get

00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:28,789
a whole German number you could not get

00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:30,559
a new passport your mobile money account

00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:32,840
will be shut down you will not have

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,460
access to an ID card you will not have

00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,529
access then one thing that they said

00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,179
that everybody said don't threaten me

00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:41,659
the good time was you wouldn't be able

00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:47,330
to pay taxes said oh that doesn't sound

00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:49,279
like a bad thing um everybody over the

00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:51,080
age of six whether they were citizens or

00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,360
non-citizens was required to register

00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,330
and many were being compelled to

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,070
register at embassies abroad now the

00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:00,559
promise of tech here was that it would

00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:03,110
streamline the identity conversation in

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:05,860
Kenya it would enhance government

00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:08,779
provision but we were not told how and

00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,760
the presumption as I said was that the

00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:13,820
reason why people were not getting IDs

00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:16,850
or using IDs was because the system was

00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:18,770
technically flawed but the reality is

00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:20,899
that there are many ethnic groups in

00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:24,039
Kenya who are denied access to identity

00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:26,510
systems because of the political issue

00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:29,330
I'm from an ethnic group that's on the

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:30,710
border with Kenya statistically we are

00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:33,919
the second largest ethnic group in the

00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:36,460
country but it's complicated I had to

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,230
wait for years to get my ID card because

00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,640
I refused I was born and raised in

00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:42,980
Nairobi and they would not let me

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,080
register in Arabi because if I register

00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:48,020
in Nairobi the odds are I'm going to be

00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,429
an opposition voter whereas if I'm

00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:53,179
forced to go register in the village

00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:54,380
then my vote becomes one in many and it

00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:57,470
doesn't make a difference in the overall

00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:59,960
political conversation Somali Kenyans

00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:00,830
are routinely denied ID cards and told

00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,899
because

00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:06,200
our Somali you don't belong here you

00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:08,179
need to go back one of my earliest

00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,769
interns she was Somali Kenyan could not

00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:12,679
get a bank account because she was

00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:15,049
denied an ID card because she was told

00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:17,659
she had to go and be vetted by a chief

00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:20,000
in a village in rural northern Kenya

00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:24,289
that she had never met and never seen

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:28,010
the word of her supervisor myself her

00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:30,320
friends in the city was not enough that

00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:34,100
has nothing to do with technology it has

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,230
everything to do with politics the

00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,690
reality the human number system is

00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,760
poorly thought-out it regularly rolled

00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:43,039
out it doesn't under a dress the

00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,830
underlying politics of discrimination it

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,870
does not address the reason why people

00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:50,059
don't and people who have every reason

00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:53,090
to get an ID card don't get ID cards

00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:56,179
because our ID system was developed by

00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:59,659
the British colonial government in 1919

00:20:56,179 --> 00:21:01,820
as a means of coercion and humiliation

00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:04,070
and there are many people who still

00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:10,519
resist that because we've never changed

00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:12,110
the system the whole process was

00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,659
characterized by threats and

00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:16,789
intimidation unconstitutional

00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:20,000
proclamations that only increase the

00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:21,590
resistance to it and I have to emphasize

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,330
this because the people who are who are

00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,919
pushing for the rollout of the hajima

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:27,380
number system a lot of them are people

00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:29,840
who work for big multinational

00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:31,639
corporations are people who are going to

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,950
make money from this system when its

00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:35,500
rolled out our development organizations

00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:37,970
that are trying to push a narrative that

00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,260
the reason why the developing world is

00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:42,139
struggling is because we don't have

00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:44,120
enough data one of my close friends an

00:21:42,139 --> 00:21:45,350
NGO who is not nan Jala I have to say

00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,580
that a lot because people get us mixed

00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:48,649
up

00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:51,590
she always says what makes you think

00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:53,090
that a government that hasn't given a

00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,100
lick about what people have been doing

00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:57,380
or not doing for the last 50 years is

00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:00,340
suddenly going to wake up and do better

00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:02,659
just because they have more numbers

00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,850
these are some of the more complex

00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:08,960
questions that have been raised by this

00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:11,179
system the second as I mentioned is

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,370
electoral systems now I'm trying to

00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:14,659
compress over 56 years of history into

00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,460
three bullet points

00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:18,739
so you'll have to forgive me if nothing

00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,690
makes complete sense from beginning to

00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:23,239
end

00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:25,249
essentially the 2007 2008 post-election

00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:28,159
violence in Kenya was a culmination of

00:22:25,249 --> 00:22:31,159
many many years of broken electoral

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:34,879
cycles we had election violence in 99 we

00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:38,059
were one-party state from 1963 to 1992

00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:40,609
we had a violent election in 1992 we had

00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:43,489
a violent election 1997 we had a great

00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:45,830
election in 2002 with an almost perfect

00:22:43,489 --> 00:22:49,369
referendum in 2005 and then we had a

00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:50,929
disaster of an election in 2007 it was

00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:53,269
the worst outbreak of citizen-driven

00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:55,399
violence in the country's history over

00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:58,039
1,500 people were killed another hundred

00:22:55,399 --> 00:23:01,309
thousand displaced and the peacemaking

00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:04,309
settlement which had four Commission's

00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:06,349
of inquiry attached to it had one as I

00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:07,789
said that identified low trust in

00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:09,700
elections as a reason why people

00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:13,690
resorted to violence

00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:18,919
we were told more tech in the elections

00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:20,599
everything's gonna run better 2013 was

00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:24,440
the first partially digital election

00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:29,179
where the systems were being tested 2017

00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:36,379
was the first fully digital election the

00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:39,220
farce of 2017 bvr biometric voter

00:23:36,379 --> 00:23:42,470
registration it was the election of

00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:44,720
acronyms so bvr biometric voter

00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:47,479
registration even electronic voter

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,700
identification RTS results transmission

00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:51,259
system basically everything from the

00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,509
moment that you walked into your polling

00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:55,519
station to the day that the results were

00:23:53,509 --> 00:23:58,159
announced was handed over to computer

00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:00,320
systems and this was supposed to make

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,330
things more transparent but what it

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,269
actually did is it made things more

00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:08,090
opaque and this became incredibly

00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:10,249
evident when we had the petition that

00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:13,639
requested the annulment of the election

00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:15,080
results now I'm a recovering lawyer that

00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:16,700
means I have a law degree and I don't

00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:22,309
practice and my mother complains about

00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:24,019
it every two weeks when if anything can

00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:27,750
get me to sit there and watch a supreme

00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:30,000
court proceeding for 36 hours straight

00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:31,920
pretty big deal and I want just about

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,930
every single hour of this court

00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,820
proceeding and one thing that became

00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:38,100
obvious to me was that the lawyers did

00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:40,320
not understand what they were talking

00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,360
about they were talking at

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,800
cross-purposes with each other the

00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:48,660
opposition wanted an audit the Electoral

00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,310
Commission said well we can't open the

00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:52,200
servers because the servers are in

00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:54,870
France and the people in France are

00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:58,320
asleep there was a lot of conversation

00:24:54,870 --> 00:25:00,960
and an analogizing of a technical system

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,510
because the one person who had

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,380
understood the system best was murdered

00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:09,930
less than a week before the election

00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:12,330
now when bureaucrats start dying in the

00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:14,630
course of their employment then you know

00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:17,880
that something has gone terribly wrong

00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:20,550
the much-vaunted perfect system was

00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:24,000
slowly falling apart with days to go

00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:25,860
before the election the promise was that

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,700
introducing technology to the electoral

00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:32,340
system would address the trust deficit

00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:35,670
the reality we had no idea what was

00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:39,660
happening we had no idea how to fix it

00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:42,810
and it was becoming dangerous and people

00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:44,760
were dying in the end the Supreme Court

00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:46,680
overturned the results of the August

00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,900
election and called for a second

00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:51,630
election in October and people went out

00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:53,610
and voted voter turnout was suppressed

00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:56,460
and I would argue that today there is

00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:58,380
less faith in the democratic system in

00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,570
Kenya than there was before that

00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,770
election because people have been

00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:04,230
confronted with a system that they

00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:06,870
cannot explain to themselves it's

00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:09,780
technology is a black box into which our

00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:15,240
votes go and out of which chaos comes

00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:18,420
out and finally money money money

00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:21,600
I mentioned off the top early adoption

00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:23,720
of mobile money digitization of

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,830
procurement and government transactions

00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:29,870
rapid uptake of mobile phone-based

00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:32,370
gambling borrowing lending purchasing

00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:34,410
today if you have a smartphone in Kenya

00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:36,450
you almost don't need a computer I

00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:38,790
prefer to have a computer but a lot of

00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:40,620
people do much of their lives their

00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:41,710
banking their buying and selling

00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:45,570
borrowing sending

00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:45,570
receiving money on their mobile phones

00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:52,720
in 2015 the auditor-general in Kenya

00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:54,850
said the infamous which is the

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,040
procurement system as neither it means

00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:58,870
integrated financial management

00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,540
information system it's a system that

00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:03,220
was funded by the USAID it's been used

00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,810
in other countries in Romania and

00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,290
Bulgaria it's something that's rolled

00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:10,120
out in developing countries in

00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:12,580
middle-income countries the Auditor

00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,620
General of Kenya said the infamous

00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:17,620
system is neither integrated nor does it

00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:20,620
help me manage anything it has made it

00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:22,570
more difficult for governments officials

00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:24,850
for the auditor to track transactions

00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:26,710
it's made it more difficult for people

00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:30,850
in the public to understand where things

00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:33,910
are going can you cannot account up for

00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:37,120
up to one third of its GDP every year

00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:40,930
since if miss was introduced so

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:44,170
basically we lose a third of what we

00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:49,240
produce every year and nobody can

00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:50,890
adequately accurately explain why the

00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:54,070
lack of transparency transparency and

00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:56,730
accountability has become intensified

00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:58,840
because people blame it on the system I

00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:01,210
didn't do anything wrong oh I just

00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:04,750
entered the wrong email account that guy

00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:06,880
got my email password and he fiddled

00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:09,190
around and that's why this thing doesn't

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,890
make sense it's not me it's a computer

00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:13,990
glitch it's a computer error this is the

00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:16,680
discourse around financial

00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:19,690
accountability in the government today

00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:22,270
we talk about mobile money and mobile

00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:27,400
lending and in principle it's a

00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:30,190
wonderful idea by 2006 one m-pesa when

00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:33,340
mobile money was first launched only 27%

00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:35,410
of Kenyan adults had access to a back if

00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:38,530
you could not maintain a minimum balance

00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:41,620
of 50 thousand shillings which at the

00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:43,540
time was the equivalent of about 300-400

00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:45,550
dollars if you could not maintain a

00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:47,860
minimum balance of five 300-400 dollars

00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:50,230
every month you could not keep a bank

00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:53,560
account keep in mind that the minimum

00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:54,940
wage in Kenya is 50 dollars who in it

00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,160
was able to maintain

00:28:54,940 --> 00:29:00,970
account keep that money and have it just

00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:05,020
sit in the bank every day for 12 months

00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:07,590
a year very few people you could not

00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:09,700
transact the bank's had us by the necks

00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:11,620
you couldn't send or receive money

00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,660
without paying a premium on the top of

00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:15,670
it if you will drew your own money from

00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:18,820
the bank he would have a $2.00 fee for

00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:21,160
each transaction the bank's really did

00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:24,700
have us and so the mobile money really

00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:26,770
has helped but up to a limit because now

00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:30,040
we're seeing the inverse now the mobile

00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:32,530
money companies have us by the neck the

00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:35,710
rates at which poor people are accessing

00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:37,690
money are disproportionately high it is

00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:39,880
cheaper for a wealthy person to have

00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:41,620
money in Kenya than it is for a poor

00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,570
person to have who's especially one

00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:47,110
who's reliant on Mobile Money to have

00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:49,150
money in Kenya the fine print and mobile

00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:51,460
money is that the rates would be

00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:57,070
unacceptable if they were in any other

00:29:51,460 --> 00:30:01,030
context 34% APR to borrow money is

00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:04,050
insane and yet this is what people are

00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:06,160
dealing with time and time again and

00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:09,280
underlying all of that is an ethics

00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:12,280
question when the company that's doing

00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:14,020
the most transactions is a company that

00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:16,780
is thirty five percent owned by the

00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:20,620
government and the government says you

00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:24,010
can't pay for services at a government

00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:26,740
office using any other service and you

00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:30,070
any other platform and you cannot use

00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:31,150
cash I remember when I first went back

00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:33,700
to Kenya I tried to renew my driver's

00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:35,050
license I don't use mobile money and I

00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,920
try to review my driver's license they

00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:39,720
wouldn't take my money

00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:42,670
I said that's illegal it's legal tender

00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:45,460
protected by law you cannot reject my

00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:48,670
cash said no that's our policy

00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:50,230
what are the ethics behind that what are

00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:53,140
the ethics behind the policy maker

00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:55,030
making money from the policy decisions

00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:58,480
and the power dynamics that are embedded

00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:59,950
in that these are some of the tough

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:04,110
questions that we have to ask ourselves

00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:07,120
about mobile money are we actually just

00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:08,740
promoting systems and platforms and and

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,790
this has to do it all so Finn

00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,710
and all of these new phonetic

00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:13,270
developments are we actually just

00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:16,240
promoting platforms that make it more

00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:19,510
expensive to be poor that poor people

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,510
are having to spend more to get money to

00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:24,190
use money to spend money than wealthy

00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:26,980
people who can opt out because their

00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:35,440
cash their credit cards will always be

00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:38,190
accepted what tech breaks to me I think

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,630
the Internet is a wonderful thing I

00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:43,630
think of all of the ways in which it has

00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:46,000
shaped my career my professional life

00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:47,850
the people it's brought into my life the

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,510
communities that I've been able to build

00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:54,820
I'm a huge nerd a huge nerd to be able

00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:56,980
to find other huge nerds and go online

00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:59,710
and have long conversations about

00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:01,900
obscure technical things has been the

00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:04,510
highlights of the last 10 years of my

00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,830
life but I have to acknowledge that the

00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:09,420
changes that are being introduced into

00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:12,820
the ecosystem are not simply that linear

00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:15,400
more tech doesn't always make things

00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:18,580
better sometimes it makes things

00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:21,090
complicated and especially so for the

00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:24,190
most vulnerable people in our societies

00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:26,679
Tech is an amplifier the Internet is an

00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:28,750
amplifier it will amplify whatever it

00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:31,120
finds in the society in which it is

00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:33,400
introduced and that's why to me it's so

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,500
important to understand societies as

00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,990
well as to understand the technology

00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:40,059
that's why to me it's so important to

00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:43,780
understand how the cleavages that have

00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:45,790
come before will be intensified by what

00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:50,230
Internet's what the internet introduces

00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:53,170
into those societies we have to build

00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:55,960
with intentionality I look at what the

00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:58,030
ID conversation has done especially and

00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,429
I've talked to you about the Nubian

00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:02,559
people in Kenya the Nubian people are

00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:05,110
the only people who have sued about the

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,250
homonymous system because they recognize

00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,929
that it will intensify the

00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:10,030
discrimination that they're going to

00:33:07,929 --> 00:33:12,780
live under and the case is still in

00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:15,480
court people who had power people whose

00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:17,740
place in Kenya was never in question

00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,200
just thought well it's just another

00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:21,580
thing that I have to register for but

00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,930
for those of us who have been living on

00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,090
the

00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:25,500
for those of us who have experienced

00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:28,410
firsthand the discrimination that the

00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:30,930
state can inflict upon us using ID

00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:33,150
systems what the internet-based system

00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:35,070
threatened was an intensification of

00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:36,870
that people were being asked to pay

00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:39,120
bribes before being allowed to access

00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:40,830
that system but if you're not on the

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,690
system you're gonna lose your mobile

00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:44,940
money account you're gonna lose your

00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:47,150
passport you're gonna lose your driver's

00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,980
license you're gonna not be able to like

00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:51,660
how is that a good thing and how is that

00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,250
not front and center of the conversation

00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:56,940
that's being driven by the people who

00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:58,920
are building the platform's the opacity

00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:02,130
of internet-based systems

00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:04,590
it breaks chains of accountability as I

00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:06,990
said with elections a black box into

00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:09,419
which information is going in voting is

00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:11,880
going in and chaos is coming out and

00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:14,159
today the intellectual commission itself

00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:16,830
has not adequately been able to explain

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:21,030
to Kenyon what it was that was built and

00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:23,520
rolled out in 2017 we're still waiting

00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:25,980
for the final results of that audit and

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:29,100
it's not going to be done but for the

00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:33,810
2022 election I would bet because chaos

00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:37,890
and the ambiguity and the abstraction is

00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:40,530
good for profit and is good for people

00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:42,810
who want to access power Kenya's

00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:46,350
election system was not built by Kenyans

00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:47,460
it was built by a French corporation the

00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:49,200
questions are were asking about

00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,750
manipulation and social media and

00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,120
political identity the risk of ethnic

00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:56,220
violence that came with hate speech and

00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,750
the dissemination of hate speech was

00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,920
being done on platforms that were not

00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,390
being built in Arabi

00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,180
they weren't even being built in

00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:06,300
Johannesburg the question of foreign

00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:08,760
capital coming in to complex political

00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,830
situations without understanding those

00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,990
complex political situations and without

00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:15,240
being accountable for what happens next

00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:17,400
as you can make your money and then

00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:20,730
leave but we have to live with the

00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,890
consequences that's the reality part of

00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:25,140
the reality of what the tech based

00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:31,580
solution ISM has introduced to our

00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:31,580
societies so what does this mean

00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:36,460
I should have said this right at the top

00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:41,380
I'm not a techie I'm a political

00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:44,800
scientist it took many many years for me

00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:47,760
to get a smartphone and a lot of

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,110
emotional blackmail from my former boss

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:55,690
what I want to leave you with is I think

00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:58,570
three principles ideas challenges to sit

00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:00,280
with and think about and hopefully

00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:03,010
integrates into the work that you're

00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,690
doing if there is a perspective from the

00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:06,880
global South that I can bring into this

00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:10,420
room I've tried to condense it into

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:15,870
these three points the first is built

00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:18,430
with intention build with intention just

00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:21,520
because you can build it doesn't mean

00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:25,000
that you should just because you can

00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:27,610
collect a certain types of data doesn't

00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,470
mean that you should just because you

00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:31,240
can build a platform that turns data in

00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:33,670
from one thing into something else

00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:36,250
doesn't mean that you should there was a

00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:39,940
foreign American NGO that came to Kenya

00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:41,890
to collect data on hiv/aids and they

00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,600
went around into the sample a survey and

00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:44,980
they collected all of this private

00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,080
information because we don't have a data

00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:49,900
protection law and they were sitting on

00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:52,330
this database with the private health

00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:55,000
information of hundreds of thousands of

00:36:52,330 --> 00:37:00,370
people and we're thinking about turning

00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:02,650
it into an opportunity to sell hiv/aids

00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:05,770
medication or to promote I shouldn't say

00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:08,980
sell promotes a certain type of hiv/aids

00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:10,990
medication the one looks very different

00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:14,140
when your central reference object is

00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:15,040
not a white Western man what does your

00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,840
internet-based

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,780
tech look like when you shift your

00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:21,370
central reference object what does it

00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:24,970
look like when the person in the middle

00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:27,490
of the system that you're promoting is a

00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:31,470
person who is were dealing with layers

00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:35,920
of vulnerability build with perspective

00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:37,510
learn from history learn from others the

00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,430
intent is not the only tack that has

00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:42,010
fundamentally altered human behavior

00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:44,079
from a communications perspective I

00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:47,079
always think about the Gutenberg press

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,489
and how monks were freaked out about the

00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:49,989
Gutenberg press because it meant that

00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:52,390
ordinary people would suddenly be able

00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:53,979
to read and if they're able to read it

00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:55,869
means they can challenge it means they

00:37:53,979 --> 00:37:56,979
can question what we're teaching them so

00:37:55,869 --> 00:38:00,759
you had the Luddites going around

00:37:56,979 --> 00:38:02,200
destroying printing presses television

00:38:00,759 --> 00:38:03,640
one inch was introduced there was a huge

00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,900
moral panic in the United States and

00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:07,479
they said well it's gonna make

00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:09,279
housewives stop cooking and kids are

00:38:07,479 --> 00:38:10,359
going to have learn all kinds of things

00:38:09,279 --> 00:38:12,249
that they shouldn't be learning because

00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:14,670
it's too early for them to be learning

00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:17,109
them from a communications perspective

00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:19,089
every iteration of Technology brings

00:38:17,109 --> 00:38:22,359
with it anxieties and brings with it

00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:24,849
uncertainties but what is good from this

00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:26,829
and uncertainty is if people sit and

00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:28,660
lean to the discomfort of that

00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:31,269
disruption and ask themselves the

00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:33,249
complex political questions yeah we

00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:35,229
introduced the printing press it made it

00:38:33,249 --> 00:38:38,140
easier for us to spread and disseminate

00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:40,900
rumors people were producing all kinds

00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:43,509
of really questionable leaflets and then

00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,640
we came together and asked questions and

00:38:43,509 --> 00:38:48,729
said well actually what if we developed

00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:51,130
standards collective standards about

00:38:48,729 --> 00:38:52,949
what people are able to print and what

00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:55,749
people are able to say about each other

00:38:52,949 --> 00:38:57,729
what if the newspapers in the 9th early

00:38:55,749 --> 00:39:00,039
1900s the newspapers came together and

00:38:57,729 --> 00:39:02,979
said well what if we actually developed

00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:05,440
codes of conduct to govern our behavior

00:39:02,979 --> 00:39:07,719
same thing with television same thing

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,119
with radio this is the moment that we're

00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:13,289
in right now with the internet it's

00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:15,519
uncomfortable it's unpleasant it's

00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:17,859
bringing in things that maybe we're not

00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,930
ready to process but we have to lean

00:39:17,859 --> 00:39:21,880
into that discomfort and learn from

00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:23,859
history how did we resolve these

00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,299
anxieties in the past and how can we

00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:27,160
resolve them for the benefit of

00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:32,009
everybody who has to share this planet

00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:35,469
and finally build for inclusion

00:39:32,009 --> 00:39:37,150
understand politics and society and I'm

00:39:35,469 --> 00:39:42,699
not just saying that because I find that

00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:45,489
incredibly interesting ultimately the

00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:47,949
internet tech has shaped both by the

00:39:45,489 --> 00:39:51,039
people who build it and the people who

00:39:47,949 --> 00:39:53,979
use it and we have to understand how

00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:56,270
people work and how society works it's

00:39:53,979 --> 00:39:59,660
not enough to have a technique

00:39:56,270 --> 00:40:01,610
sound and complete platform that

00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:03,830
platform will be used by human beings

00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:06,700
it's important to understand how human

00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:08,600
beings think and how human beings behave

00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,760
this is the challenge that we're facing

00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:13,550
right now as I said this is the moment

00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:15,920
that we're in right now I don't think

00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:17,360
it's enough to stop at well we have to

00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,670
get rid of all of the platforms because

00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,900
people are going to want to communicate

00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:22,400
people are going to want to build things

00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,930
people are going to want to collect data

00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,300
people are going to want to do things

00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:27,920
the more difficult question and the more

00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,860
nuanced questions to me comes from an

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,680
understanding of society and of human

00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:37,390
behavior and so I will challenge you to

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:40,010
explore to understand to try and process

00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:43,280
human behavior to enhance the toolbox

00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:45,980
that you have ahead of you as you build

00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,890
and as you move forward thank you for

00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:54,229
your time

00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:54,229
