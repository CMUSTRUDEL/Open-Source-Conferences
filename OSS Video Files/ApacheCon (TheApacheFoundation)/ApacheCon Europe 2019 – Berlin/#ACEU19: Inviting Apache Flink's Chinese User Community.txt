The role of China in the world is changing: From the workbench of the world to the second biggest economy and a technology and innovation powerhouse. This economic and demographic growth also shows in open source communities like Apache Flink. Today, most of the traffic to the Flink website is coming from China, and most new community members come from this most populous country in the world.

Many well-known online services and communities in the “Western world” have a Chinese equivalent, as for instance Amazon and Alibaba, Google and Baidu, WeChat and Facebook. After the Flink community learned of the existence of a huge, but from our eyes hidden community of thousands of Chinese Flink users, we started offering resources specifically for Chinese-speaking Flink users with the goal to invite these users to join the Apache Flink community.

In this talk, we share our experience inviting and embracing our China-based community. Our efforts include a Chinese-speaking user mailing list or translating the Flink website and documentation. Moreover, we report on ongoing challenges and our future plans to strengthen the ties in our community.
