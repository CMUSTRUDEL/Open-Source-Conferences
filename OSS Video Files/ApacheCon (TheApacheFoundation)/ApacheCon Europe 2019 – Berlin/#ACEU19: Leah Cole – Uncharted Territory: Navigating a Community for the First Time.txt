Title: #ACEU19: Leah Cole – Uncharted Territory: Navigating a Community for the First Time
Publication date: 2019-11-01
Playlist: ApacheCon Europe 2019 – Berlin
Description: 
	More: https://aceu19.apachecon.com/session/uncharted-territory-navigating-community-first-time

Getting involved with an OSS community for the first time can be daunting. Taking time to analyze an OSS community can make that involvement more approachable, and ultimately results in more meaningful contributions to the community. Leah will walk through Google's involvement with Apache Airflow, the process she took to learn about the project and its community, and how you can use this process when getting started with any OSS community.

hi everyone I'm Lia and I am NOT going

00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:14,059
to talk at all about cities although I

00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:16,010
do like cities as Merle said I'm going

00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:18,020
to talk about what it's like to navigate

00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,699
an open-source community for the first

00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,890
time what to do when you're going

00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:24,610
somewhere you've never been before when

00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:27,200
you are in uncharted territory

00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:29,000
alright we're gonna move a little you

00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,039
don't have to stand up but I do want to

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,719
see some hands how many of you have been

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,670
involved with the Apache community for

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,710
more than 10 years raise your hand

00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:40,910
sweet you can put them down alright more

00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:44,480
than five cool more than one how about

00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:46,430
less than one sweet me too

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,899
I'm glad to see such variety in the room

00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:50,360
make sure you noticed who said what

00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:54,050
hands talk to them learn some stuff so

00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:56,210
hi I'm Lea I am new to open source into

00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,399
the Apache community and with the Apache

00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:01,130
community in general I work with air

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,530
flow the reason why I am involved with

00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,810
air flow is because I work at Google I

00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,759
work in developer relations and I

00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:10,579
specifically work on Google Cloud

00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:13,819
Composer which is hosted managed Apache

00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:17,959
airflow I only started at Google in

00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:20,119
November of 2018 and at that time I was

00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:22,700
just a casual consumer of open-source

00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:25,369
when I was at GE everything that I built

00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:28,279
was proprietary so I didn't have any

00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:30,529
experience contributing as for the

00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:32,659
Apache Software Foundation I was pretty

00:01:30,529 --> 00:01:35,149
sure I'd heard of it and at that point

00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:38,979
the only thing I knew about air flow is

00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:41,749
that it meant wind but my new employer

00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:45,380
turned out was the total opposite they

00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:47,719
are a consumer producer contributor to

00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,929
open source they love the Apache

00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:52,939
Software Foundation and some Apache

00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:55,340
projects like air flow are really

00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:58,130
crucial to their cloud product offerings

00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,439
mainly cloud composer but there are some

00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,909
other Apache products that are special

00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,520
to Google too you should talk to me or

00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:06,380
my colleagues about them so when I first

00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:10,069
started I had to figure out what was

00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,819
going on I had no idea everything was an

00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:14,719
unknown

00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:17,329
I had no idea what I didn't know so I

00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:20,090
asked my manager how I should figure

00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:22,450
that out how I should turn my unknown

00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:26,569
unknowns into at least known unknowns

00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:29,720
this very wise manager suggested that I

00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:31,939
do a community assessment along with

00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,280
some of my colleagues I defined what

00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:36,950
exactly a community assessment meant to

00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,920
me so I knew at least that I was going

00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:42,319
to have to be a detective there's an

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,180
American series of books Nancy Drew that

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,889
I loved when I was a kid and I was like

00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:49,280
cool I'm gonna get to be Nancy Drew

00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:52,519
she's a detective and as a detective I

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,859
was going to look at five things about a

00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:57,079
community I was going to take a look at

00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:59,239
its taxonomy the breakdown of the people

00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:01,760
within it I was going to look at how a

00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,819
project was used I was going to look at

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,430
the issues a project might have how one

00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:09,290
contributes to that project and what its

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,790
releases look like and then I know I

00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,560
said it was five things but there's six

00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,720
bullets the sixth thing that I would do

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,560
is to look at those five things four

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,729
similar tools and products or a project

00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,290
don't worry we're gonna go through each

00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:25,370
of these one by one and talk about what

00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:26,989
it means so community taxonomy the most

00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,819
important thing about a project as

00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:30,739
you've probably heard a lot during this

00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:32,989
conference is not the code itself it's

00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:34,849
the people so you should figure out the

00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:37,159
structure of what that project looks

00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:38,900
like now in Apache projects that's

00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:41,720
pretty easy because we have the whole

00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,790
PMC committers contributors but if you

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,199
were to apply this to a non Apache

00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,049
project it might look a little bit

00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,669
different given that we have that

00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:52,879
structure with the PM seeing the

00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:54,709
committers who are they where are they

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,389
based around the world sometimes it's

00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:58,760
nice to know if you're going to need to

00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:00,139
wait overnight for your PRS to be merged

00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,449
or not

00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:04,639
how many committers are there how busy

00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:06,049
are they if there aren't a lot of

00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:07,699
committers and it seems like a project

00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:10,069
is growing this could be an opportunity

00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:12,519
for you to build up your contributions

00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:16,220
and maybe become a committer yourself

00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:18,709
what companies are involved I know in

00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,779
the Apache world we don't really care

00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,460
who anyone works for but sometimes it's

00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:23,760
interesting if you know someone from a

00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,490
particular industry

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,290
is well-versed in a particular set of

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,850
technology that you're interested in

00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:32,100
using you might be able to learn from

00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,890
their expertise it's less from a

00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,960
political standpoint and also to know

00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,940
what companies are involved in the

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,850
project is there someone like a Google

00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:45,270
who is using airflow as a cloud composer

00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:47,580
and like any good superhero its kind of

00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,300
fun to learn the origin story where did

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,430
it come from

00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,660
so for airflow again I'm going to keep

00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,360
referring to airflow because that's what

00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,310
I know the best it came from Airbnb and

00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,610
then ended up in the incubator and

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,380
became a top level project last year the

00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,420
places that you can look to find all of

00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,150
this information you can look at a

00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:09,240
projects wiki you can look at its readme

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:11,670
you can look at its Docs you can read

00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,130
the email archives and you should start

00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:17,760
lurking on the dev list even if you have

00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:21,600
no idea what's going on all right

00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:23,850
so you know who is involved but when it

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,820
comes to like building the project but

00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:28,770
what about who's using it it's good to

00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,990
figure out if the users are individuals

00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:33,570
or if they're enterprise users or if

00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:36,450
they are some of each and like how many

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:39,990
users are there is it a ton is it not

00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:42,030
very many is it growing rapidly and is

00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,790
this a dependency of something bigger

00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:47,400
it's one thing to have like 10 user or

00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:49,830
yeah 10 users but to have those 10 users

00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,660
each have like four billion users that

00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,240
it's a pretty different story than just

00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:57,060
10 random people using your thing you

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,160
can look at things like libraries i/o if

00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,940
it's a python-based project you can look

00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,770
at pi pi pi you can use bigquery and if

00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,900
you were to go on pi PI you would see

00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,520
this statistics thing you can click on

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,040
that Google bigquery thing and it will

00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,420
give you the query to copy and paste you

00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,090
don't have to be able to write the query

00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:18,330
at all and that will break down usage by

00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:20,610
version which is really cool as a few

00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:23,610
months ago github also added this really

00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:25,560
nice used by tab and you can click on

00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:28,740
that and drill down to see what exactly

00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,480
those 508 used rise are these are the

00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,970
statistics for air flow but I think it's

00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,680
as of Monday so they may have gone up a

00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,080
little bit at least I hope they went up

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,319
and

00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,060
down okay we know about this community

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,400
taxonomy we know that there are

00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:45,009
hypothetically people using this project

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,110
you want to get into inherently if

00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:49,330
people are using something they're going

00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,159
to be issues I know we all want to think

00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,599
our projects are perfect but that's

00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:55,060
actually no fun because then there would

00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:56,800
be nothing else to work on you should

00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,560
take a look at the number of open issues

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,490
is it very money is it very few you

00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,039
should take a look at when they were

00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:05,289
last resolved are you going to be

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,659
sitting waiting forever in a day if you

00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:09,849
were to open up an issue where there a

00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:11,050
ton opened yesterday that have to do

00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:13,690
with something you know a lot about

00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:16,360
these are all ways where you could get

00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:18,550
involved how long does it take for an

00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,680
issue to be resolved again is it's like

00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:23,889
two hours two days two weeks two months

00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,389
two years helps gauge your expectations

00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:27,159
and how much potential heartache you

00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:29,889
could have finding out that a project

00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:32,110
really isn't that active how easy is it

00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:33,430
for you to submit an issue as a user if

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,009
you're starting to figure out this

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,270
project and you find something wrong and

00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:39,400
you want to submit an issue is it

00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,949
immediately obvious how to do that and

00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,560
how easy is it for someone new to the

00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:47,289
project to fix an issue is there a tag

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,449
on JIRA or on github if it's not an

00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:53,800
Apache project that says like good first

00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:56,139
issue or good for newbies obviously in

00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,060
the ASF for looking at JIRA and there's

00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:00,639
all kinds of ways that you can filter

00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:04,569
issues this was some air flow issues

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:07,120
ordered by priority you can also use

00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:09,190
JIRA to look at dashboards you can look

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,050
at things like how long it's taken

00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,770
issues to be resolved in the past 300

00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,810
days

00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,150
this graph is a few months old so I

00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:18,039
think it's gotten a little bit better

00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:21,250
and you could also be someone who

00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:23,590
creates dashboards for a project I show

00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:26,080
model who's a committer and airflow made

00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:29,199
these beautiful dashboards in JIRA so

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,930
this shows the created versus resolved

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,180
time for airflow issues and I think

00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:36,250
anyone can see this dashboard you may

00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,110
have to ask her for the link or you can

00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:42,969
send me a message and I'll point you to

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:44,709
it so even if if like it's not

00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:47,079
immediately obvious how you can jump in

00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:48,880
if you're able to give some statistics

00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:51,790
about issues to a project

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,860
pretty great place to start all right we

00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:57,070
know about the people we know about the

00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,420
usage we know about the issues how how

00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,730
are you going to contribute I've been

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,320
kind of alluding to it but some projects

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,930
like they might even spell out exactly

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,870
how you can do it so it's good to take a

00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:10,990
look at who contributes as we said the

00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:14,790
taxonomy but also taking a look at is it

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:17,830
more individuals or is it company driven

00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:19,690
how do you get started contributing is

00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,790
this immediately obvious from whatever

00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,750
googling you did to end up at that

00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:25,870
project

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:27,640
how often are PRS merged just like how

00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:30,520
often it takes for issues to be merged

00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:33,370
the for the rate at which PRS are merged

00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,530
can also like affect your expectations

00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:38,950
and affect your momentum as a potential

00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:41,440
contributor who's PRS get merged is it

00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:43,330
really a good supportive community where

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,250
you're seeing a lot of variety or is it

00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:48,070
like the same to people because it's not

00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:50,080
actually an apache project it's just

00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:52,980
someone's random hobby with their best

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,320
friend like in their basement who knows

00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,540
and the way that you can look at that

00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,700
github you have the contributors and

00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,530
this is the ones for airflow as of this

00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,510
week these were the top four that are

00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:07,180
listed in it it changes you can see

00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,650
their github handles you can take a look

00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,610
really drill down see where they're from

00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:13,810
if you want you can sort that on various

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:16,530
statistics you can take a look at the

00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:19,210
wiki to see if committers contributors

00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:21,940
are listed and if there's instructions

00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:24,160
for how to commit and hopefully

00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:27,130
hopefully they have a contributing MD or

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,800
contributing rst that spells out okay

00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:32,530
step one you can tell us what our bugs

00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,870
are step two you can help us fix Doc's

00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:36,790
error messages all the way down to what

00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:40,570
you need to do to make a code

00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:41,080
contribution if that's your jam all

00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,660
right

00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,550
so if you're able to contribute code or

00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,190
if anyone is able to contribute code or

00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:50,080
anything that means that this project is

00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:52,330
probably going through releases and

00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,810
releases can tell you a lot about how a

00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:58,030
community organizes so the first thing

00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:00,130
to look at is how often these releases

00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:02,290
are happening is it like once a year is

00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:04,720
it once every six months

00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:07,600
once a month once a week just trying to

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,209
figure out how quickly or not quickly

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,279
this community works there it's in any

00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:13,810
way that's better or worse it will just

00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:16,180
tell you how this group of people works

00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:18,910
together are they following the apache

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,889
way if it's an Apache project you would

00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:23,800
hope so

00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:26,620
our non-binding opinions listen to I

00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,389
when a release happens in the dev list

00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,279
there's an email that goes out that says

00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:32,680
we're looking for votes on this release

00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:35,440
but people can also express opinions

00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,569
even if they don't have voting power so

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,880
how are they treated are they listened

00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:42,130
to are they respectful the ones who are

00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,110
actually expressing non-binding opinions

00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:47,410
this can tell you a lot about the people

00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:49,920
within the project are they following

00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:53,440
semantic versioning in they're releasing

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,240
you can again read that dev list and if

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,220
it's a Python project you can take a

00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,199
look at the release history that's one

00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,490
way you can see the velocity of it you

00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:02,740
can even see that there's a release

00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:06,069
candidate for airflow from less than a

00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,779
week ago so now that you have all this

00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:09,490
information you know about how these

00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:11,560
people involved you know about people

00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,510
using this project you know what happens

00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,160
when things go wrong you know how to

00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,750
contribute you're like basically a

00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,880
professional at this point and you know

00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,100
the releases if you want to really

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,139
actually give those random numbers

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,760
you've collected some meaning you should

00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:27,550
take a look at some similar tools and

00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:31,000
projects or products you should take a

00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:32,709
look at if what you're exploring versus

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,209
this similar tool if they are both

00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:37,029
community driven or if they're both

00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:39,040
company driven for example air flow is a

00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:40,600
community driven project but if you look

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,970
at something like tensorflow

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,149
that's definitely more company driven by

00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,500
Google where they do accept outside

00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:50,620
contributions but it's not at as

00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:53,199
frequent of every as one of like the

00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:56,170
Apache projects how old are these

00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:58,630
projects is one of them like six months

00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,519
old and the other five years old that

00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:03,699
could explain for some differences

00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:05,740
what's the tooling used is it to produce

00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:07,569
it is it the same or different is one of

00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,250
them on github and one of them is on

00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:13,029
something else that's harder for new

00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:14,860
people to use are they using some CI CD

00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:17,950
tool that makes releases me

00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:20,590
easy to do or are they not can explain

00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:22,900
differences so for this I looked at

00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:26,110
Luigi which is a workflow tool that's

00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:28,420
from Spotify so again comparing the same

00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:31,300
used by watches stars and forks on

00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:35,250
github it has more use buys than air

00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:37,570
flow but it has fewer stars and forks

00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,100
because it's from Spotify which is a

00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,320
company we know that this is company

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,210
driven they definitely do not accept

00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,060
very many PRS from the outside world

00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:48,490
they have their issues on github and not

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,470
in JIRA and we can see that they have 42

00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,900
open issues I can tell you that for air

00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,550
flow there is well over a thousand but

00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,020
there could be a lot of reasons for this

00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:59,200
so I know

00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,670
Spotify as a company they probably have

00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,410
someone who's going through and checking

00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,840
this and maybe is doing more grooming

00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,700
and fixing of those issues or for all we

00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,380
know please tell me if someone works a

00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,940
Spotify here that you might have an

00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,400
internal bug component where they're

00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:15,580
tracking things too we see that they

00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:18,760
have 20 open PRS we do have more open

00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:21,460
PRS and air flow I know that Spotify is

00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,810
a pretty aggressive stale PR bot but

00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,760
again they have people who are working

00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:27,670
on this full-time is a company driven

00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:29,380
project no air flow has a PR bot its

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,180
health has gone up and down but it's

00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,820
still there and people are working hard

00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:35,620
to reduce that number so what should you

00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,940
do if you do this you've like tried to

00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,560
figure out what's going on and you

00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,890
presumably have figured out what's going

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,900
on

00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,640
so you should save that info so that you

00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,230
can refer to it when you go back to

00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,090
looking at this in two weeks the next

00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,100
time you remember it so that it's not

00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,930
just information lost you should

00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,150
consider making this information as a

00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:54,400
contribution but if you do you should do

00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:56,290
so kindly and only if appropriate if

00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,970
you're not quite sure how to do that I

00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,860
would recommend sending an email to the

00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:02,080
Dead list you can tell them exactly what

00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,970
you found you can say hi I'm Lea I found

00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,430
all of this info about air flow and I'm

00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:08,470
interested to see if this is useful for

00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:10,270
you what's the best way for me to share

00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,770
it and people in the community will help

00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:13,840
guide you or they might tell you

00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:16,690
actually we have all this info collected

00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,310
somewhere here's the dashboard and then

00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:20,260
maybe your contribution is making that

00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,970
dashboard easier to find for someone

00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,940
else who might try to collect that info

00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:26,980
and then you should do it again maybe in

00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,850
a month maybe in six months maybe in a

00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,680
year these numbers

00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,449
mean too much until we compared them to

00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,310
a similar product or tool but these

00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:37,009
numbers are even more meaningful if you

00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:38,690
compare a project against itself the

00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:42,709
first time I gave this talk was in May

00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:45,589
and air flows like used by forks watches

00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:47,839
were less than Spotify flew eg by a lot

00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:49,850
and as of now most of those numbers have

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,100
surpassed them in the past few months so

00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:55,399
that's a compelling story and tells you

00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,899
that the usage is growing so the TLDR

00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:58,850
which if you're not familiar with that

00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:01,069
acronym means too long didn't read this

00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,480
is a short version take your time when

00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:04,819
you're trying to figure out what's going

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,160
on in an open-source community it's okay

00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:08,540
to not know what's going on do your

00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,310
