Getting involved with an OSS community for the first time can be daunting. Taking time to analyze an OSS community can make that involvement more approachable, and ultimately results in more meaningful contributions to the community. Leah will walk through Google's involvement with Apache Airflow, the process she took to learn about the project and its community, and how you can use this process when getting started with any OSS community.
