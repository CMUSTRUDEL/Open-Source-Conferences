Oracle has introduced a new release train for the Java platform. Instead of having relatively long lived major releases with no breaking changes, new major releases will now be published every six months. Furthermore Oracle announced that binary compatibility may be broken between major releases. The new model of releasing Java versions together with Java's module system poses new challenges on library authors. This talk explores what this means for the Apache Commons project - a project providing some of the most used libraries in the Java ecosystem.
