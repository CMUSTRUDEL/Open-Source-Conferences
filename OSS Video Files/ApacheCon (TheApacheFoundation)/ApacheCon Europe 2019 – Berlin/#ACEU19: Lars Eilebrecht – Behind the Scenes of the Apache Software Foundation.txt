This presentation will give you everything you always wanted to know about the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), but were afraid to ask. It will show you that there is more than just the Apache web server, and provide you with information on how the ASF works and its history. The difference between membership and committership, who decides what, how elections take place, the technical infrastructure, project management committees, and the philosophy behind the incubator. Come and see behind the scenes of the Apache Software Foundation and let's talk about "The Apache Way" and "Community over Code" which have been the cornerstones of the ASF for 20 years.

	00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:10,790
this talk is going to extend on on this

00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:13,100
it's called the behind the scenes of the

00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,960
Apache Software Foundation it's not

00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,930
behind to see

00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,140
there's like secrets that I'm revealing

00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:21,550
here it's basically as we've tried to

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,700
explain in the previous keynotes already

00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:27,570
is the ASF is a very very open

00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,920
organization before I continue just a

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:33,250
few comments about myself my name is

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,620
Lars I left I'm an independent security

00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,879
consultant I used to be based in London

00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,309
for the last ten years I actually moved

00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:40,360
to this beautiful city of Berlin last

00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:42,220
last months

00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,930
so the first Apache con and I've been to

00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,940
many Apache conferences where I'm

00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:48,250
actually local to the city where the

00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,370
conference takes place and I've been

00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:53,530
contributing to Apache web server since

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:56,200
1996 I'm a member of the areas of

00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,940
security team and yeah if you've been to

00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,960
the founders panel I'm one of the

00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:05,440
cofounders of the of the ASF and what I

00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,930
want to cover in this presentation is by

00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,290
the explaining what is the Apache

00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:12,729
Software Foundation the ASF David nolley

00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:16,050
already explained this it's a u.s.

00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:18,070
nonprofit charitable organization

00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:23,320
incorporated in the state of Delaware in

00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:25,540
1999 and one of the important and unique

00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:29,049
things about their service we only have

00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:34,180
individuals as members as a company you

00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:36,580
cannot subscribe or all pay together to

00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:40,960
become a member or to buy yourself a

00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:44,439
seat on the board of directors so the

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,930
NSF does not pay for anyone to do

00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:50,770
software development all the work is

00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:53,470
done by by by volunteers and we do have

00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:55,420
a few exception where by now we actually

00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,850
do pay for certain services we do not

00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,950
really have employees but we do pay for

00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,960
certain services one of them is the

00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,610
system administration like we have

00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,829
people on the infrastructure team and

00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:08,110
who get paid to make sure that things

00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:11,049
are running the times in the very

00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:14,440
beginning where we had 20 30 40 people

00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:16,840
working on projects it was possible to

00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,090
do this on a voluntary basis but now it

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,730
was like 7,000 committers if some of the

00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,470
important infrastructure goes down yeah

00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,950
you usually see where this is going so

00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,390
system administrators we pay for some

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,330
secretarial

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,610
as executive assistant and some press

00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:35,160
services so that's things we pay for as

00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,530
a service but in general and the

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,770
development the software development is

00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,200
all done by volunteers and that also

00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,540
includes the volunteer work like people

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,090
who contribute to the foundation not in

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:51,540
terms of like contributing code but

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:54,360
contributing their time yeah to grow the

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:57,420
foundation basically let's step back a

00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,400
little bit macaques in the in the

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,489
founders panel mentioned this a little

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:07,110
bit and and endured Willam as well that

00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:10,800
in 1995 the most popular web server was

00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:14,519
the NCSA web server and many people were

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,670
using it but it was becoming

00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:20,280
unmaintained the the the budget the

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:23,340
grant money that the university had for

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,510
the NCSA httpd was was running out but

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:29,760
people were using it so at some point

00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:30,930
some people got together and brian

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,209
behlendorf was the one who actually

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:38,100
created the mailing list on his personal

00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:40,860
all one of his personal websites called

00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:44,810
new httpd and invited the various

00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:47,610
various people to come in and discuss

00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:51,090
how they can extend the NCSI web server

00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,680
and maybe create a new web server well

00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,320
the good thing was the NCI web server

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,530
was published under an open-source

00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:01,290
license a bsd-style license so it was

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:04,019
actually possible to just take the

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:08,220
source code and and work with it

00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:10,709
basically so here's a picture that was

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,440
taken at the very very first Apache core

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:16,769
1998 so that predates the creation of

00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,739
the the ASF of the foundation which

00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:22,979
shows not all but most of the members of

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:27,289
the Apache group I'm the geeky looking

00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:29,729
guy in the middle with a red shirt and

00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:34,039
sometimes I get asked so where does the

00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:40,710
name Apache come from why why Apache and

00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:41,340
there's a one explanation that's kind of

00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,270
true but

00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:46,320
really true is that has come from the

00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:49,560
Apache server because we had this

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:53,760
meaningless new httpd exchanging patches

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:56,310
to to make things better to to fix bugs

00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,240
etc so with all these patches going back

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,440
and forth we had a patchy server and

00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,500
someone mentioned that and it kind of

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,860
became retrospectively the reason why

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,169
it's called Apache however the name was

00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,810
originally I think proposed by Brian

00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:15,000
burned off out of respect for the

00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:18,960
various Native American nations

00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,090
collectively referred to as Apache they

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,440
are well known for their for their

00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:26,570
endurance and for their strategy and

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,680
also have a very distributed

00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,330
organizational structure on a really

00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,220
organizational structure but a very

00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,570
distributed structure and that was the

00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,910
same with the Apache group we had

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:39,389
members in different and different

00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:43,410
continents and from from different

00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:46,410
backgrounds I'm looking at the the web

00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:48,720
server software at that time things have

00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:52,289
changed in the last few years but

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,600
throughout the last twenty years or more

00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:56,250
than twenty years like we've had the the

00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,810
highest market share we've ever had was

00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:02,580
somewhere around 72 or 73 percent I

00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:05,940
think one of the reasons why the Apache

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:08,520
became so successful was one was

00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:11,520
obviously it was the right time it was

00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:15,000
like 1995 I want that time was a time

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:18,330
when the when the web and web sites were

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,260
taking off the whole web was still in

00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:24,539
its its infancy at that time but that

00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:27,030
changed rapidly and the Apache was

00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:30,450
available under an open-source license

00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:32,130
under the Apache Software license and

00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,770
therefore free to use and it had a

00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:38,490
actually a modular design which made it

00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:40,320
easy to adapt it to how we wanted to run

00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:43,860
your web site you could use static pages

00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,450
and there was mod PHP which for a

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,419
certain period of time was actually an

00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:49,860
Apache project now they are separate

00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:53,909
there's mud Perl and a few other things

00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:55,260
so you had a at that time or still a

00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:56,580
very modern

00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,980
webserver that would meet the

00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,650
requirements of various websites will

00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:04,380
adjust its a a small personal thing an

00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,690
internal website or actually what you

00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:13,140
would consider a high-traffic website at

00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:15,360
at that time and but we needed we needed

00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:18,630
more than just a kind of like a loosely

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,470
a loose group of people there was no

00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:24,720
legal entity there was no organization

00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:28,950
and we created the the ASF for various

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:32,400
reasons one was we needed protection we

00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:34,710
saw abuse or potential threat from

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,260
companies who tried to abuse a brand

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:40,350
name try to make money with with Apache

00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:43,110
in certain ways or we simply let's say

00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:46,170
annoyed at the market share of the

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:48,420
Apache web server and we also had had

00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:51,870
companies like IBM at that time who

00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:54,660
wanted to use the Apache web server as

00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:57,210
part of one of their products IBM

00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,160
WebSphere but they couldn't grab the

00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,010
head around the fact that there's no

00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,740
organization how can we partner with

00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:07,370
something that's just a bunch of guys

00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:11,160
exchanging patches on a mailing list so

00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:14,760
all of these reasons led to the decision

00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:17,100
to actually create the ASF and what it

00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,990
provides is I mean if you do open-source

00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,780
development you can go to like github

00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:23,790
and put your your source code then put

00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:29,010
an open-source license on it yes that's

00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:31,740
that's open-source the NSF provides that

00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:34,950
that basic development environment which

00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,840
today is easy to get back back then it

00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,910
wasn't that easy to actually get all

00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:43,560
that for for your project that you

00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:46,290
wanted to to start running but um the

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:53,370
answer provides provides more it

00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:57,510
provides basically a environment where

00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:59,420
people can collaborate and the apache

00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:04,140
license is an important part of that

00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:06,000
because one of the requirements for an

00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,070
Apache project is that it must be

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,180
distributed under the Apache Software

00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,010
license

00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:14,070
as a user you can be assured that if you

00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,660
go to Apache org one of the project web

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:19,910
pages and download something that it

00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,910
will be under the Apache License and

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,720
basically back in the day you could just

00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,180
publish something but the days were it's

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,490
possible for developer to just publish

00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:32,520
something I kind of over you need to

00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,890
worry about potential lawsuits and we

00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,740
saw this back in the day that individual

00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:40,920
developers were threatened with a

00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,790
lawsuit with about copyright patents

00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,680
whatever

00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,860
so the Apache Software license and the

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,380
ASF as a legal entity protects and

00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:55,470
shields the individual developers from

00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:59,190
this potential threat and most important

00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:04,550
there as a nonprofit organization is

00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:10,340
able to solicit donations and provide

00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:13,740
resources in the form of infrastructure

00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:16,620
creating events Apache con hackathons

00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:23,880
and contribute that back to the to the

00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:32,130
community you have already mentioned the

00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:34,860
software license talking about a few

00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:38,010
numbers David already mentioned this to

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:40,620
some extent in his in his keynote in his

00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:44,220
state of the feather keynote and we

00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:46,770
started with just three projects Apache

00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:49,230
web server the Jakarta project out of

00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:51,810
which we put Java applications such as

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:55,020
Tomcat and a conference planning project

00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:57,120
very quickly we we get we got additional

00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:59,550
projects and if you look at it today we

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:04,230
have more than 350 projects and

00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:06,570
initiatives and about 50 so-called pod

00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,970
links in the incubator project I'm going

00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:11,010
to explain the incubator in a little bit

00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:14,310
more detail in just a minute

00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:18,830
and we started was twenty one committers

00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:21,930
and now we have something like 7,500

00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,949
committers and more than 600 or so more

00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:26,639
than 700

00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:28,769
sixty members of the foundation and a

00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:32,540
total of 200 million lines of codes

00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:34,739
sitting in our source code repositories

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,889
David showed this chart already so

00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:42,660
basically over time you see that we have

00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:45,269
a very very steady growth of committers

00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:48,119
and if you look at this in terms of

00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:51,059
active committees we actually see fairly

00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:53,509
regularly over the last months or years

00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:57,749
actually that there's always between

00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:58,699
1,500 to 2,000 active committees every

00:11:57,749 --> 00:12:00,899
month

00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:03,660
and I think that's quite important to

00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:06,529
show that there's still things happening

00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:09,329
there's not just new projects and

00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:14,459
there's still activity in all these

00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:18,059
projects um an important part of the ASF

00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:20,279
is is meritocracy it's about basically

00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:22,220
the as organized as a so called

00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:24,689
meritocracy basically it's about

00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:28,970
responsibility is about the ability and

00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:32,549
talent basically the more you contribute

00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:36,929
the more merit you you get or the more

00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:39,209
merit you have and you get or usually

00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:42,720
you have more power to do things powers

00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:44,490
and people listen to you it's not power

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,549
in the sense that your job title allows

00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:49,139
you to make decisions it's basically if

00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:51,629
you have been one of the major

00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:54,110
contributors people will listen to what

00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:56,249
you have to say on the on the many list

00:12:54,110 --> 00:13:00,689
and that kind of like an important

00:12:56,249 --> 00:13:05,009
development philosophy at the ASF the

00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:07,290
the basis on merit so basically the

00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:10,049
responsibilities are given based on the

00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:12,240
demonstrated ability and talent that you

00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:13,169
have and as I explained earlier is not

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,559
just about code contributions

00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:20,639
contributions can come in all forms and

00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:22,860
insiders and just to briefly explain

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,509
what sometimes referred to as a chain of

00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,579
merit I'm not sure I really like this

00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:28,350
term anymore but it it kind of shows

00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:31,980
that obviously at some point you start

00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:33,840
using one or more Apache applications

00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,990
applications

00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,810
apache software as a as a user you can

00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:43,620
become a or becoming a contributor is a

00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:45,620
very small step actually it doesn't mean

00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,550
code contributions it can mean

00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:50,790
participating on the development reading

00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:52,500
list helping or answering questions from

00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:57,980
other users on the user Mattingly's

00:13:52,500 --> 00:14:01,170
helping other users I came in suggesting

00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:03,540
new new features or fixing bugs in the

00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:08,430
documentation and obviously caught

00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:12,210
contributions if you contribute to a

00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:13,560
project at some point it depends

00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:15,510
each project handled is slightly

00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,160
differently but typically if you have an

00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:19,470
interest and show that you want to

00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,140
contribute to a project you are made a

00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:25,560
committer of that project in some cases

00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:27,840
you basically just ask can I can I can I

00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,190
join you guys I want to I want to help

00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,680
with this or it's something I'm using as

00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:34,230
well in some cases you have to like

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,620
first start with committing some or

00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:40,200
submitting some patches and some

00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:45,390
contributions and then it will be made a

00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:46,740
committer um as I try to explain this

00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:51,930
morning in the funders panel as well

00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:53,460
becoming a foundation member or so if

00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:55,710
really going back to the project member

00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:57,720
most most projects typically don't have

00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:59,130
this separate step anymore I think some

00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,060
projects like the webserver project

00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,830
still has that where there's a

00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,570
difference between a committer

00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:05,640
someone who has commit access to the

00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:08,940
repositories where there's someone who

00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,440
is a so-called project or pmc project

00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,620
management committee member like the

00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,810
core team of the of the project and for

00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:18,060
most teams that's the same thing these

00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:20,160
these days but there's no direct

00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,839
requirement to be one of these things or

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,880
being a committer before you can become

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:28,700
a foundation number and I mentioned this

00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:33,930
this morning some valuable contributions

00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:36,420
we have received from from members and

00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:39,450
from individuals who've never developed

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:42,240
a single line of code but the more

00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:44,640
common way is obviously by participating

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,709
in one or maybe even more projects and

00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,790
showing an interest in the foundation

00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:50,220
itself

00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:53,790
that at some point you will get invited

00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:57,300
to become a member of the foundation and

00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:58,800
this wonderful slide which is very very

00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,630
high level I'm gonna explain a little

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,940
bit how this how this process works

00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:05,010
because I could ask this quite quite

00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:08,750
frequently like how do I become a member

00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:14,790
of the foundation what do I need to do

00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:17,520
basically being the u.s. corporation we

00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:20,910
have to have a member meeting once a

00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:23,550
year and we use that to talk about you

00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:26,460
had a budget what the board has done and

00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:29,130
etc so that's the the basic operation

00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:32,580
things we have to do and but we also use

00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:34,470
that to vote in new members basically to

00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:36,780
become a member of the foundation

00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:39,600
it needs a majority vote so more than

00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:42,420
50% of all the existing members have to

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,300
vote yes to make someone a member of the

00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:47,880
foundation and before the meeting we

00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:51,200
typically have a period of no at least a

00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:55,470
month or two where people would nominate

00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:58,740
existing committees or individuals for

00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:02,190
membership in the foundation and we do

00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:04,250
rely on our members to actually find

00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:07,160
these people who they think should

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:10,170
become a member of the of the foundation

00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:12,890
and in some cases we have a list of more

00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:17,130
than a hundred something nominations and

00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:19,560
I think typically they've only been very

00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:22,110
few exceptions I can recall where

00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:25,560
someone who was nominated wasn't elected

00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:27,420
so typically if someone gets nominated

00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,370
there is typically a reason for this and

00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,620
it's usually very likely that that

00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:34,010
person will then after the meeting

00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:37,280
become a member of the of the foundation

00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:39,990
so what what does it mean as a member of

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:44,160
the foundation you're basically one of

00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:46,920
the stakeholders of the foundation we

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,930
have the we have the board of directors

00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,570
which also gets elected once a year and

00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:54,420
that same membership meeting again

00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:57,390
there's a nomination period so people

00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:59,700
tend to nominate others who I think

00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,960
should be on the board because of the

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:08,909
work they are doing or because

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:14,059
of their contributions basically and the

00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:17,159
board basically oversees the the ASF

00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:22,110
it's not like the individual projects

00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:24,779
have have to listen to technical advice

00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:26,820
as David said that there's no CTO who

00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:28,320
tells people this is what we should do

00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,360
from a technical point of view every

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,740
project is basically individual

00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,850
otherwise this whole thing wouldn't

00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:40,520
really scale we have more than 350

00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:43,140
projects they work individually they can

00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,419
make decisions on how they want to run

00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,580
their day-to-day operations when they

00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:49,830
want to do release what kind of features

00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,240
they put in there and one I think

00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:54,120
interesting thing is although with the

00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,880
NSF which is different to I think of a

00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:00,980
company we there's absolutely no problem

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:04,950
with having projects which fill the same

00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:07,770
need like we have multiple web servers

00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:09,539
at the at the NSF we have several

00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:12,090
applications which basically do the same

00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:14,399
same thing as long as there's a

00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:16,559
community a healthy community around

00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:22,470
each of these projects that's perfectly

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:24,419
fine so going back to this to the

00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:27,870
diagram so we have the users the

00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:33,059
contributors and the governance bit is

00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:36,090
what's what's important the board cannot

00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:40,260
do everything themselves basically how

00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:42,200
they exercise their oversight of the

00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:45,990
different projects is by appointing

00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:48,630
so-called project chairs like the VP of

00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,549
a project so basically if even if you

00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:52,710
have a very new project with just a few

00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:57,330
people there will be one person assigned

00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:59,940
to be the VP of Apache XYZ and that

00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:03,179
doesn't give that person the power to

00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:05,610
make decisions over everyone's head or

00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:07,409
technical decisions it basically comes

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:11,970
with responsibilities which includes

00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:14,290
regular reporting towards the board of

00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:16,360
directors

00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:17,470
to see is the professional healthy are

00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,510
there any issues

00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:23,080
is there anything where the board may

00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:26,410
need to take action are there any legal

00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:28,980
issues or anything really and and that's

00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:32,170
basically what what the repiy is

00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:34,300
responsible for so with these are these

00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:42,370
are the offices of the of the foundation

00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:44,320
in this in this chart we talked a little

00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:46,560
bit about communication already in the

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,360
previous keynotes

00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:52,600
at the NSF it's all about mailing lists

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:56,820
but sometimes to new people joining a

00:20:52,600 --> 00:21:00,010
project takes some getting used to

00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:04,960
we're all distributed we're not just

00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:07,090
sitting in the same office and a very

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,250
important statement from from Y fielding

00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:12,010
is basically if it didn't happen on the

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:15,460
mailing list it didn't happen so yes

00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:18,430
other means of communication instant

00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:23,170
messaging platforms whatever can be used

00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:25,390
but any kind of decisions or relevant

00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:27,070
information has to come back to the

00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:29,680
mailing list in the form of someone

00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:32,770
posting about it or this is what I like

00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:37,720
like like a proposal to give people a

00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:42,070
chance to contribute and to maybe vote

00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:45,630
on it on order maybe have some some yeah

00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,630
a feedback about it

00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:55,700
sometimes dealing on the mailing list

00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:58,310
can be on a busy man this can be a bit

00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,200
difficult so something to get as how our

00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:02,210
decisions actually made this like

00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,850
someone said something about a new

00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:07,400
feature and then there's 50 responses to

00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:10,730
that email and then how do I know what's

00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,890
going to happen one thing that if you're

00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:14,600
not used to it that that you may find

00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:17,060
odd in the beginning on a mailing list

00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,310
is people responding with just the plus

00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,650
1 or a minus 1 in their in their

00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:25,400
response but nothing else what that

00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:27,920
simply means is yes you can just write

00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,290
something about what was said in the

00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,540
previous email and your reply but if you

00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:34,820
want to simply provide a statement of

00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:37,970
yes I'm in favor of this whether it's a

00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:40,790
new feature the release date or a change

00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:43,070
or something you just say plus one it's

00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:45,620
basically like add me to the list of

00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:48,350
people who are in favor of this whether

00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:50,270
it's an official vote which usually gets

00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:53,810
put into the subject line in brackets

00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:58,640
boat or just another normal email were

00:22:53,810 --> 00:23:01,370
just people show that they're in favor

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,200
of whatever is being discussed the same

00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:06,290
is like if it's a minus one it's it's a

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,360
veto it's basically I miss agree with

00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:10,520
this plan or with this change or with

00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,080
this patch however you cannot just

00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,730
continue emailing and saying I am

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,450
against this I'm against this this this

00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:18,560
doesn't work basically if you if you

00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:21,470
respond with a minus one you have to

00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:23,350
provide a reason why you're against this

00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:26,060
that's often reasonably straightforward

00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:28,310
well not always but if it's a patch

00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:30,500
there's usually a technical reason why

00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:32,180
maybe that patch doesn't make sense or

00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,180
maybe there's a bug in it maybe

00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:37,820
sometimes people automatically point out

00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:39,890
minus one but here's the thing you need

00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:42,950
to fix and then this is this is a plus

00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:45,770
one phone for me rarely but sometimes

00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:50,230
people say also zero which is like I

00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:50,230
abstain or I'm not not sure about this

00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:55,780
another thing that that's common in the

00:23:53,330 --> 00:24:02,300
in the software development projects is

00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:04,340
how commits are done there's RT C were

00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,559
the CTR Reb you then commit

00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,299
whether it's commit and review so

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:11,210
basically the main list also help with

00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:13,460
this because everyone is distributed in

00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:17,169
different time zones so if you're

00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:20,120
working on a let's say a stable branch

00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:24,289
it would typically be a Reb you then

00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:26,929
commit way of doing the of handling

00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:29,179
changes to the to the branch basically

00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:32,450
you have to show your patch first this

00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:36,559
is what I want to commit and you need a

00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:38,720
few plus ones before you actually allow

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,250
to commit this again every project

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,320
handle this in a slightly different way

00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,659
but it's very common to have these two

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,580
two approaches typically stable branch

00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:48,799
which is what is a non stable branch or

00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:52,039
development branch but basically is like

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:54,980
okay everyone just commit ahead do your

00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:57,740
changes and people are expected to

00:24:54,980 --> 00:25:01,159
retrospectively review a patch that has

00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:04,340
been has been committed and we talked a

00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:07,309
bit about the term the opechee way and

00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:09,889
that's kind of part of this as well if

00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:11,419
you ask different people to define what

00:25:09,889 --> 00:25:16,490
the apache ways you get slightly

00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:18,710
different answers I would say I would

00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:20,779
say that it relates to how they have the

00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:23,870
air of pace how the ASF is basically

00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:24,649
structured and how it operates so it

00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,529
means different things to different

00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:31,279
people but I mentioned the the earned

00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:33,019
authority the merit I mentioned the

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,629
community of peers so we have

00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:38,210
individuals we don't have organizations

00:25:35,629 --> 00:25:40,159
who make decisions on which features get

00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:43,700
included or when the release is being

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,440
made we have open communication we have

00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:48,470
public many in this all development

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:51,700
meeting this open everyone can just

00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:56,090
subscribe to that mailing list and start

00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:58,730
discussing the development or starting

00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:01,190
to contribute we have consensus

00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:03,440
decision-making we have this dispo ting

00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:05,299
we have what I mentioned with the review

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,360
then commit or commit and review like

00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:09,860
lazy consensus if I get even if there's

00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,230
like hundreds of developers in a project

00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:14,210
if I get two or three depending how does

00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:17,400
he find two or three plus one votes I'm

00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:19,740
good to go ahead and commit my my patch

00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,990
and we have this responsible oversight

00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:25,020
from the Foundation's point of view and

00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:28,050
the the the the governance but also the

00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:31,920
the trust and the delegated oversight

00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:34,800
and that each project basically handled

00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:38,100
their day-to-day business and operations

00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:41,580
and then it's the apache license how the

00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:44,190
project are managed and the community of

00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:46,290
a code part where we've already

00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:48,690
mentioned in the keynote this morning it

00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:51,300
is really about the people the people is

00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:53,630
what matters the code is important

00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:56,460
obviously that's what we want at the end

00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:58,559
but without the community without a

00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:07,130
healthy community that simply doesn't

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:09,600
doesn't work and it's it's also the

00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:12,510
we're all volunteers on these projects

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:16,400
yes some people get paid by a company to

00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:20,010
contribute to a particular project but

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:22,830
we need diversity in a in a project we

00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:24,720
don't have projects that's just

00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:27,480
developed by one company there's always

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,110
a mix of of people from different

00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,970
companies different geographical regions

00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:34,980
different countries and different

00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:37,800
different interests that participate in

00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:40,380
a project so this diversity ensures that

00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:42,270
a project is able to survive and that

00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:46,190
brings you back to the to the incubator

00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:48,870
I'll talk about this in a in a minute

00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:53,100
maybe one what we've comment about the

00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:56,429
the Apache feather some like about three

00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:58,050
years ago we actually someone actually

00:27:56,429 --> 00:28:00,090
thought it's time to change the Apache

00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:02,309
feather the one on the left hand side is

00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:06,090
the original one that I think it was

00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:08,850
when dieter Bush proposed after Brian

00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:10,830
mentioned the Apache name we said okay

00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:14,100
if you want to call it Apache looks good

00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:15,750
to me but here's the here's like a logo

00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,970
how about we combine this and then

00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:20,640
that's what we call our new web server

00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:21,360
and everyone busy said like yeah and it

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,640
looks good to me

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,790
so we had this this Apache feather for

00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:29,310
for basically over 17 or almost 17 years

00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:32,130
or actually more than 17 years

00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:33,990
and so at some point we wanted something

00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:35,850
more more modern and came up with the

00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:38,610
one on the on the right-hand side which

00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:41,670
is not what you see everywhere when you

00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:43,320
look at the patchy stuff I think for me

00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:44,970
being around for for that long

00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,630
took some getting used to but it has

00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:50,760
definitely definitely grown on me by now

00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:53,250
um but there's more than just software

00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,590
development projects at the at the ASF

00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:57,540
so apart from from the development

00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:59,760
projects we have some foundation buy

00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:02,340
projects or initiatives and I'm going to

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,730
go through a few of them I can't cover

00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:07,590
everything but a few important ones one

00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:11,510
very very important one is the Apache

00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:13,860
Incubator so we have currently 50 odd

00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:15,270
projects in the incubator they're

00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:18,090
referred to as pod links in the

00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:20,610
incubator they are not yet apache

00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:22,950
projects they have to go through this

00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:25,020
incubation process whether they are a

00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:28,830
new project that has been started like

00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:31,320
from like a greenfield development or if

00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:37,020
it's a donation from a company or

00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:40,740
individual towards the NSF one one goal

00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:42,300
is to make sure that if we get a

00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:45,120
donation from your company is that we

00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:47,610
have sorted out the legal bit around the

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:52,470
installation so make sure that the NSF

00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:55,470
has a license or grant to actually

00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:57,840
distribute the software the code under

00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:59,790
the Apache Software license and to make

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,400
sure that all contributions and patches

00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:04,320
are accounted for it also exists to make

00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:07,020
sure that we develop the communities

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,570
again if it's just developers from one

00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:12,660
company that's great but we need more

00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:14,670
diversity basically you cannot become an

00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:18,210
Apache project if there's just one

00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:21,900
company developing or providing active

00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:24,510
developers and also to see if isn't

00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:26,220
actually an interest in this project can

00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:28,200
we actually find new developers who are

00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:31,850
interested in actually working on this

00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:36,210
project is it is it relevant basically

00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:37,830
the average time varies typically it's

00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,810
around a year to go through the

00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:43,120
incubation process it can be much faster

00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:46,450
can be much longer and sometimes it

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:51,430
takes very long or a project even fails

00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:54,730
to become or to graduate from the

00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:57,760
incubator as it is called sometimes for

00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:59,770
various reasons but typically this all

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,410
works out and at some point the project

00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:05,230
becomes a top-level project if you're

00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:07,390
interested incubated Apache dot-org

00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:09,700
explains in a bit more detail how the

00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:12,280
incubation process works how you could

00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:15,850
potentially propose something for the

00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:18,880
for the incubator and and that's about

00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:20,590
that's about new projects what about old

00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,410
projects we have to actually have a

00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:24,760
project called the Apache attic for

00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:28,720
sometimes we put a project into the

00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:30,940
Attic so to speak and it happens I think

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,360
we can only have something like between

00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:37,360
40 or 50 projects in there it's

00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:40,390
sometimes simply happens because a

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,460
technology is no longer relevant we

00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:44,980
don't want to have a page like a web

00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:47,710
page that just shows outdated

00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:50,410
information so the the Apache attic

00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:53,160
project provides or the intent is to be

00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:56,200
non impacting to users basically

00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:58,270
providing restricted oversight over the

00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,100
code bases making sure that users can

00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:02,500
still download the source code can still

00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:05,230
download the releases can get access to

00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,060
the documentation because yes even like

00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:08,890
an outdated technology yeah this

00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:12,250
probably still being used by some by

00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:15,250
some companies and there's a management

00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:17,890
committee around this which which

00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:21,040
manages the the attic project the intent

00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:23,410
is not to to rebuild a community this is

00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,210
really about this is archiving the the

00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:30,340
project but making sure everything is

00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:31,660
still available potentially we there may

00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,670
be very rare cases where we would

00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:37,060
consider a security bug fix for for

00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:39,040
something but typically the the intent

00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:41,170
is to not make any bug fixes to not make

00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,630
any more releases basically once it's in

00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:46,960
there the the project has found its

00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:53,440
natural end so to speak we have a brand

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:55,120
management committee apache / foundation

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,860
/ marks if you're interested so

00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,900
basically it's responsible for four

00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:04,150
setting policy around all these

00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:06,429
wonderful brands and trademarks etcetera

00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:09,010
that we have at the at the NSF and

00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:11,320
making sure that companies actually

00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:14,020
follow these these policies because

00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:16,830
sometimes yeah companies intentionally

00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:19,630
or in most cases not not intentionally

00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:21,460
abused the trademark or the other brand

00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,809
in some way because they they thought

00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:25,720
they can't just put this on their

00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:28,179
webpage or or claim something is their

00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:30,220
own but actually it isn't or what the

00:33:28,179 --> 00:33:35,040
common thing is referring to a project

00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:35,040
without mentioning it's from Apache I

00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:42,059
mentioned this briefly in in my founders

00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:45,429
panel statement this morning we have a

00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:47,710
conferences committee it used to be

00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:50,020
actually a normal regular PMC this has

00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:53,650
changed now it's a it's a it's a

00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,790
so-called board committee and the events

00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:57,160
are Apache dork you find more

00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:58,660
information apache Khan is one of the

00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,730
important bits but it's more than a

00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:06,750
Patrick on the the conferences committee

00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:09,820
is about helping people to organize

00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:11,409
events around Apache around the NSF

00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:14,220
around a project that could be a bar

00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:17,200
camp it could be a hackathon a road show

00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:18,580
it's about educating the world about the

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,730
work and the mission of the NSF

00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:25,200
basically and to build that developer

00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:29,080
and user community around these projects

00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,820
and we have a separate committee called

00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:34,000
community development so that's not

00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:37,060
about but focus on a specific project on

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,929
the software development but on the NSF

00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:43,270
and the heirs of community as a whole

00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:47,080
but if the goal is to to believe well

00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:50,139
first of all understand to help you

00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:54,179
understand how the NSF works and to

00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:56,590
provide you with a guidance of how

00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:58,930
contributions can be can be done and how

00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:01,960
to participate etcetera make it make it

00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:03,670
easier for people to to figure out how

00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,310
the NSF works and how a project works

00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:08,230
and how to contribute a fairly new

00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:10,690
committee that we have since I think May

00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:13,000
this year is the diversity and inclusion

00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:14,650
committee I think it's an important

00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,190
topic and we probably need to do better

00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:20,470
in this area but I think one thing we

00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:21,819
don't necessarily know is as David

00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:24,099
nolley actually mentioned this this

00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:26,470
morning as well we may not know where

00:35:24,099 --> 00:35:27,940
the friction actually is so we're

00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:31,180
looking forward to the output of this

00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:33,160
committee to actually yeah

00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:37,180
determine where are the areas where we

00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,569
need to do better and how can we do

00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:40,480
better

00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:44,020
what's the strategy can we provide a

00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,599
framework and guidance around this and

00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,670
advice to the projects and to our

00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:52,720
communities

00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:54,490
I'm always important but kind of like in

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,770
the background and you only care about

00:35:54,490 --> 00:36:00,430
it when it doesn't work is the

00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:03,190
infrastructure so we have service in I

00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:05,230
think three or four different data

00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:10,030
centers in different geographical

00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:10,990
regions and we have a team I forgot

00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,819
actually how many are on the

00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:16,329
infrastructure team but we have a team

00:36:12,819 --> 00:36:19,319
of infrastructure engineers who look

00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:22,119
after all the services that the NSF

00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:25,990
provides and all the services that the

00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:27,760
developers need websites email code

00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:30,700
repositories issue tracking build

00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,349
servers DNS is saturate cetera and so as

00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:34,210
I mentioned before there are some

00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:36,640
volunteers still involved in this but we

00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:39,609
do have paid contractors to make sure we

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:42,160
have always someone 24/7 being available

00:36:39,609 --> 00:36:46,500
we can fix something is something breaks

00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:49,510
or goes down we have a security team

00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,520
Marc Hawkes was in the in the founders

00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:53,859
panel this morning is the VP of the

00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:56,170
security team he he gave a few numbers

00:36:53,859 --> 00:37:00,670
already how many of how many bug reports

00:36:56,170 --> 00:37:04,690
we receive on that on that security at

00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:06,990
Apache dot or email address it's the

00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:10,089
central point of contact for any kind of

00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:12,670
potential vulnerability that someone

00:37:10,089 --> 00:37:16,180
wants to report and share with the NSF

00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:20,650
the actual handling is done by the

00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:24,430
individual PMC's by the individual

00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:27,279
project teams the security team

00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:30,999
just make sure that the the necessary

00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:33,789
information gets forwarded to the

00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:36,519
individual teams and yeah to basically

00:37:33,789 --> 00:37:41,039
poke them if they don't respond to it in

00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:46,119
a in a timely manner some larger teams

00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:48,940
or certain projects have separate

00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:51,599
security at email addresses for example

00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:54,249
the web server Tomcat spam assassin etc

00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:58,059
otherwise we would use that the private

00:37:54,249 --> 00:38:01,619
at email address to base in notify the

00:37:58,059 --> 00:38:03,609
team about here's someone who was

00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:06,279
telling us that there is a potential

00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:10,269
vulnerability it looks like it is valid

00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:13,059
but it's up to the team to to order to

00:38:10,269 --> 00:38:15,519
assess if it is valid if it is a valid

00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:17,859
one or ability report and to actually go

00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:20,430
ahead and fix it provide an update

00:38:17,859 --> 00:38:25,089
provide patches provide a new release

00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:27,490
I'm important I mean it says marketing

00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:29,859
and publicity committee but the ISS

00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:32,249
doesn't really do marketing and in that

00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:35,410
sense it's more about public relations

00:38:32,249 --> 00:38:38,170
it's about handling questions from from

00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:43,210
the press it's about putting out press

00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:45,400
statements and celica dari is it's the

00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:48,210
VP of the the committee and is handling

00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:52,630
this since since a very very long time

00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:57,130
there are different volunteers who help

00:38:52,630 --> 00:39:01,239
with with things like responding to to

00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:06,190
the press and in the portent part is

00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:09,910
that we are very we stress always as we

00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:12,249
abandon you troll we we don't take sides

00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:14,609
in a press statement or in a in a

00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:16,869
release or in a in a statement basically

00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:20,529
it's basically making sure that we have

00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:24,190
this yeah basically safe haven this

00:39:20,529 --> 00:39:28,930
neutral ground where companies who may

00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:30,779
or may not because competing against

00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:32,829
each other on the commercial market

00:39:30,779 --> 00:39:35,460
where the developers can come together

00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:37,790
and contribute to the same project and

00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:41,180
both gaining a benefit

00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:43,610
out of this we cannot do without

00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:45,200
donations as David already mentioned

00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:47,720
this morning we have a fundraising

00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:51,130
committee so they define our sponsorship

00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:54,170
program and we have these various

00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:56,000
sponsor that help us are basically

00:39:54,170 --> 00:40:00,200
having having a budget paying for our

00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:03,290
service paying for our data center costs

00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:07,460
et cetera and paying to some example

00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:10,610
things like the Apache conferences

00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:13,550
events and hackathons you cetera but a

00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:15,650
large part of our donations on a large

00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:17,420
part but a sizable chunk of our

00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:21,050
donations doesn't come from companies

00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:24,260
but from individuals so I find this

00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:27,080
quite quite interesting you can even

00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:31,100
donate to as in Bitcoin these days if if

00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:33,830
that's what you prefer we have a legal

00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:37,670
affairs committee unfortunately we

00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:42,320
cannot ignore legal things in today's

00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:44,750
world and sometimes a project who has

00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,850
legal questions this is basically their

00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:48,320
point of contact so there is a internal

00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:51,500
mailing list but it's also a discussion

00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:53,330
list where legal topics can be can be

00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:56,150
discussed so we have basically pro bono

00:40:53,330 --> 00:41:00,710
lawyers who provide these these service

00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:04,550
typically this brings me to the end of

00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:06,770
my my presentation I think we have time

00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:11,530
for a couple of questions are there any

00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:11,530
any questions yes

00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:45,340
[Music]

00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:03,460
so if so if I understand the question

00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:04,960
correctly its yeah there's obviously

00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:08,080
some of the platinum sponsors are not

00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,840
necessarily open source companies but so

00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:12,880
you're wondering okay like like like

00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:17,470
Amazon yeah obviously wanted to use the

00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:21,010
AWS service and things like that oh yeah

00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:24,610
like with Microsoft and I think the the

00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:26,770
platinum sponsors companies contributed

00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:27,600
for four different reasons sometimes it

00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:30,790
is because they are actually

00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:32,620
participating in project at the ASF but

00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:34,750
sometimes we have companies who simply

00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:36,610
just say well we're using all your

00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:39,100
Apache software and we haven't given

00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:42,070
anything back and we are making no lots

00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:44,170
of money with it and he is like like a

00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:46,630
way for us to to at least give you some

00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:48,550
money we don't contribute in the sense

00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:50,500
of like software development or paying

00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:52,690
developers to come to to work on your

00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:56,170
projects but it's basically a way for

00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:57,850
for them to donate some money so I think

00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:59,560
there's I think my answer would be

00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:01,360
there's there's various reasons why

00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:03,460
these platinum sponsors or code and

00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:06,130
transponders actually pay money to the

00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:11,620
ASL for there's different reasons some

00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:13,870
of them them are open source companies

00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:16,000
or companies who promote open source and

00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:19,440
some of them don't necessarily promote

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,440
open source I think that's

00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:27,880
well as a you cannot donate to a

00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:30,580
specific project you can only donate to

00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,590
the NSF as a whole and the companies

00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:35,320
with a platinum or gold or whatever

00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:36,970
sponsors they cannot decide how that

00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:40,030
money gets used they don't have any

00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:41,940
control the like a sponsor is just

00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:45,100
paying money and that's where it stops

00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:48,340
like as I said members in the foundation

00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:50,140
idividuals a company cannot like give a

00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,530
donation and then expect something in

00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:52,510
return

00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:54,610
I cannot say I've been a platinum

00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:57,130
sponsor for five years now I want you to

00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:58,810
do this that doesn't that doesn't work

00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:01,990
so that's not how this how this works it

00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:05,590
is really just a charitable donation as

00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:06,880
far as we are concerned and to prepare

00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:09,760
some of these companies obviously do

00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,890
that because it's part of their it's

00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,810
it's marketing it's it's being being

00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:16,120
seen as contributing to open source in

00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:20,290
some in some cases and some of the

00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:22,870
companies who are on that list they were

00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:26,770
not even they were against open source

00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:29,050
like 20 years ago so some of these

00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:32,380
companies have have turned around and

00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:33,940
before the scene companies who were seen

00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:37,630
as the the good players in the open

00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:40,540
source area but actually no longer

00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:44,310
really meet that requirement if you know

00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:47,310
what I mean any any more questions

00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:47,310
Denise

00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,870
yeah

00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:20,130
yeah yes basically we I mean Apache we

00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:23,010
depend on the nations but we are a

00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:25,859
charitable organization and we don't

00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:28,319
really pay lobbyists to to run around

00:46:25,859 --> 00:46:31,349
and and and and talk about Apache

00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:33,450
maybe we should but okay I think that's

00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:35,309
what Apache conference isn't for to

00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:38,369
educate the people about how the NSF

00:46:35,309 --> 00:46:41,670
works and making sure that we remain

00:46:38,369 --> 00:46:45,720
neutral we don't want to be seen like

00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:47,640
fighting against companies or doing

00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,349
something but we will do this if there's

00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,819
a reason for this when it comes to the

00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:54,210
Apache License or the software or

00:46:50,819 --> 00:46:56,099
something I think I need to finish my

00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:57,420
presentation if you have any further

00:46:56,099 --> 00:47:01,500
questions I'll be around at the

00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:03,690
conference we have other talks in in

00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:07,099
this district there's also a talk I

00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:09,990
think tomorrow by shane consumer about

00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:11,940
the apache way so I touched on this

00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:14,280
already he's going to go in a bit more

00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:15,960
detail in a separate session tomorrow

00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:18,100
about this so I recommend attending it

00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:21,469
thank you very much

00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:21,469
