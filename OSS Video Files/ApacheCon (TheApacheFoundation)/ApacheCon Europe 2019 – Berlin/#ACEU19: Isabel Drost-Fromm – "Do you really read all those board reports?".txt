Title: #ACEU19: Isabel Drost-Fromm – "Do you really read all those board reports?"
Publication date: 2019-10-29
Playlist: ApacheCon Europe 2019 – Berlin
Description: 
	More: https://aceu19.apachecon.com/session/do-you-really-read-all-those-board-reports

Here’s the challenge:

An agenda with 100 entries.
Some of these needing clarifications, advise, answers to questions.
Some 20 attendees for each meeting.
All of that in a meeting that runs in well under 120 minutes.
That’s roughly what an Apache Board of Directors meeting looks like in 2019.

One of the questions I received most frequently as a director was whether all of us really do read all of those project board reports. This talk is going to give you an answer not only to that question - but will also detail how that meeting is setup so that all of that can be done in a very focused, dense meeting. Hint: It takes a lot of asynchronous preparation and discussion of items. There’s some tooling involved to make things easier to handle. A lot of the magic is based on an understanding that a lot of discussion and decisions can be made on mailing lists before the actual meeting happens though.

Be prepared for a non-fairy-dust presentation of how cleanly separating what can be done asynchronously from what really needs a call to discuss can help with making meetings very effective. How that can help enable participants across the globe to participate. How it can enable volunteers to focus there time and energy where it’s needed.

While there is room for improvement as we grow larger, I do believe the system that’s currently in place in and of itself is already astonishing. A lot of the lessons learnt can be transferred over to other communication contexts and help make meetings more focused.

thank you for the kind introduction it

00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,750
took a little bit of time to get the

00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,880
slides up on here so I already was

00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,710
thinking about doing it without slides

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,439
luckily my husband will see over some

00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:20,380
laptops that works um how many of you

00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:25,060
how many here know about how this whole

00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:28,119
board reporting stuff works half once

00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:31,840
you're at maybe okay good um so where's

00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:34,120
this question comes from when I was new

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,460
gee Apache I had no idea houses entire

00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,890
reporting stuff works when I had my

00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:42,670
first project which was called Apache

00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:44,740
mahute there was this weird timeframe

00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,400
where someone was writing something up

00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:50,020
sending it to your mailing list and then

00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,510
maybe or maybe not some feedback would

00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:55,030
be coming back at some point I realized

00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,890
that all of us the EAS of projects are

00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,829
doing that on a regular basis like on a

00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:03,130
quarterly basis now thinking about how

00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:05,379
many projects there are and thinking

00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:07,780
about them reporting each quarter the

00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:10,210
questions that I asked myself as doozies

00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:13,720
characters really reads the stuff like

00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:15,610
all of them like thoroughly I have been

00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:20,170
a director by now and the answer is

00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:22,690
fairly simple so I can go out now and

00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:26,170
have coffee right but likely you want to

00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:28,450
know how that works first of all the

00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:31,590
disclaimer what I'm going to tell you is

00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:37,090
based on my personal experience from the

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:39,070
period in 2016-17 and in 2018-19

00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,770
depending on who's on the board things

00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:44,950
may be different experiences may be

00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:47,490
different this is mine and as a

00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:50,200
disclaimer a lot of the learnings that

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,750
benefited me when I was a director were

00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,670
based on some things that I heard at my

00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:59,409
very first Apache con well actually it

00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:01,390
was Amsterdam 2008 their batch wrong

00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:04,119
gate gave a talk on asynchronous

00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,490
communication today you can look it up

00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:09,819
on YouTube and watch it yourself

00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:11,920
it's one of see some of the basic

00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:14,459
principles on how Apache projects

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,459
operate

00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:26,959
so quick show of hands how many uses of

00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,870
Apache projects do we have in the room

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,430
and I want to see all hands because if

00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,890
you have a mobile phone likely you're

00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:37,040
using apache software

00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:37,610
how many committees are here so pretty

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,860
much everyone

00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:46,690
how many areas of members okay half how

00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:49,610
many board or formal board members

00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:51,470
okay the two of you could you to keep me

00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:55,730
honest if I'm telling you come

00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:57,440
up on stage and help me thank you so how

00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:02,690
many of you have contributed to any

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,040
board meeting agenda okay one sort of

00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:06,830
roughly half okay

00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,930
so you know what I'll be talking about I

00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,760
will be quickly skipping over the

00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,900
following slides B's haps there will a

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:17,480
patchy way talks previously knowing that

00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:20,739
several of you are at least committers I

00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:23,180
assumes that you know what's really so

00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:27,620
most likely you're using an a as a

00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:30,410
project this project is being developed

00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,209
by a group of people independent

00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:37,220
developers independent contributors

00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:40,250
working together if people who are

00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:42,200
contributors for a long enough or was

00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:46,400
enough commitment they will be called

00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:49,610
commuters for some projects it's

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,910
identical versus out of commuters much

00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:55,250
as Shane explained earlier for sums

00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:58,190
there's a different set or subsets

00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,690
that's being made PMC member PMC

00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,959
actually means project management

00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:04,459
committee but they are not the ones who

00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,920
set project direction and tell people

00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:11,540
what to do so you're the ones providing

00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:13,670
oversight now some of some of the people

00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,190
active in those projects may be members

00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,959
of the foundation itself what does it

00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,489
mean to be a member of the foundation do

00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:24,560
you tell projects what they should be

00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:28,160
doing clearly not what do you do is that

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,990
on a honor you do provide oversight or

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,090
as a foundation but on a regular basis

00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,980
like every 12 months you go ahead and

00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:38,510
vote for a

00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:40,400
of directors so we do have a mission

00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:46,430
statement you and we'll come back to

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:48,950
that later on and so nine directors do

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,780
have several tasks or several things

00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:53,660
that they have to do they have to

00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:57,590
provide as the website says operational

00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:59,510
oversight project oversight they have to

00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:06,560
set direction and manage foundation

00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:09,650
assets so they are responsible for

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,510
oversight what does that mean we will

00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:16,220
dig deeper into the project oversight

00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:18,620
part I've mentioned earlier that each of

00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,600
our projects on a quarterly basis sends

00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,820
project reports to the board

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,390
what does project oversight mean

00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:28,490
projects are pretty much independent

00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:31,090
except when they are not the board will

00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,210
not meddle with technical issues

00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:35,180
asterisk

00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:38,450
unless projects fail to fix or at least

00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:40,850
respond to security issues the board

00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:43,460
will not meddle was how projects run the

00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,380
community unless those projects failed

00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:48,830
to be run in a vendor neutral and open

00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:50,930
way the board will not meddle with legal

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,910
issues except when the board as the

00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:56,920
project's failed to respond to legal

00:05:52,910 --> 00:06:05,150
issues say licensing or trademark issues

00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:09,650
also the where am I so how does that

00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:12,920
work all of those projects sent in

00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:14,690
quarterly reports it's say you're

00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,810
supposed to report not so much on the

00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:20,120
technical side there the focus will be

00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,850
much more like just an explained during

00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,770
the incubate and incubate or talk on how

00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:27,920
the project is being run how well the

00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:30,380
community is doing so some of these

00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,270
directors will dive slightly deeper into

00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,920
project communication pointing out when

00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:38,060
conversations should have happened not

00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:41,060
on a private list but in public now

00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:44,060
remember those nine people if you're in

00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:47,330
a company and the company is small

00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,600
enough chances are satirical located so

00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,430
you

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,680
would schedule a meeting everyone get

00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:56,000
everyone in a room and discuss things

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:58,250
there now when I was a director we had

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,590
people from the u.s. West Coast u.s.

00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,200
East Coast we had people from Europe and

00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:05,300
we had people from Australia getting

00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,560
every one of those interview room every

00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,770
months is pretty much out of the

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,950
question getting any one of those on a

00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:15,020
phone call more than once a month on the

00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,770
volunteer basis also is pretty much out

00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:20,300
of the question

00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:22,400
so how does that work some of these

00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,580
people by the way have dedicated time

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:29,480
for that task say their employer says

00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:31,610
you get a certain amount of time during

00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,650
your working hours to do that let's do

00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:37,700
that on a full three time volunteer

00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:39,950
basis not all of them have the time to

00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:43,580
monitor Ilkka real-time communication

00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:45,500
channels all the time also when we use

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,780
and we would be using real-time

00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,120
communication channels when someone's

00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,850
communicating who lives in the u.s. west

00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,890
coast or east coast it's unlikely

00:07:52,850 --> 00:08:00,710
someone in Australia still asleep so

00:07:54,890 --> 00:08:03,590
they can't participate also see time

00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:06,080
slots that people have to dedicate

00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:08,360
choose those tasks may be different so

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,120
for me personally each week I would

00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:14,360
dedicate a couple hours honestly on a

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,610
specific day in the week in order to do

00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:21,110
these tasks someone else on the board

00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:23,810
would take different time slices what

00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:26,630
are the constraints those people still

00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:28,520
have to coordinate somehow no decision

00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,840
can be taken by one director alone so

00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,700
there has to be some kind of

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:36,349
communication and some kind of consensus

00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:38,510
building in a nutshell that is pretty

00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:40,340
similar to how we run our projects all

00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,410
of the communications is essential

00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:46,100
should be happening on board at Apache

00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:49,190
org that's not public as in Google

00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:51,890
public but every ASF member and at least

00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:56,839
every PMC chair has access to it and can

00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:59,450
participate so this way we do have like

00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:01,010
Oh a coordination medium and a

00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,620
communication medium where we can

00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:05,210
participate asynchronously so

00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,920
essentially Z what didn't happen on a

00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:10,130
mailing list didn't happen still applies

00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:14,030
and was mailing list I want to stress it

00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:18,290
at apaches those are not see emails that

00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:19,760
you know from your day to day work but

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:23,030
it's really mailing lists which are

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,340
being archived which are searchable and

00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:31,640
where you do have stable links to your

00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:33,830
communication there are some issues that

00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,050
won't be discussed on that list mostly

00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:39,830
they relate to people issues like we

00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:42,020
need a new people to new person to fill

00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,580
a certain operations position this is

00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,860
something that you likely you do not

00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,810
want to discuss in front of of 700

00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,840
peoples like the pros and cons of

00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:52,880
specific individuals but other than that

00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:57,170
pretty much everything is available for

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:59,930
oversight 700 members on top of that

00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:02,570
there is a monthly board meeting where

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:06,470
we will go through certain discussion

00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:07,100
items however preparation for that

00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,290
meeting

00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:12,380
happens mostly beforehand and any

00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:15,920
asynchronously now I will show you the

00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:19,070
meeting agenda it's at the right hand

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:22,850
side hands up for how long you think

00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:27,650
that synchronous meeting will take hands

00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:32,090
up if you think it's ten hours and so if

00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:36,590
you think it's five hours hands up if

00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:38,900
you think it's two hours or less okay

00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:41,750
someone participated I do see hands of

00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,460
directors so they know that we can trim

00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,640
that down to less than two hours

00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:50,450
I know people who didn't believe me so

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:53,210
what is on that agenda there are 160

00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:56,080
items 97 of C's need to review and

00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:58,580
approval from at least five directors

00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,130
seventy-five of these require some sort

00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,750
of feedback positive negative question

00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:05,030
whatever

00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:06,500
in addition here is usually at least one

00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,400
or two important decisions on that

00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,350
agenda

00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,910
whereas this lesion isn't obvious so you

00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:13,000
need a bit more of communication

00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,870
happening before you have a solution

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,330
plus there are several

00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:19,760
questions queuing up so how do we get

00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:22,100
through that in less than two hours and

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,839
trust me I want to be history is that in

00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:27,110
less than two hours because in my time

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:30,890
zones at 7:30 p.m. so at some point I

00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:35,000
want to go to bed okay vo goes through

00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:38,930
part by part we have 160 agenda items

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,070
how do you go through them you make some

00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:45,470
available for reading well ahead of time

00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:48,560
so the way it works is that all of the

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:53,029
reports are being handed in at least

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:56,750
hopefully please 3 hours 3 days before

00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:59,990
the meeting if it's like 3 hours like I

00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:02,810
just said it's mostly likely that that's

00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:05,720
going to be rejected likely people will

00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:07,520
read it still but most likely for

00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,830
educational purposes it's going to be

00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:15,460
rejected don't worry

00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:19,520
submit it next time all done fine um a

00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:21,620
couple of years ago I was wondering

00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:25,130
whether these people actually read that

00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:28,120
stuff I was on a PMC of Apache mahout so

00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:32,750
I could legitimately add stuff to the

00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:36,470
report of Apache mahout I believe it was

00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:38,690
in 2013 knocked over November ish where

00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:40,339
I added a line to the report to figure

00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:43,120
out why so these people actually read

00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:48,680
that stuff because I didn't believe it

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:52,220
um I didn't do that during the report

00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:55,490
writing period at Apache mahute because

00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:57,020
I just messed up my schedule so I one

00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:59,870
choose the actual data source out of

00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:02,240
that line and wait it it didn't take

00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:05,209
many hours for me to receive feedback in

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,580
my private email after a couple days

00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:10,100
every single director head apparently

00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:13,250
read that line at the very end of set a

00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:15,050
report and sent me a message back you

00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:18,680
can still check out what that line was

00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:21,110
if you go to the archived reports which

00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,329
are available publicly and try to figure

00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:28,640
out what I added what triggered action

00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:32,270
from every director once they

00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:34,760
things that I hopefully I'm not making

00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:37,580
enemies here if you want to try it out

00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,130
in your personal project and you don't

00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,350
believe me those people are reading try

00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:46,310
adding something you will trigger an a

00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:48,590
reaction also it helps to go through the

00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,750
process of adding something to your

00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:54,440
projects report in order to understand

00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:57,400
the process so I said that there are

00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,750
over 90 reports that need a pre-approval

00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:03,170
how does that work you enable

00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:06,110
pre-approvals so essentially before the

00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:08,840
meeting happens directors are able to

00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:11,450
mark a report as yeah that's good I

00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:14,030
don't have to vote with my voice on that

00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:16,040
side it's good and as soon as there are

00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:18,140
at least five directors who have done

00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,910
that the report won't show up in the

00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:23,090
agenda anymore it won't be discussed

00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:25,880
anymore so really it works there's a

00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:27,920
pretty weapon to face there it does have

00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,800
a nice button which says approve report

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,990
a five people do that it's out unless

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,030
someone clicks a button of this report

00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,860
needs to further discussion which means

00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:41,570
that it's marked as it will appear in

00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:43,610
the meeting agenda so the funny thing

00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:45,740
about this nice little web interface I

00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:49,160
typically read some of those reports

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:52,130
while I was commuting if you go on the

00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:54,950
German subway sometimes you do not have

00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:57,590
connectivity however if this thing is

00:14:54,950 --> 00:15:00,620
offline first so I can go read I can

00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:02,330
submit my pre-approvals and I can check

00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:07,580
them in once I have network connectivity

00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:09,800
again okay what about those where you

00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:12,260
need some kind of feedback with quick

00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,030
discussions again you enable

00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,650
asynchronous communication in order to

00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:19,040
clear questions before the meeting

00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:20,690
actually happens that can happen on

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,710
board at Apache toward org but it also

00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:27,710
can happen in the agenda itself often

00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:29,990
those questions that directors come up

00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,130
with during readings and stuff can be

00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:34,970
cleared before the actual meeting

00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:38,030
happens you can see that annex in a in a

00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:40,250
examples there's a button add comment it

00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:42,200
will appear on the upper right corner so

00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,450
said all of the comments at

00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:48,140
we're already made that are so so being

00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:50,120
visible if you're a PMC chair or you can

00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:53,390
participate and answer those questions

00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,100
right away so that all of those issues

00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:57,920
are out of the way for the meeting

00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,990
itself plus all of this communication is

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,910
being sent to protect private lists of

00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:06,830
the same meeting happened so it's not

00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:08,750
like in transparent so what's at the see

00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,330
tooling la look like forces

00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:13,780
sophisticated meeting

00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:16,070
it sounds like rocket science doesn't it

00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:19,550
actually is the tooling is very tailored

00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:20,890
to what CAS F in said for historical

00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:25,040
reasons

00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:27,950
if this built upon the way this meeting

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,140
was run years ago so how did what kind

00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:33,860
of data base is behind the rep interface

00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:35,690
well as the text file you can go to

00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,240
separation today you can check it out

00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:40,940
you can make your modifications check it

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,260
back in and it will appear so you don't

00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:46,730
have to go through easy weapon interface

00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:48,440
the funny thing is the technology isn't

00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:53,060
what makes a magic happen what makes the

00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,650
magic happen is people making sure that

00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,210
communication happens before the

00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:58,790
meetings that communication happens

00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:01,100
asynchronously so that as little as

00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:05,839
possible makes it into synchronous

00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:07,820
meeting so how does seem a meeting

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,949
itself being run back when I was there

00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,870
it was run through a regular phone call

00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:16,790
you would call in there was a

00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:21,380
back-channel on IRC so any additional

00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:23,660
comments back cheddar jokes funny things

00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:27,020
would be shared on IRC so it's a meeting

00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:30,290
set is on call could focus on the Anzhi

00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:32,390
tasks at hand there is one person

00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:34,370
responsible for running through the

00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:36,470
meeting there's one person as a

00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:39,710
secretary responsible for making notes

00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:42,070
during the meeting that really helps

00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:44,900
those people just keeping people focused

00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:47,870
it also helps was having people on the

00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:50,840
call for whom it's 4:00 a.m. in the

00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:54,390
morning so that everyone else remembers

00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,940
to be very focused on the task at hand

00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:59,070
if you want to check out the weapon

00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,260
deface there's a project called Apache

00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:03,270
whimsy according to your children's

00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,820
books that I have at home which collects

00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:09,080
like 50 strange words from all over the

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:12,350
world whimsy means it's something funny

00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:17,520
something whimsical

00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:19,950
strange through whimsy up at Apache dock

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:23,400
you have access to several foundation

00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:25,620
toolings if you don't like what you see

00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:29,190
patches are welcome you can see the what

00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:32,640
source code on github slash Apache slash

00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:41,340
whimsy so it's available under an apache

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:42,720
license you can even use it yourself so

00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,250
what about the things that go beyond

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,380
project oversight

00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,150
what about see one or two important

00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:56,370
decisions on the agenda how are those

00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:59,160
being handled I found a book set I once

00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:03,840
read which in retrospect explained quite

00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:05,820
a bit of how the ASF works to me so in

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,660
that book it says that in order to drive

00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,520
engagement

00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,430
you should get people involved in the

00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:14,160
decision-making process now at Apache we

00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:18,300
don't talk about just three people we

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,040
talk about more like 700 people so

00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:24,150
typically you would refer back to your

00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:26,070
purpose back to your mission in order to

00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:29,220
align people and in order to bring them

00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:30,690
behind what you want to achieve now

00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,700
remember that we are a community of

00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:35,100
self-interested individuals remember

00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,440
that scratch your own itch so bringing

00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:40,970
people together actually may feel more

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:43,530
like your herding cats kind of exercise

00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:45,750
so as a project levels of purpose as a

00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:47,780
mission of the project as a foundation

00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,010
level it becomes a bit more vague

00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:53,550
however there is a mission to which

00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:56,310
helps us we are there for the public

00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:59,190
good we are there to provide services

00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:01,410
and support for like-minded software

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:07,650
project communities which consists of

00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:10,020
individuals who participate now what are

00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:13,050
the principles that I tried to apply

00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,460
when I was part of C Board of Directors

00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:18,030
when faced with such a discussion

00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:20,970
discussion and decision making so what I

00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:22,800
have learned at CAS F is traditionally

00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:25,200
you can make a decision and then you

00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,790
start a change process at some point

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,990
you're done and you can execute against

00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:32,010
that the other way around you could

00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:34,350
first engage people in the

00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,760
decision-making process come to a

00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:38,250
conclusion of how you want to move

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,470
forward and execute the time typically

00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,150
isn't very much different however you

00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:46,140
get much more valuable feedback in the

00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:48,840
second approach so much like we do in

00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:55,410
software development the goal is to open

00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:58,500
up see the creation process in order to

00:20:55,410 --> 00:21:03,270
pull people in in order to hear other

00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:06,570
voices voices there is a question on how

00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:08,880
far we can push that boundary at the

00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:10,680
foundation level remember there are at

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,620
least 700 people who could potentially

00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:16,020
be subscribed to board at Apache now if

00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:18,180
you have one question in 700 people

00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:22,650
responds that's not gonna scale very

00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:25,980
well hopefully so 600 people will agree

00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:27,020
on one thing maybe even 699 maybe even

00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:30,750
700 people

00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:34,230
what does help is to have people in that

00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:36,240
group on that mailing list who are very

00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:38,670
good at spotting where consensus has

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,650
already been reached being software

00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:43,140
engineers we are very good at debugging

00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:45,510
we were very good at spotting where

00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:47,160
things are still misaligned so what have

00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:49,290
helped me when I was a director was

00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,750
having someone in that group who would

00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:55,680
regularly remind us that wait a minute

00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:57,990
on these 80% 90% we already agree let's

00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,150
focus on the remaining 10% where we

00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:03,750
still have disagreement and where we

00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:05,900
need to move forward so it also helps to

00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:09,840
have a broad set of communication skills

00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:12,780
in order to not let discussions dissolve

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:15,240
into flame wars so it also takes

00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:17,970
skillful moderation and I don't mean

00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:20,220
technical moderation but like see stuff

00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,030
that you learn in soft skills lessons

00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,280
and

00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:29,610
to allow all voices to be heard and in

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:31,320
the integrated one thing I did learn

00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:38,460
though is that engaging people takes

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:40,560
time however what meep what drives me

00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,570
personally is that essentially as a

00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:46,470
leader I'm accountable I am accountable

00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:49,200
to everybody and people can expect that

00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:51,270
I do not only expect what I explain what

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,330
I am doing but also explain why I'm

00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:57,060
doing it if I'm explaining why I get mad

00:22:54,330 --> 00:23:00,000
much better buy-in and people will

00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:03,560
understand where I want to go and why I

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,720
want to go there and hopefully follow me

00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:10,320
now I said that engaging people takes

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:14,430
time there are times when things will

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,380
become to feel overwhelming most likely

00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:19,170
in many cases that's because someone is

00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:21,900
moving too fast or because some issue is

00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:25,140
being moved too fast it helps to slow

00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:27,870
down it helps to intentionally switch

00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:33,960
off and go offline and to ignore that

00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:36,350
stuff at some point maybe if you switch

00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:39,510
off now come back a couple hours later

00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:42,990
reread this email threat it will read

00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:44,850
very much differently you will notice

00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:46,620
some subtleties said you didn't notice

00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:48,510
before and said of some things that you

00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:52,850
can't take back to your projects as well

00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:56,030
if it feels overwhelming just slow down

00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:58,650
switch off and come back later and

00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:00,450
oftentimes when you come back later you

00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:02,930
notice some subtleties that you didn't

00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,930
notice before

00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:12,060
so essentially there is one learning for

00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:15,660
me is that slower decisions lead to

00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:18,120
better results there were times when I

00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:20,670
was very frustrated was how the effort

00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:25,380
was working because it was incredibly

00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:27,120
slow learning for me was that there are

00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,730
times and projects which aren't a good

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,650
fit for the ASF so sometimes it's better

00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:34,620
to move out and still do good for the

00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:37,560
community there maybe just go a

00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:39,120
different path however if you want to

00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:47,010
change something you will have to bring

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:51,570
time with you so at the end of the day

00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:53,880
also Falls those decisions and questions

00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:55,620
where the solution isn't obvious it

00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,750
helps to enable asynchronous

00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,060
communication in order to prepare

00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:01,860
consensus it helps to not have these

00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:05,250
discussions in this synchronous meeting

00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:08,460
but to prepare consensus on this

00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:10,980
asynchronous communication channel so at

00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:16,290
the end of the day this channel should

00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:18,900
be a board at what this needs is people

00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:21,060
who listen actively it needs people who

00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,190
moderate discussions with participants

00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:26,160
with wildly different backgrounds and

00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:29,190
wildly different agendas and girls it

00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:31,050
needs people who know this is how to do

00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:33,780
this kind of moderation in a written

00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:35,580
medium some things that some kind of

00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:39,830
feedback that I got from my colleagues

00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:42,930
at work where I was driving towards more

00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:45,660
written communication was when they were

00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:48,270
watching me during discussions they were

00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:51,720
noticing that the same moderation that

00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:53,520
they do in face-to-face meetings say

00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,310
what recognizance is worth medium as

00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:00,630
well so same kind of stuff still has to

00:25:56,310 --> 00:26:03,150
happen and I need above a note above and

00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:05,700
beyond all that needs people who are

00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:10,530
able to slow down and who allow others

00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:14,910
to slow down now what about those other

00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:16,710
items that are queuing up being a dry

00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:19,660
director sometimes feels like you need

00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:22,880
more than two hands

00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:25,310
it will feel overwhelming there are

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:29,020
always too many things to do at once

00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:31,730
Sara always too many open issues so

00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,920
essentially we'll need to prioritize you

00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:37,760
will need to put your focus on one

00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:41,630
important thing it will means that other

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,370
important things are being left aside so

00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:45,370
plus site so is that you are not alone

00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:48,440
first of all there are nine of you

00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:51,080
second over you of all there are another

00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:54,710
seven hundred experienced members who

00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:57,560
will step up and volunteer so the things

00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:59,840
that I've taken back from my time was

00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:01,940
that you don't have to be a director in

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,860
order to change something or in order to

00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:06,200
do something meaningful or to make a

00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:11,210
very impactful contribution you can do

00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:13,430
that without that title so the

00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:16,310
traditional option in order to get rid

00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:19,160
of these tasks is to tell someone Hager

00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:22,070
had two acts except none of those

00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:24,950
contributing to zsf was a few exceptions

00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:27,950
or being paid to do so so if you do that

00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:30,170
too often or in a way that's not

00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:35,930
persuasive enough people will just go

00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:38,570
and say no sorry won't do it something

00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:41,180
said sometimes works is to use your

00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:43,220
soapbox is to talk about the issues that

00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:47,330
you see and to ask for volunteers to

00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:50,180
become active it also helps to share

00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:51,770
what you're working on early so that you

00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:54,710
can get not only feedback but also

00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:56,900
helping hands apache rimsey itself

00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:59,180
wasn't the deeper being developed by a

00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:03,950
director itself it was someone who

00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:05,960
stepped up in order to help out also it

00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:07,970
makes it easier if you release early and

00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,060
release often and make smaller steps in

00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:13,490
order in in contrast to doing a BIGBANG

00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:15,890
release first of all those steps are

00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:18,230
easier to rollback if if you've made a

00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:20,420
mistake second of all is easier to

00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:23,180
convince 700 people to make a small step

00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:28,190
and to get consensus on that small step

00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:30,110
compared to something very big so

00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:32,170
essentially this reminds me to my work

00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:35,200
that I've been doing in right

00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:37,390
and opens those projects before it means

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,890
inspiring other volunteers to become

00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:46,290
active so this is something that people

00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:46,290
on our projects do on a daily basis so

00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:54,910
with that we are essentially through

00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:57,910
through the entire challenge now if you

00:28:54,910 --> 00:29:00,010
are not a member and if you're not a PMC

00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:02,800
chair where can you see the results

00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:05,920
offset is there a way to check set a

00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:09,700
gender file actually there is all of

00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:12,400
that is being published at the earliest

00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:14,170
one months after the meeting happens so

00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,240
smeeting minutes are being made publicly

00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:19,960
available so you can go through these

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,820
archives they are available I believe up

00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,070
until the time when the foundation was

00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:30,370
created so you can dig into your history

00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:33,820
all the way back so to summarize what do

00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:36,790
you need for such a large agenda to

00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:41,470
shrink down to one to two hours is to

00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:44,800
enable reading before the meeting

00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:46,750
happens is to enable pre-approvals is to

00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,190
enable asynchronous communication in

00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,740
order to clear questions

00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:54,100
it's enable asynchronous communication

00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:56,740
in order to prepare consensus it's also

00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:58,750
in order to inspire volunteers to become

00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:07,330
active and first that I'm open for

00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:12,010
questions and Corrections just won't

00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:13,960
were you since Apache is all about

00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:16,270
community and all about family I will

00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,460
simply ask the easy question of so how

00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:25,330
is your six-year-old doing she's sitting

00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:27,040
up there so the reason why he knows that

00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:28,690
I have a six year old is that she was

00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:32,530
attending pretty much every board call

00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:37,080
when I was a director that's possible as

00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:37,080
well any other questions

00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:51,070
Denyce as you know I recruited you onto

00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:53,440
the board of the inner source Commons

00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:56,740
because I want to graph this this idea

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,930
to them but I noticed I mean we know

00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:02,230
there's not a lot of turnover typically

00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:04,350
an Apache board right the sort of the

00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:06,580
same people serve over and over again a

00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:08,320
little bit right I mean there's

00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:10,780
occasionally there's a new person or two

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,100
but generally it's been the case that

00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:14,860
it's the same people over and over again

00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:17,170
so those people are burnt into this way

00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:19,600
of working but do you find you have

00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:21,790
onboarding for new board members to get

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,880
them to realize what the time commitment

00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:27,700
is so that this can work there's in form

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,260
of onboarding when I became a board

00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,750
member I had no clue how that worked

00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:34,630
honestly I hadn't participated in any of

00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:38,080
support calls before so what we did was

00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:41,260
to have those new board members who

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:44,890
could make it to a call said it was out

00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:46,750
of schedule we also had some of the

00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:48,940
regular participants who could make it

00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:52,210
like not everyone and then we went

00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:54,580
through a I believe it was the agenda of

00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:57,370
the previous months where the tooling

00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:59,530
was being shown where dial and was being

00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:03,130
tried where the back-channel was being

00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:06,730
shown and it kind of sort of was like a

00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:09,220
real meeting but there was time for

00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:11,200
questions asking several time for jokes

00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:16,090
and there was time for getting people

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:18,160
into that what also happens if if there

00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:22,090
is time on the schedule of the board

00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:24,670
members is at the beginning of the term

00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:27,100
to get everyone really together in one

00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:29,890
room and have a meal together so that

00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:33,340
you know who's speaking for me I had it

00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:35,830
easier than other newcomers because even

00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:40,750
though I hadn't been active that much I

00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:43,690
knew everyone's face I also received a

00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:47,260
very helpful email where people were

00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:49,870
explaining to me how people operate and

00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:52,509
what their values look like I was like I

00:32:49,870 --> 00:33:00,609
know these people already but thank you

00:32:52,509 --> 00:33:02,979
but that was really helpful rich also in

00:33:00,609 --> 00:33:04,329
years when we have a large turnover in

00:33:02,979 --> 00:33:08,979
board members we do have an in-person

00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:10,449
meeting this year we had a meeting in

00:33:08,979 --> 00:33:13,269
Chicago because we had a very large

00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:14,769
turnover and everybody was I think

00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:17,109
everybody was present yeah and we were

00:33:14,769 --> 00:33:19,690
we were able to do a sample meeting

00:33:17,109 --> 00:33:21,399
there as well and there's also a

00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:25,919
discussion going on right now on the

00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:28,209
board list about having sort of

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,619
mentoring of people that we might want

00:33:28,209 --> 00:33:31,839
to nominate someday as a board member

00:33:29,619 --> 00:33:34,149
and having them sit in on meetings and

00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:35,979
and kind of have a ride-along so that

00:33:34,149 --> 00:33:38,889
they are more familiar with that process

00:33:35,979 --> 00:33:41,229
in the event that they're elected so one

00:33:38,889 --> 00:33:43,479
thing that I was doing when I was a

00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:45,849
board member every time we had a new PMC

00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:48,339
chair I would write an email to them

00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:48,969
like come to the board meeting it looks

00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:51,759
scary

00:33:48,969 --> 00:33:53,799
it looks boring dial-in first of all

00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:56,109
it's not scary because you know these

00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:58,809
people second of all it won't take a ton

00:33:56,109 --> 00:34:01,599
of your time believe me I know you don't

00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:04,929
believe me but believe me and beautiful

00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:07,149
yes it will be fun believe me it's not a

00:34:04,929 --> 00:34:09,819
regular like corporate meeting where

00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:12,250
people run through it roughly half

00:34:09,819 --> 00:34:14,740
accepted that offer because even if you

00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:16,599
are a new PMC chair it helps to

00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:18,609
understand the process and it helps to

00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:21,819
understand what directors look for in

00:34:18,609 --> 00:34:23,829
those reports it's one of the reasons

00:34:21,819 --> 00:34:25,450
why I submitted this talk at Apache Con

00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:27,669
and why I'm very grateful for the

00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:29,230
cameras there in the back because I want

00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:37,289
to make it more transparent and more

00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:37,289
visible of how that works anything else

00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:45,090
so so partly response to echo it rich

00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:46,980
was saying we've done a lot of work in

00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:48,720
terms of the board thinking about how to

00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,850
make people understand what what things

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,560
are happening the other point is please

00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:54,540
ask especially if you're an Apache

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,740
member who might be thinking about

00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:58,440
whether or not you'd want to do this

00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:00,930
please step up and ask either on the

00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,790
board list or ask one of us everybody in

00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:04,820
the board is happy to talk to any member

00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:08,760
about how it works what it really means

00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:10,980
and to help them I'll ask you so what

00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,080
what was the most surprising thing about

00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,910
being a director that you found that

00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,440
that you wouldn't have thought of

00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:23,340
beforehand and afterwards you're like oh

00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:25,140
wow it was not one most surprising thing

00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:27,030
actually the most surprising thing was

00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:30,270
when I was not a director and when I

00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:34,170
added this one line and really literally

00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:37,110
all nine came back I didn't believe that

00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:40,400
these people would read all of that that

00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:40,400
was the most surprising thing actually

00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:49,140
also one thing about onboarding the

00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:51,750
Newseum mentioned said those on the

00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:53,700
board at Apache know know how that works

00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:56,040
most of the principles that I've been

00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:58,680
talking about I already knew through our

00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,950
projects so it wasn't all that different

00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:10,550
it was just different questions

00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:13,850
essentially anyone

00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:16,220
I don't want to stand between you and

00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:25,910
your flight home or your cup of coffee

00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:28,790
or dinner hello in our project we think

00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:33,890
about helping our chair to write bot

00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:38,060
reports and so what totally do so yeah

00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:41,360
but my question is what do you like to

00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:44,780
read there is a template that you can

00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:47,210
use in order to bootstrap it the stuff

00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:52,280
set me personally I've been focusing on

00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:54,890
is how does the community operate are

00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:59,210
you healthy do you need help every

00:36:54,890 --> 00:37:04,820
everything okay for you serious to more

00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:06,170
directors at your feedback Shane so as

00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,180
the director and I think could speak for

00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:10,250
many other ones there we have a reporter

00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,780
tool reported out apache2 org that has

00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:13,460
sort of a framework and there's a new

00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:17,210
version that asks a few questions and

00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:19,730
then collect statistics and then prompts

00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:22,310
you to think about what your project is

00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:25,040
done so what I value most in in a

00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:27,080
typical board report is can I see from

00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,910
the human writing that somebody's

00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,620
actually thought about what the project

00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:31,040
did in the past three months and explain

00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:34,010
it to me

00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:35,770
even briefly but simply having a list of

00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:38,030
releases and the new commuter names

00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:40,940
that's not interesting you you just push

00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:42,500
the button and reporter saying oh we got

00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,540
together and decided on a new module

00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,400
this year and then we're really hoping

00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:48,410
to switch to time-based releases next

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,630
year somebody thought about it and wrote

00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:52,700
about that and talked about the

00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:54,580
community making decisions getting

00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:57,710
things done maybe having problems

00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:59,240
another key point is if if there is some

00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:00,890
problem that you feel you're not quite

00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:04,820
sure about the project's deciding things

00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:07,970
or whatever let the board know I think

00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:10,100
one of the biggest things is surprising

00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:12,260
the board after the fact or not

00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:14,270
mentioning a problem and letting it

00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,810
fester and having the board find out

00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:17,360
about it

00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:19,850
those are really bad things we don't

00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:22,880
like being surprised we want to hear as

00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:23,960
with the meaning we want to hear what's

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,570
happening ahead of time or even

00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,490
just concerns at a time there are some

00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:30,320
projects we'll say we have an issue

00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:32,180
statement we say you know we don't have

00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,130
any issues but we are tracking this

00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:37,820
question and we're going to figure it

00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:40,849
out that happens great right and even if

00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:42,080
it blows up next month I can say oh you

00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:45,290
know they were already thinking about it

00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:47,089
no problem something blows up and then

00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,470
later the project says oh we were

00:38:47,089 --> 00:38:52,150
thinking about this well that doesn't

00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:54,790
help us as much so as much as much human

00:38:52,150 --> 00:39:00,410
thought into saying here's what we did

00:38:54,790 --> 00:39:03,339
is the best thing I think one thing I

00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:05,570
want to add to that is that I like

00:39:03,339 --> 00:39:08,480
during that report you're supposed to

00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:11,300
cover is three months there is a bias

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,640
and recency when writing that thing just

00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:15,950
before the meeting happens what I've

00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:18,020
seen some people some projects do is to

00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:20,119
have like a wiki page or in their

00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:23,089
version control system a specific file

00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:24,440
where they collect significant stuffs

00:39:23,089 --> 00:39:26,900
that they want to mention in say an

00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:33,550
export report so that makes it easier to

00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:37,040
then write it any other questions

00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:40,080
otherwise thank you for your time and

00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:45,840
have a safe trip home

00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:45,840
