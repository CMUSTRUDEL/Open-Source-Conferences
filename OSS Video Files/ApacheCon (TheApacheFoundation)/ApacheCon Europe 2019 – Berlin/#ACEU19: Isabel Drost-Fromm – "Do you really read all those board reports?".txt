Here’s the challenge:

An agenda with 100 entries.
Some of these needing clarifications, advise, answers to questions.
Some 20 attendees for each meeting.
All of that in a meeting that runs in well under 120 minutes.
That’s roughly what an Apache Board of Directors meeting looks like in 2019.

One of the questions I received most frequently as a director was whether all of us really do read all of those project board reports. This talk is going to give you an answer not only to that question - but will also detail how that meeting is setup so that all of that can be done in a very focused, dense meeting. Hint: It takes a lot of asynchronous preparation and discussion of items. There’s some tooling involved to make things easier to handle. A lot of the magic is based on an understanding that a lot of discussion and decisions can be made on mailing lists before the actual meeting happens though.

Be prepared for a non-fairy-dust presentation of how cleanly separating what can be done asynchronously from what really needs a call to discuss can help with making meetings very effective. How that can help enable participants across the globe to participate. How it can enable volunteers to focus there time and energy where it’s needed.

While there is room for improvement as we grow larger, I do believe the system that’s currently in place in and of itself is already astonishing. A lot of the lessons learnt can be transferred over to other communication contexts and help make meetings more focused.
