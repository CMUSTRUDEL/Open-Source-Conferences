In this talk I will highlight our experience with the Usability Lab program from Open Tech Fund and how FOSS projects can apply and receive design help from this Lab.

This program offers help with Usability Audits, Usability and User Experience (UX) Consultations, Usability Testing, User Research and User Studies, UX Design and Style Guides.

Two successful examples that will be unfolded are our work on the Briar Project and Thunderbird, the difficulties we encountered and how we managed to overcome them.
