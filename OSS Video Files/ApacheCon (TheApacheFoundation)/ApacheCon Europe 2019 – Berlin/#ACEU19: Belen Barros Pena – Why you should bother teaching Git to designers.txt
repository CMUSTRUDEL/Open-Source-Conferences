	Full title: The art of patience or Why you should bother teaching Git to designers

While I was working as the only designer of the Yocto Project, the embedded Linux engineers in my office did something remarkable. They mustered the patience and the energy to teach Git to yours truly. They did it in stages: they started by how to clone a repository and how to check out its branches, taught me about remotes and how to create my own branches, how to commit my changes, and the etiquette of good commit messages. One glorious day, they decided I was ready to push to a remote repository. By golly I felt powerful. I had mastered Git's mysteries!

Becoming familiar with Git's basic concepts and commands took the best part of 2 years, but it was worth every minute. As a designer, learning Git made me more resilient, more independent and more useful to my development team. In short: a better designer.

In this talk, I will try to convince developers that they should invest time and effort in teaching Git to the designers they work with, what they have to gain from it, and how to go about it.

thank you so much for coming to this

00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:14,830
talk I'm very aware of the fact maybe if

00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:16,360
these lights were to come up ah I'm very

00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,810
aware of the fact that we're almost at

00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,849
the end of the conference so and you're

00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,730
probably all exhausted for the past few

00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:26,770
days and dying to go get a drink outside

00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:30,279
and something to eat I will do my best

00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:31,920
to try and keep you awake but I cannot

00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:34,600
promise you anything

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,309
thank you for coming to this talk which

00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,910
I can't stop thinking it is a bit of a

00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:42,730
strange talk because is about something

00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:46,000
that is very important to software

00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:49,030
development which is version control but

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,760
is from the perspective of a designer so

00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:54,880
what the hell is this about

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,960
before I start I would like to apologize

00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:01,210
profusely to any designers in the room

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,299
because I do know that some of the

00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:06,130
things I'm gonna say might be slightly

00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:08,950
controversial but I want you to keep in

00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:14,500
mind that everything I'm going to say is

00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:17,110
from the deepest understanding and the

00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:21,130
deepest empathy with designers in the

00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:24,100
room because I am a designer myself I am

00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:27,670
an interaction designer and to explain

00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,790
to you what interaction design is I need

00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:34,270
to I need to introduce you to someone

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:37,690
this venerable looking man was sadly

00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:40,240
Bill Moggridge Bill Moggridge was an

00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:43,150
industrial designer he was one of the

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,060
founders of a very famous industrial

00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:49,180
design company called ideal and he's

00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:51,930
also credited with another bill bill

00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:55,960
Verplank with coining the term

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:58,990
interaction design back in the 1980s and

00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,970
what the bills meant by interaction

00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:04,210
design was actually quite simple

00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:06,670
it was the applications of application

00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:10,299
of methods and approaches of industrial

00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:12,700
design to suffer when industrial

00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:15,969
designers start thinking about a new

00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:18,290
product a new physical thing they start

00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:20,540
by thinking first and foremost up

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:24,189
the people who are going to use that

00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:28,879
thing what are they going to use it for

00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:31,219
my and so interaction designers inherit

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,530
this tradition and so we look at

00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:37,790
software from the perspective of the

00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:40,430
people who use it we worry about why

00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,470
people use the software what are the

00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,680
problems they're trying to solve with it

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:48,409
what is it that you're trying to J in

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,430
which context and circumstances they're

00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:56,599
using that software and why they decide

00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:59,689
to use it because as interaction

00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:02,750
designers we are not responsible for

00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:05,900
building software that works that is the

00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:08,480
responsibility of software engineers but

00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:11,450
we are responsible for building software

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:15,019
that makes sense to the people who use

00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:18,859
it and you may have noticed that I've

00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:23,000
said I haven't said software that is

00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:26,419
easy to use I've said software that

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,079
makes sense to the people who use it and

00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:32,900
I do that very much on purpose because

00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:38,599
there are some things out there that can

00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:45,079
never be made simple a gift and version

00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:48,530
control is one of them this is the story

00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:54,319
of how an interaction designer managed

00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:56,389
to learn get I will not have a list of I

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,609
don't have I mean I'm gonna tell you

00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:00,440
story of how I managed to learn it but

00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:03,470
doesn't mean that that is the only way

00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,659
of learning it or that is that way of

00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:08,060
teaching it it's gonna work for all

00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:10,549
designers I don't have a bag of magic

00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:13,329
tricks for you not even a set of best

00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:16,489
practices I have only my personal

00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:20,539
experience to share with you no more no

00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:22,550
less and the reason why I bother to come

00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:25,580
here today with this talk is because I

00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:28,969
really want all software engineers out

00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:31,330
there to bother pitching gate to every

00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:34,789
designer Dana

00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:37,190
and if I manage to convince you you will

00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:39,500
all find yourself yourselves in the

00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:43,340
position of having to teach get to a

00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:47,030
designer and brace yourselves because it

00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:50,000
is not easy this is a story in three

00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:53,180
parts I'm going to tell you first how I

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,210
learned it then I'm going to tell you

00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,919
why I think you should teach get to

00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:01,460
designers and why I think designers

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:04,069
should bother learning it and finally I

00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,440
will utterly embarrass myself by

00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:11,360
confessing to you all how long it took

00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:14,930
me to learn get are you ready yeah right

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,289
so let's start with how I first came

00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:20,719
across get about eight years ago when I

00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:22,789
became the designer of something called

00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:24,919
the doctor project and the job the

00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:27,590
project is a project that is under the

00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:31,430
umbrella of the Linux Foundation and it

00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:33,710
is a set of tools for creating and

00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,419
maintaining customized Linux

00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:39,830
distributions for embedded devices

00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:42,740
between them a build system the first

00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:46,969
time I heard this sentence I don't think

00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:49,340
I understood any single word of it apart

00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:51,889
from the articles and the prepositions I

00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,199
didn't know what they looks was I didn't

00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:56,090
know what a distribution was I didn't

00:05:54,199 --> 00:06:00,770
know what an embedded device was a

00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:04,719
Nabeel system no idea right so imagine

00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:07,909
the picture middle manager in big

00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:10,819
technology corporation approaches Linux

00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:12,889
engineer and says to him hey here is

00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:15,680
this designer she doesn't have a clue

00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:20,349
about what it is you do but she's good

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:23,690
she's here to help you yeah whatever

00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:26,210
that's what I would have thought luckily

00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:29,330
for me this linux engineer didn't think

00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:32,990
that at all he his name was full adult

00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:36,080
um and he was a very special man

00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,879
he didn't think here right whatever he

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,570
thought the job the project could do

00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:45,200
with all the help that came its way

00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:48,320
including the help of our designer so he

00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:51,410
proceeded to try and teach me as much

00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:56,060
about the yoga project as I was able to

00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:59,150
take in one of my jobs inside the doctor

00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:02,380
project was designing and helping build

00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:04,820
a web interface for their build system

00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:08,530
imagine like something like github and

00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:12,350
get lab and for a Linux build system and

00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:14,630
after a few months of research on some

00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,760
design work we started to built to build

00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:19,700
this thing and I really needed to keep

00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,800
track of the progress we were making and

00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,020
make sure that the implementation was

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:29,180
much in the design work but we had done

00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:31,940
before the job the project it lit deals

00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,430
with Linux things and so it borrows a

00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:37,280
lot of processes and methods and tools

00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:39,710
from the Linux kernel project and one of

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,360
them is skit for version control and

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:44,750
this is how things worked

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,750
roughly software developers worked off

00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,940
out of work-in-progress branches that

00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,980
were rebased that were based on the

00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,020
master branch and they were work on

00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,720
these working bridges project branches

00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,850
until they felt that there had some work

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,100
that they wanted to submit for review so

00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:03,080
they create a set of patches send them

00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,580
to a mailing list that would be reviewed

00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,550
by the rest of the contributors or the

00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:10,250
project uneventful II merged back into

00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:13,640
the master branch I'm sure you're all

00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:17,000
familiar with this kind of thing before

00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:19,730
I learned it if I wanted to check any of

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,460
the changes that people were making to

00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:24,860
the web interface or any of the patches

00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:28,040
that were being submitted to the mailing

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,170
list I had to ask one of the software

00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,960
engineers that were working with me if

00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:34,610
they could pull the changes and run an

00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,010
instance of the web application

00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:40,880
including those changes so I could check

00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:44,690
it that was a real pain in the ass for

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,060
me mostly because I knew I was an even

00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,910
bigger pain in the ass for the engineers

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:53,690
that worked with me they were super busy

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:55,370
people and yet every time I wanted to

00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,620
check something which was pre muscle

00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:00,110
pretty much all the time they had to

00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,900
stop whatever they were doing and they

00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:05,390
need to tear up this thing for me

00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,890
sure it wasn't that much work but well

00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,940
you get interrupted all the time with

00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,860
this thing and you don't have the

00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,290
resources to automate the workflow he

00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,600
can become really annoying yet so one

00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:16,870
then understandably these software

00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,160
engineers got sick of it they got fed up

00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:22,100
but instead of telling me to go away and

00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:27,620
stop bothering me they decided to teach

00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:29,750
me how to do it and this is the first

00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:34,990
interesting thing about how I learnt it

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:38,150
I learned it on a need-to-know basis

00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:41,360
basically I was taught whatever I need

00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:45,140
to know at any given time in order to do

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,300
my design work better this is full adult

00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,980
of explaining these himself I wasn't

00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,110
really giving you a training course I

00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,330
was just helping you to get any work

00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,370
done like you know if I kind of flooded

00:09:53,330 --> 00:10:00,920
you with all this it's like day one

00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:03,020
let's let's do a rebase you know like so

00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,110
I think you I think it probably really

00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:10,580
does help having someone to guide you

00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:12,080
through that step by step and you

00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,450
disobeyed me you can just cut to the

00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,850
what what's important you know how do we

00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:18,200
actually use this do you think useful

00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:21,470
how do you actually use these to do

00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,779
something useful this is the key so if

00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:26,029
you are facing with the challenge of

00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:28,430
teaching Gita to a designer just teach

00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:30,050
them on a need-to-know basis just teach

00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:32,390
them whatever it is that they need to

00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:36,650
know at any point in time to do their

00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:38,690
job better and more independently and at

00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:41,779
that time this is what the developers to

00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:44,830
me Belem we have a special place where

00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:48,020
we keep all our work in progress okay

00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:50,450
you need to make a local copy of this

00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:52,610
special place and in order to do that

00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:57,380
you need to write this on a terminal

00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:58,850
window belen in this special place there

00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,730
is a list of things that are called

00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:03,980
branches what you need to do is to

00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:06,260
choose our changes by the way will be

00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,430
one of them one of these branch thingies

00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,890
and you need

00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:12,260
to choose the right one in your local

00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:15,290
copy of the special place and to do that

00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:18,140
you have to type this in a terminal

00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:22,070
window and then this is how you run the

00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:24,709
web application okay obviously I was

00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:27,589
cloning a repository and checking out of

00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:30,500
ranch but the developers didn't tell me

00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:32,330
these they didn't explain to me what a

00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,010
Reaper was didn't explain to me what a

00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:36,860
branch was they just told me this is

00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:41,120
what you do they explain things to me in

00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:43,430
ways I could understand and this is the

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,810
second great thing and that they did

00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:46,370
that I'd like to share with you if

00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:49,700
you're faced with the challenge of

00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:53,740
teaching it to a designer just avoid the

00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:56,270
heat jargon heat has a tonne of jerk

00:11:53,740 --> 00:12:01,220
absolutely all of it is completely

00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:04,910
uncomfortable to non get people it is

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:08,089
also very off-putting to sum up it

00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:10,910
scares the bejesus out of you so just

00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:15,610
don't use it don't bother too much with

00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:19,520
it I'm so glad of hearing that

00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:20,959
and just you know it just is trying to

00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:26,450
explain things in ways that people can

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:29,480
understand after I learn how to check

00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:31,700
out a branch I had to be able to update

00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,800
that branch because these were working

00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:36,740
progress branches so people were kept on

00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,570
pulling pushing changes to them so I

00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,480
needed to be able to update update them

00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:43,820
so the developers told me not to do that

00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,830
I had to do this link will get pool and

00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,089
a few months later they changed their

00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:51,500
mind and they told me to the good

00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:53,150
stretch okay you know they never

00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,370
explained to me what was the difference

00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:57,560
between these two things or why they

00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,250
decided to change their minds and you

00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,610
know what

00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:05,209
I didn't bother asking either because

00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:07,850
the truth is the island here as a

00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:10,310
designer I don't care about all the

00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:12,260
intricacies about version control I

00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:15,890
don't care about the differences between

00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:20,310
fetching and pulling I just do you skate

00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:22,470
on a need-to-know basis okay

00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:25,529
don't bother too much with the concepts

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:27,480
particularly at the beginning because

00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:30,269
probably people are not going to

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,970
understand them anyway if you try and

00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:35,610
teach them the good concepts they are

00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:39,120
very abstract and the they are very hard

00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:41,160
to learn like out cold instead of trying

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,769
to teach them all at the same time do

00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:47,100
you let your designers learn the

00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:49,110
concepts progressively as they use heat

00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,899
as they do things with get this is a

00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:55,319
slower way to learn but it's also a much

00:13:51,899 --> 00:14:00,480
more resilient and long-lasting way to

00:13:55,319 --> 00:14:03,329
learn after that the next thing I wanted

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,579
to do as a designer was meeting tiny

00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:07,079
patches I wanted to fix the small things

00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,740
in the web interface that weren't quite

00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:10,199
alright

00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:12,629
like pixel alignment things or you know

00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:14,160
typos silly things like that and in

00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:17,939
order to do that I had to learn a whole

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:21,660
bunch of new stuff I had to learn how to

00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:24,120
create a branch I had to learn how to

00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:28,470
commit my changes and very importantly

00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,750
how to write good commit messages if I

00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,519
learned how to create a branch I had to

00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:36,420
learn how to delete it with which by the

00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:39,089
way took me ages to do I had a chair how

00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,860
to change and commit just in case I made

00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:43,110
a typo in the commit message or just I

00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:46,019
did something completely wrong and

00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:49,649
finally I had to learn how to push my

00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:53,399
changes to our remote repository this

00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:54,269
was a lot to learn so every time I need

00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,670
to learn something new

00:14:54,269 --> 00:15:01,529
pull Eggleton would come and sit down

00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:03,300
with me and do things with me so he

00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:05,370
would say well and this is what you do

00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,569
first you type this and I was and then

00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:09,949
you type this other thing I never type

00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:14,490
it right but he didn't do things for me

00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:16,199
he did things with me I had to do all

00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,879
the things myself he was just directing

00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:20,189
me and helping me as I went along and

00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:23,129
this is incredibly important to the way

00:15:20,189 --> 00:15:25,019
I learned as well because keith is so

00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:27,899
complicated that it is impossible to

00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:29,309
learn by observation only it's almost

00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:32,490
like you have to develop muscle memory

00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:34,130
and a way to develop muscle memory is to

00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:37,790
type in the command

00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:42,860
yourself so never do things for your

00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:43,940
designers you do things with them now if

00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,800
you're gonna take the trouble to

00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:48,110
actually sit down with your designers

00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,600
and do things with them what you're

00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:54,139
aiming for is to having to explain these

00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,240
things only once the designer you need

00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:58,880
to put the best of themselves to try and

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,560
understand these on the first go so you

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,959
don't have to repeat yourself over and

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,320
over again and the best way of doing

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,910
that is to take notes right so if you

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,589
sit down with your designer and they

00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,000
don't have pen and paper with them which

00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:14,029
is weird because the signers most of the

00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,740
time do tell them to go get some okay

00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:17,990
and then encourage them to keep a cheat

00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:20,630
sheet where they can keep their notes on

00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:23,570
how to do certain stuff and this is an

00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:26,750
image from mine which very originally it

00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:29,600
was called useful things right

00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:32,720
I learned loads of other things after

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,910
this I learned how to initialize a local

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,140
directory is a git repository I learned

00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:41,480
how to set up remotes I learned how to

00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:44,360
reset branches super useful I learned

00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:47,089
how to create patches and how to apply

00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,800
patches how to use git send email to

00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:51,170
send those patches to a mailing list I

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,079
learned how to rebase and even how to

00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:59,779
fix conflicts oh my goodness

00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:03,199
but by then something had changed I had

00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:04,970
grasped the basic concepts of git and so

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,250
no longer needed the developers to

00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:09,589
explain everything to me I could go on

00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:12,919
the web and search for stuff I learn

00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:15,799
things by myself using stack of overflow

00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:18,799
or DITA ACF SCM all these things that

00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:22,819
are available out here so I had become

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:25,189
an independent get learner as your

00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:27,079
designers reach this point you will have

00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:29,510
to spend less and less time with them

00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:32,120
explaining them things when your

00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:34,540
designers reach this point you can sit

00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:37,010
down and relax

00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:40,270
congratulations you have managed to

00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:43,250
teach get to a designer snow mean feet

00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:46,850
now you may have noticed that all along

00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:48,110
these people taught me how to do things

00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:52,280
from the command

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:55,520
I have no idea why they decided to do

00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:58,850
these this way but I immensely grateful

00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,610
that they did they could have taught me

00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:03,500
instead how to use any of their very

00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:06,230
many graphical user interfaces that

00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:10,940
exist forget but instead they taught me

00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:12,230
their commands and the reason why I'm so

00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,810
thankful that they did this is because

00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:16,430
before learning it with them I had tried

00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:18,320
to use some of those graphical user

00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:22,150
interfaces for kids and I was completely

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:27,650
incapable they made no sense whatsoever

00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:31,190
to me this is why oh this is because all

00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:34,810
get graphical user interfaces expose

00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:38,360
what we call the system model of git and

00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:41,540
therefore it is impossible for people

00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:44,510
who do not know gate to understand them

00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:46,940
let me explain what I mean if you speak

00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:49,070
to usability people they will tell you

00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:52,190
that graphical user interfaces should

00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:54,590
not reflect the way the system really

00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:58,760
works that's what they call the system

00:18:54,590 --> 00:19:02,780
model they should reflect the way people

00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:06,560
think the system works and that's what

00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:11,270
they call the mental model mental models

00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:14,210
are often inaccurate and incomplete but

00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:17,540
they work they work in the sense that

00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:22,100
allow us to do things without having to

00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:24,290
know everything about everything the

00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,150
general recommendation in design is that

00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:29,930
your graphical user interfaces should

00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:33,050
match and conform to the users mental

00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:36,620
model and in general I think this advice

00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:39,110
is poor on it works quite well for most

00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,700
things particularly for simple things or

00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:44,090
silly things like washing machines or

00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,380
buying books on the Internet the problem

00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:48,980
is that I'm not sure this works with

00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:51,410
geat at all you see people who do not

00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,990
use scaped do not have a mental model of

00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:57,110
get why would they they never used it

00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:58,940
for anything and software developers

00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,559
don't really have a mental model about

00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,019
it either

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:06,110
because it is their job to understand

00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:08,509
the system model and so there is no

00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:12,200
mental model that good graphical user

00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:14,840
interfaces can actually conform to and

00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,120
if you look at them they all of them

00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,370
reproduce this and expose the system

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,559
model of gait they all organize their

00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:25,129
content in repositories and they talk

00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:27,230
about commits branches and clones and so

00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:28,460
on and so forth if you don't know get

00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:33,190
and you don't know what these things

00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:36,350
mean this interface is unusable to you

00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:38,179
so that's why you need to teach your

00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:40,610
designers how to the things on the

00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:42,559
command line because whilst they are

00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:45,169
founders to the fundamentals they'll be

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:48,200
able to go and use any of their

00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:52,129
graphical user interfaces forget without

00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,509
any problem whatsoever right and it

00:20:52,129 --> 00:20:55,759
doesn't matter how much they complain

00:20:53,509 --> 00:21:01,970
about this you still teach them big mile

00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:05,929
line way ok so this is how I learned get

00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:08,809
the question is why and why should

00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:11,330
designers learn it and why should

00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:13,429
software engineers teach get to people

00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:16,039
well I put the section name mostly

00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:21,710
because Paul told me to I guess patience

00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:24,499
really important to it yeah just to help

00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:26,539
help help the person to understand why

00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:29,389
this is important why why should you

00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:32,179
learn how to use this tool why should

00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:36,619
you learn how to use this tool well at

00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:39,619
this point I have bad news for you it is

00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:42,049
very possible that before you can teach

00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:44,210
get to a designer you will have to

00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:48,559
convince the designer in the first place

00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:49,879
that they should learn it and I've put

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,399
this content in here to try and give you

00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:55,039
the arguments and to try and convince

00:21:52,399 --> 00:21:56,960
them you see there are lot of designers

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,659
out there who genuinely believe that

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:04,249
learning things like version control is

00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:08,210
not part of their jobs I humbly and very

00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:09,619
respectfully disagree designers don't

00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,840
need to know everything there is to know

00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:14,149
about version control or gate designers

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,840
in the same way do not need to know how

00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:16,850
to write for the

00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:20,210
shoe quality code but they absolutely

00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:23,690
need to know enough about suffer in

00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:27,610
order to make sound design decisions

00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:31,520
why because suffer is their design

00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:33,590
material you see if you look at product

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,170
designers right the people who make

00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:38,870
design and make physical products these

00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:42,380
people have loads of materials at their

00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:45,560
disposal they have food and glass and

00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:49,100
ceramics and all sorts of plastics they

00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:51,310
have a marginal cloth and you know stuff

00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,540
like that loads of things they could use

00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:56,180
product designers don't need to know

00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:57,950
everything there is to know about these

00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:00,170
materials they don't need to be material

00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:00,530
scientists but they absolutely need to

00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,440
know

00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:06,080
enough about those materials in order to

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,800
make some design decisions about which

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,510
ones they should use in their products

00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,850
if you're an interaction designer or

00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:17,420
you're a graphic designer creating

00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:22,850
assets for software suffer East your

00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:25,940
design material and version control is

00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:29,390
absolutely core to the way software is

00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:30,680
produced so you should understand enough

00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:33,290
about it

00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:36,230
so the reality is that when you teach

00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:39,050
and designers about get they are not

00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:40,870
really learning it they are not really

00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:44,630
really learning version control either

00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:51,530
what they are really learning is about

00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:53,150
suffer as designed material the second

00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,560
reason why I think you should learn

00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:56,990
teach get to designers the designers

00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,720
should learn gate it's because it allows

00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:01,700
them to collaborate more effectively

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,070
with software developers but you're

00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:06,740
aiming for is to turn designers into

00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:09,560
your partners in building this is Paul

00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:11,690
again talking about collaboration it's

00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:16,010
really about being able to participate

00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:17,630
in the development process if you have

00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:20,060
access to the git repository and know

00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:23,480
how to make use of it to get your work

00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:26,120
done then you're able to directly

00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,850
influence the thing that we're working

00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,320
on and

00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,730
we're able to work together as well

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,530
because that's one of the things that

00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,210
get does really well it helps people to

00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:37,670
if they take advantage of it to work

00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:41,610
together to collaborate I suppose but

00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:43,410
yeah so if you're not doing that then

00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:45,510
you're kind of one layer remove you're

00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:47,970
kind of relying on someone else to put

00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:52,350
your changes in and this you know it's

00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:54,030
just just this huge barrier between you

00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:57,330
and getting your changes actually

00:24:54,030 --> 00:25:01,800
integrated what Paul called the barrier

00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:03,840
I called the wall you see I've come

00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,500
across lots of places that are

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,630
structured in this way there is a wall

00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:12,480
one side of the wall are the designers

00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:15,030
on the other side of the wall are the

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,280
developers designers on their side of

00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:19,350
the wall design their stuff and when

00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,700
they think you're done they throw their

00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:23,430
stuff to the other side of the wall and

00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,440
developers pick it up and they try to

00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:27,450
build it the best they can but it never

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,130
occurs to them to reach to the other

00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:32,250
side of the wall when they have a

00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:34,380
question about something some people

00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:37,320
think that working in agile ways or an

00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:39,870
open source type of ways is enough to

00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,660
get rid of the wall well I have notes

00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:45,090
for you that's not true this is because

00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:49,560
the wall is not made of bricks the wall

00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:51,300
is made of attitudes in my experience

00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:54,030
teaching it to designers is one of the

00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:56,940
best ways there are to undermine the

00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:59,130
wall it's not that you are tackling the

00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,900
wall directly you're not trying to

00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:03,090
destroy the wall it's more like you're

00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:06,060
trying to dig a tunnel under the wall

00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:09,270
it's kind of this sneaky way of getting

00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:11,220
rid of the wall culture and once your

00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:13,680
designers understanding it they were

00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:16,710
much more able to become what they

00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:21,150
should be which is your close partners

00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:24,270
in building your suffer there is a third

00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:27,690
reason why I think designers should

00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:30,570
learn about it and it is not knowing it

00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:32,190
gives them the ability to participate in

00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:35,670
the development process

00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:37,890
in their own terms and to exercise a

00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:40,020
meaningful influence in that development

00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:42,090
process and again this is Paul

00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,790
yeah and if you're working if you're a

00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:46,650
man if you're a designer working on a

00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:48,950
project where you are developed as

00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:52,350
you're working away they useing get then

00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:55,830
as we were talking about earlier if you

00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:57,480
don't if you want to make changes to the

00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:02,730
software or you know aspects of the

00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:04,679
software if you if you're not able to

00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:06,150
use get and then you're not going to be

00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:07,770
directly participating you're going to

00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:09,840
have to go to someone else and that

00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:13,160
inevitably means that you're going to be

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,910
some somehow removed from that process

00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,679
you're not going to have as much

00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:18,770
influence over the final product and

00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:23,990
that I think would be quite frustrating

00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:26,850
at least it would be for me so influence

00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:29,780
that's what designers are aiming for and

00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:32,370
that's what kit allows them to have

00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:35,670
inference and this is how it happened

00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:39,030
for me in the year 2 project when I

00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:43,740
learned kit all of a sudden I do realize

00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:46,830
that I had new powers I was not able to

00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:48,780
pick up any patches that were sent on to

00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:51,450
the mailing list untouched the web

00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:54,660
interface and checked them out before

00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:56,460
they were merged into the main tree that

00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:59,100
was that changed everything

00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:01,260
okay for me that changed absolutely

00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,600
everything because these patches were

00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:05,370
coming from all over the world they were

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,890
coming from developers who have never

00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:10,350
met me before who had never worked with

00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:13,410
me directly but they were affecting the

00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:15,179
quality of our design and so if they

00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:16,980
went in without me checking and

00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:19,500
verifying that they were as they should

00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,540
be they could undermine the quality of

00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:25,610
our web interface of all that hard

00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:28,500
design work that we had had to do before

00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:30,540
being able to grab those patches and

00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,190
check them E and check them out before

00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:35,340
they went into them into the main tree

00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:38,910
meant that I could have forced somehow

00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:40,650
this idea of design reviews so in the

00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:42,720
same way that you send your code to the

00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:44,820
mainland list and you accept that your

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,230
peers other software developers will

00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,960
review the code and give you feedback

00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:51,690
when your patches touch the interface

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,280
affect the design you have to come use

00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,170
to the idea that I will

00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:57,390
man give you feedback about your

00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:58,890
implementation of the design and you

00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:00,720
will have to accept that feedback go

00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:03,240
back implemented and then come back

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,850
again with your patches that was

00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,910
difficult it took about six months of me

00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:10,950
making sure that I reviewed every single

00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:13,050
patch that went into the mailing list

00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:15,330
untouched the web interface people

00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:16,560
moaned and complained who is this lady

00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:20,240
the common tell us and send those

00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:23,430
patches back in the end they came round

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,380
right and they you started to work with

00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:27,810
me much closer together so they would

00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:29,940
send me their patches before they submit

00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:31,650
it so we couldn't work iteratively on

00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,150
that implementation to make sure that it

00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:35,520
was a spot-on by the time they said the

00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:37,200
patches the mailing list and once they

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,830
got used to these I actually put it in

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:44,310
right in I kind of formalized this

00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:46,410
design process to make sure that any

00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:49,650
other designers that came after me could

00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:51,690
adopt it and had the backing to be

00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:55,430
listened to if they wanted to review and

00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:57,990
get feedback on those patches influence

00:29:55,430 --> 00:30:00,930
meaningful influence teaching get your

00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:03,240
designers will help them exercise the

00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:04,770
influence and to put that they need to

00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,780
exercise in order to warranty the

00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:08,580
quality of the interface and the design

00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,560
of your software and it will also a

00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:12,570
warranty that they can participate in

00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:15,440
the software development process in

00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:20,820
their own terms and that's very powerful

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:22,470
all right finally there is a final there

00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,950
is another reason well last reason why I

00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:28,590
think designers to learn get you see six

00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:30,330
years ago there very few interaction

00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,830
designers involved in free and open

00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:34,740
source software got together for the

00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:36,030
very first time I've lost them in out of

00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,520
the kind of meeting we kind of

00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:42,570
formulated this idea of open source

00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:44,490
design and we keep wondering why are so

00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:45,810
very few designers who are willing to

00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:48,390
contribute to free and open source

00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:52,170
software well the reality is that those

00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:55,440
designers further faced a phenomenal

00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:58,050
barrier to entry and one of the main

00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:01,920
barriers to entry is the fact that they

00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:04,320
do not understand many of the tools the

00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,760
free and open source projects use to

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,910
organize the

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,590
and that can be really frustrating but

00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:13,650
also it can make them feel quite

00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:17,790
threatened a bit rejected and in general

00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:20,250
a bit be stuff okay by teaching it to

00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:22,440
designers you're actually helping they

00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:25,500
to helping them to overcome that barrier

00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,600
so you are empowering those designers to

00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,790
easily start contributing to free and

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:35,429
open source software if that's what they

00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:36,809
want to do so that's why I think you

00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:40,500
should teach get to designers and why

00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:42,450
the signers should learn kit I'm coming

00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,860
to the end of my story there is just one

00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:46,920
piece of information that I haven't

00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,400
given you yet how long is it going to

00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,550
take

00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:54,090
how long is actually going to take for

00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:57,000
your designers to learn it well I don't

00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:59,070
know I can only tell you how long it

00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,890
took for me and this is a bit

00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:08,670
embarrassing because you see it took me

00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:11,670
two years two years it took me to grasp

00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:14,880
the fundamentals of get but you know

00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:17,520
what it was worth every single meaning

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,679
of it minute of it so yes it's gonna

00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,390
take a long long time yes is gonna be

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,000
quite a bit of effort yeah it's gonna

00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:26,220
require a lot of patience from you

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,530
but once you've taught it to a designer

00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,870
in the other side of the process you're

00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:32,670
gonna have the signers and who are

00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:35,100
better equipped to make design decisions

00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:37,440
about your software you're gonna have

00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:39,690
designers who are better capable to

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,630
collaborate with you you're gonna have

00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:46,350
designers that are empowered to to

00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:47,760
influence and to make yeah meaningful

00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:49,770
influence and participate in meaningful

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,360
ways in the development process and

00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:53,580
you're gonna have designers that are

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,470
empowered to contribute to free and open

00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:57,929
source software if they want to deserve

00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:59,970
but most importantly you will have

00:32:57,929 --> 00:33:04,110
designers who will be forever grateful

00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:05,940
to you for teaching them get thank you

00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:13,609
very much everybody

00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:13,609
[Applause]

00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:33,440
general wonderment I don't know exactly

00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:36,530
how long you are use get a couple of

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,900
years now and still there are things I

00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:43,840
haven't touched and if I have to touch

00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:43,840
them I have colleagues around I can ask

00:33:45,340 --> 00:34:03,650
oh my goodness don't sew everything you

00:33:51,530 --> 00:34:07,040
told rang a bell same physical folder

00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:13,600
where I store some some printouts with

00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:16,129
hand notes and so it's the most powerful

00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:23,060
version control system I've encountered

00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:25,250
I think it's number five and still and

00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:28,310
and relieved I appreciate what the

00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:32,030
leanest robots did they're incredible

00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:35,050
but some points I think it could be

00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:40,730
improved so there

00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:46,070
some some options not named nicely and

00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:49,970
how paths specified especially if you're

00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:52,070
on Windows that's that's a pain in the

00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:57,230
ass but nothing had nothing to do with

00:34:52,070 --> 00:35:02,150
it would get itself what was a big

00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:08,390
barrier for me was the differences

00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:13,160
between remote and and local and what

00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:16,160
the branches are and yes I used a lot of

00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:20,800
graphical tools before because I thought

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:23,770
should make things easier it doesn't and

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:29,020
I'm back to the command line I don't use

00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:29,020
visual tools anymore except for merging

00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:39,480
the thing mental model and system model

00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:42,750
I think that's unfortunately as reality

00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:48,090
it shouldn't be that way so the system

00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:53,850
was system so I think coders should take

00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:56,880
more time to consider that and make this

00:35:53,850 --> 00:36:02,760
gap disappear so the the mental model

00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:06,150
should be very closed yeah I'm a visual

00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:11,820
oriented person I say I have some

00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:13,860
diagrams various repositories can

00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:20,640
interact and they help me a lot in

00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:22,080
understanding what I think everything

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,170
you say is put on and I agree with

00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:27,180
absolutely all of it and I think you're

00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:28,740
right that get could be improved

00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:31,800
no could just be improved it could be

00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:34,740
improved a lot by as you say trying to

00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:37,170
bring together the system and the mental

00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:39,810
models a little bit I what I would love

00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:42,120
to see is the people who maintain get

00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:46,470
actually willing to engage in a user

00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:48,120
research exercise but you know being you

00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:53,880
know I I don't know them personally but

00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:56,130
I am I'm not sure but here it is home

00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,600
video maybe they'll come round and they

00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:00,380
knock another would say hey they see

00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,890
some user research with it users like oh

00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:04,020
yeah

00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:05,760
and it's great to hear that even it's

00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:07,470
very encouraging for me to hear a person

00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,690
who has gone through five different

00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:11,160
version control systems and very

00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:12,780
honestly telling me that it was

00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,270
difficult for them as well because it

00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:24,300
means that you know maybe I'm not that

00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:26,920
sick any other comments yeah I just want

00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,490
to slightly parallel what's being said

00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:34,020
[Music]

00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:35,540
before and I must admit I've fought yet

00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:38,220
for as long as I can

00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:41,250
bitbucket has finally killed mercurial

00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:43,020
for me to me mercurial the commands that

00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,550
you know are more intuitive

00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:47,160
I've come from subversion to mercurial

00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:51,300
it made a lot more sense I do not

00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:53,790
understand yet and it's just listening

00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,800
to you I must say challenge accepted

00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:59,160
I think there's scope for a nice get

00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,540
command which actually just wraps get

00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,430
into commands that you know you're a

00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:05,520
command-line parameters that that aren't

00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:07,110
you ative or more intuitive and perhaps

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,670
I couldn't contact you afterwards and

00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:11,160
maybe we can negotiate something about a

00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:13,170
user interface yeah who cares about the

00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,910
details you just got a primary work for

00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:17,760
that you're trying to implement yeah

00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:19,590
focus on that yeah yes it's powerful yes

00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,290
can do all sorts of things would I ever

00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:24,180
one - probably not yeah I think the

00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:25,830
point - a very interesting thing there

00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,210
are so many people who use git and all

00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:28,620
of them use them in a slightly different

00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,850
way so I've come across a lot of

00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,440
projects and all of them have slightly

00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:33,600
different procedures may be there may be

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:37,230
there could be a way of actually taking

00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:39,870
a subset of get internet in T you know

00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:41,730
standalone version control system that

00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:43,830
works for a specific group of people or

00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:46,470
a specific project I I think that's us

00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:48,720
but I'm happy to talk about graphical

00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:54,090
user interfaces or command line ones as

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:58,320
well so I think it's very important to

00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:59,820
to see that yeah it is I mean you said

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,770
yeah versa or it's a version control

00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,720
system right that's what it's called and

00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:05,850
it's not really good as a pure

00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,860
collaboration system I would say right

00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:09,240
it's it's good for collaboration when it

00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:11,820
needs the version control when it needs

00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:14,160
the ability to roll back and like have

00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,900
tags and whatever but if you want to do

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,850
collaboration then you're basically

00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:21,540
better off with some sort of shared

00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:23,940
folder and so um I think you might be

00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:26,130
aware of the software called Sparkle

00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,540
share which we're we're ignoring

00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:30,600
designers actually did this they

00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:33,360
abstracted everything way they still use

00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:35,340
git and everyone can install it and you

00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,590
just have to put in the server but then

00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:39,690
the commits just looked like add finally

00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:41,550
remove file name modify file name right

00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:44,850
is the log or the commit log is

00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:47,520
essentially useless I mean to a certain

00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:51,210
extent but it makes it very very easy

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,340
for collaboration and yeah also some

00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:54,840
something unknown also the I think you

00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,250
lightly touched on the wording in the

00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,769
beginning

00:39:56,250 --> 00:40:03,089
last year was a university with design

00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:06,990
students and I kind of tried to have

00:40:03,089 --> 00:40:08,970
them use get or let's say github because

00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:10,529
the easiest what actually was easiest is

00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:13,289
for them to just use the web interface

00:40:10,529 --> 00:40:16,319
to just upload their files I tried a bit

00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:18,299
with with a github for desktop client

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:21,869
which i think is actually very different

00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:24,089
to existing desktop apps apps and that's

00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:25,950
quite useful but one of the biggest

00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:28,410
problem is simply the words like the

00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:30,240
word pull and push just call it download

00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:32,220
and upload essentially you know and and

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,710
commit like why do you have to save

00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:38,130
again to then be able to upload and so

00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:41,069
on and so on so these tiny hurdles

00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:42,420
essentially a hundred percent about the

00:40:41,069 --> 00:40:43,980
words that's why I think it's very

00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,900
important to be able to explain things

00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:48,180
beyond those words you need to link

00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:49,980
those words those commands to concepts

00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,930
on things people can actually understand

00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:54,329
so then the pool on the push or they

00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:57,059
pull a bit and they fetch whatever they

00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:59,490
just become kind of the wrapper to those

00:40:57,059 --> 00:41:01,829
concepts that people understand about

00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:04,289
their students stuff and github I

00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:05,819
totally understand I think when you are

00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:06,839
engaging with the students for a very

00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:08,640
short period of time

00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:10,079
you kind of have to work around that and

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,880
the most efficient way is just teach

00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,039
them but I think it's not sustainable

00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,690
either because of that issue I explained

00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:17,759
before that if you don't understand the

00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:20,460
basic concepts github puts them in your

00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:22,410
face so it's just in the long term and

00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:24,509
if you have the time and the luxury of

00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:25,829
time you should try and make sure the

00:41:24,509 --> 00:41:28,259
people understand the concepts but I

00:41:25,829 --> 00:41:30,690
totally understand it is hard and there

00:41:28,259 --> 00:41:32,400
are loads of little hurdles and about

00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:33,809
what collaboration means in sparkles

00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,369
here this Parker sure people did a

00:41:33,809 --> 00:41:36,809
wonderful thing you know it's it's a

00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:39,329
great little piece of software but I

00:41:36,809 --> 00:41:41,490
think what collaboration actually is how

00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:43,799
it's made easier or harder it's highly

00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:45,720
contextual so for some people like

00:41:43,799 --> 00:41:47,880
designers like us using sparkle share

00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:50,519
and might be easier for collaboration

00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,980
for people like Poole he actually

00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:54,509
prefers kit so I think with this higher

00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,279
level concepts collaboration

00:41:54,509 --> 00:41:57,809
collaboration means different things for

00:41:56,279 --> 00:42:00,359
different people and it's easier or

00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:05,700
harder in different ways but yeah I

00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:07,829
agree is part experience I was going to

00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:09,490
add a comment from a software developers

00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:12,040
perspective

00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:14,140
so I am a software developer I started

00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:18,130
with my first version control system was

00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:20,050
s CCS a long time ago and I think what

00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:23,380
you're saying about git I would see it

00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:24,609
so to reassure you and I don't think I

00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:30,390
understand it completely

00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:34,119
even though nobody does I'm using it and

00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:36,490
to your point that I would I would see

00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:39,310
it as a if you want to run a complicated

00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:41,050
human language know if you have French

00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:42,849
speaking and I had to learn German it

00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:45,069
was difficult for me you can reduce that

00:42:42,849 --> 00:42:46,930
to a subset and you still go by you know

00:42:45,069 --> 00:42:48,670
you could by speaking minimum German you

00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:50,589
can still order a beer and pizza and

00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:52,540
something else and survive and I would

00:42:50,589 --> 00:42:54,190
do the same and get and really restrict

00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,780
yourself to a small subset of the

00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:57,490
commands like you were saying if you

00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:59,470
know if you know how to do clone and

00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:01,960
commit and push you're already in

00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:03,490
business and maybe basic usage of the

00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,770
branches and that's good enough

00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:07,510
and one thing we get is that if you

00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:11,260
don't understand the command do not use

00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:12,819
it with get you contrary as you were

00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:14,920
mentioning subversion with subversion

00:43:12,819 --> 00:43:17,740
you cannot destroy anything with get you

00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:19,480
count so you should really be careful if

00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:26,680
you don't understand something you like

00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:28,510
in I've heard these many times listen to

00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,589
this monk this is very good advice if

00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:35,170
you don't know what the command bass

00:43:29,589 --> 00:43:37,349
don't use it any other questions or

00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:39,609
comments

00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:41,160
lovely so we're at all thank you very

00:43:39,609 --> 00:43:46,830
much

00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:46,830
