Nowadays almost all of the Apache bigdata projects can be started in Kubernetes in some way. But the biggest question is still open: what is the most effective way to manage a set of coherent projects together? What is the best way to start and operate Hadoop, Ozone, HBase, Kafka, Spark, etc. together in Kubernetes?

Traditional cluster management tools -- like Ambari -- are based on an host-based, agent centric approach which doesn’t apply very well to the cloud-native environments.

In this presentation we will analyze the key challenges of running multiple Apache project together in Kubernetes (eg. configuration dependency, topology profiles, composability). And we will show how Kubernetes tools like Helm or Kustomize can answer those questions.

A real-life demo will presented about how to leverage tools of the kubernetes ecosystem to provide user experiences similar to the existing cluster management tools and how to provide an unified user experience to manage different projects of the Apache bigdata ecosystem.
