good evening everyone

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,490
and today I'll be talking about UI

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,650
development in Big Data world using open

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,800
source I'll be telling my experience in

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,539
Big Data world from last 11 years in Big

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,220
Data space how we have evolved in

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,170
different frameworks what we have used

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,210
how we created different frameworks what

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:28,760
we are using from open source and how we

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:31,230
are solving those problems and that's it

00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,759
so little bit about myself so I'm

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,530
Paramjeet jolly working as a director of

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,140
engineering at guavas at Allis company

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,710
and we are required to year ago by

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,140
thalis group I'm having 19a of

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,999
experience in UI design and development

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,879
in different domains multimedia

00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:50,460
elearning pharma Fitness Big Data

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,519
telecom network security IOT so all

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,019
these domains we have worked upon and

00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:59,449
from last 11 years I'm working with

00:00:55,019 --> 00:01:03,629
growers mainly on big data analytics and

00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:07,979
I'm a local leader for UX India in Delhi

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:10,469
NCR I'm acting speaker for UX and UI

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,530
conferences in India and this is the

00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:17,219
first time in Apache Conference it's

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:19,259
about tallis talis is we are 80,000

00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:22,740
implants across the globe we we have a

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:25,289
presence of 68 countries and it has 1

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,950
billion self-funded R&D center and we

00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:30,659
have 19 billion sales in 2018 and if you

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,039
talk about from the bottom of the ocean

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,560
to the depth of space and cyberspace

00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:36,810
everywhere we are we are into digital

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,090
identity insecurity we are into defence

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,439
insecurity we are into aerospace we're

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,840
into space we are into ground

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,850
transportation system so tell us is into

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,409
all different domains and we've been

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,270
acquired two year ago berth Allah said

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,649
just to look at from analytics

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,869
perspective how we can bring in the

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:56,759
analytic ability and able to solve those

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:58,530
problems in these different domains so

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,749
let's go the agenda for today what we'll

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,490
be covering is first is why you as

00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:04,140
important big data world what is the

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,299
significance of you in big data world

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,340
you are already seen lot of people were

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,950
talking about how we will use big data

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,480
how you will process the data so now

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,640
that now the thing is how you want to

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,970
visualize the data how do you actually

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,690
get value out of it next is how to

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,910
target

00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,290
problems telling or our experience for

00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,020
kind of different big data problems you

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,780
have in UI user interfaces and how do we

00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,640
solve them

00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,110
next is framework and tool selection

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,700
criteria so this is one of the key

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,430
aspect every company who is moving into

00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,230
Big Data find this problem like which

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,360
tool I should select what should be my

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,370
selection criteria what are the points I

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,140
should be looking at a tool to find it

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,480
I try to jot it down my experience on

00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,720
that I created a sheet also which you

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,840
can have it from my Twitter as give the

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,610
Twitter handle later on and then I'll

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,490
talk about evolution or Big Data you add

00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:59,130
goers how we have evolved in terms of UI

00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:03,540
development in GU hours from last 11

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:05,790
years then we will talk about whether to

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,740
use a custom framework or you have to

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,720
use open source do you need to write it

00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,490
yourself or you can use it over so there

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,560
are multiple options available now you

00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:17,160
need to see in what condition what have

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,840
to be used and then I'll give you a demo

00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,820
of custom framework and open source tool

00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,720
and the applications here build I will

00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:26,160
give small two demos on that then why to

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,050
contribute to open source why it is

00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,520
important to contribute to open source

00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,500
because we also started recently

00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,209
contributing earlier we were like we

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,980
working in closed loop developing our

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:37,290
framework internally now we are thinking

00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,300
we should go beyond it and try to expand

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:42,780
our skills and try to make sure people

00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:45,180
use what we build also and then design

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,920
us for future how we should be thinking

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,810
about what should be the design for the

00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:53,180
future we should be doing one of things

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:55,650
we need to take care ok so first part is

00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,750
why you as important big data world as

00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,060
you see human brain can process images

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,160
much faster than spreadsheet and data

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:06,090
tables so it's easy for human brains to

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:08,280
process image is much much faster so if

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,140
you talk about why us big important big

00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,730
data world so left hand side you see

00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,670
there is a huge amount of data being

00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,500
generated by all the IOT devices we guys

00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,390
are producing all this data and there's

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,919
a intermediate between there is a brain

00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,260
which is analytic and machine learning

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,320
which is consuming this whole data and

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,880
try to patronize that thing and finally

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,919
it goes to a dashboard which is a user

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,050
interface which actually tells you the

00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:32,550
right insight about the data so that

00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,680
customers can take up

00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,680
decision depending on these insights and

00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,240
so UI is the real bridge between

00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:43,560
analytics and the end user so that

00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,540
really helps so then another way to look

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,310
at it Big Data is a kind of mess all

00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,440
around it analytics help you to

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,610
patronize the data and you why is the

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,280
one which help you take the right

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,050
decision where what to do what is

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,150
happening your network and then you can

00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,040
take your key decision so UI is the real

00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:03,120
thing which actually is a face to the

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,610
customer so now let's talk about how to

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,010
target big data problems how we should

00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,230
be targeting big data problems so this

00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,610
is the kind of experience we have how we

00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,200
have dealt with different kind of

00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,790
problems in Big Data what are the

00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:19,290
different things coming across and then

00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:20,670
how do you target them first is whenever

00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,440
you are going for any big data

00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:24,450
application you know the first thing

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,460
what is the use case I am trying to

00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,170
solve it get the full picture clarity

00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,910
what is the product is all about you

00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,220
need to understand holistic view of it

00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,660
then define the personas for which your

00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,340
application is built for who are the

00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,830
user whether it is built for network

00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,120
engineer is it built for CEOs for the

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,160
salespeople you have to define the

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,630
personas and then UX and the user

00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,820
journeys how they're going to through

00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:46,770
the whole application so first define

00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,960
all these things and then also finalized

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,790
which form factor you to use it because

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,220
most of the C excellency use they are

00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,660
using tablets and mobile these days for

00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,400
their day-to-day work so you have to

00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,440
first finalize those things so once you

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,540
have this picture clarity or for your

00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,340
burglar application now you know this is

00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,590
my whole application now I had to

00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,930
identify which are the areas which

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,640
really deals with big data because in

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,560
big data application never happens like

00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,360
everything is big data there are certain

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,740
areas which deals with really big data

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,420
so you have to make sure you identify

00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,220
those particular areas in your

00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,050
application which are going to deal with

00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,720
big data and the next step would be

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,950
depend on the big data visual needs you

00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,660
know to choose different libraries

00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,250
depending on your virtual needs you

00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,410
might have to choose like lot of people

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,660
are using d3 DS these days d3 is

00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:32,970
widespread across everywhere it is being

00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,220
used and if you are going for analytics

00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:37,440
and those use cases plotly just a great

00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,510
library for that each arts if you have

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,910
happened to see there a lot of the small

00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,680
stickers of every story for each arts

00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,240
this is also very good library so you

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,260
can depending on your need you can

00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,300
choose these libraries

00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,580
like Sigma J Cyrus Capital Inc leaders

00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,280
these are for the network graphs and big

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,360
data these are useful key lines this is

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,220
a paid library this is a very good

00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,530
library we have used in one of our

00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:01,200
network security product it offers a lot

00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:03,240
of good features and none of the library

00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,130
has that kind of feature paid library

00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,810
but now we are trying to build something

00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,510
similar on top of Six Sigma J's and

00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,310
there's three J's if you are working on

00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:13,230
3d kind of utilization features a very

00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:15,030
good library so there is a huge set of

00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:17,400
library which are available in market

00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,990
and mostly are open source you can look

00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,210
at them and try to see which fits your

00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,410
use case and the next part is once you

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,230
choose in the library you have to make

00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:26,730
sure it is performing properly you have

00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,710
to meet the SLA for the customer when

00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,870
you're visualizing any big data you have

00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:33,180
to make sure it is being rendered on

00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,800
proper time which is unneeded by your

00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,640
customer maybe few seconds because he

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,050
cannot wait for minutes and all next is

00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:44,700
caching support needing the big data

00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:47,430
areas so what happens is usually big

00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:49,740
data applications it takes time to load

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:51,600
different views from the user so what

00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,400
you need to do is all your views which

00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,440
are being frequently used by customers

00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,320
you have to be cache you can use the

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,970
caching mechanism back in 2011/12 we

00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,860
were using our own caching mechanism

00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,570
Rubik internal caching mechanism

00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,180
nowadays there are a lot of open source

00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:08,310
things are available at this mobile DB

00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,450
you can use them for caching so caching

00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,610
is really important in Big Data

00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:13,620
application so that user has a great

00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,810
experience while accessing it because if

00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,490
you have everything and you don't show

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,800
in time then it will be really difficult

00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,750
for user to accept that application so

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,500
your acceptance will automatically if it

00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:27,930
has a good SSL is next days long running

00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,310
queries convert them to reports so what

00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,110
we have analyzed over a period

00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,750
whenever in bigger application

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,950
everything cannot be used in UI itself

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,840
you have to make sure there are certain

00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:39,420
areas which can be converted into

00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,550
reports so like that you can use Crystal

00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:43,860
Reports we have used we ourself I used

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:46,680
Bert reporting tool in our framework so

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,230
unit identify which are the things which

00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,580
you know didn't really convert into that

00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:52,650
so it will reduce the load on your end

00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,630
user and you will notify once the

00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:57,390
reporting is ready you can email them

00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:59,730
so for and so forth and then offline

00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:01,500
data factory is during the development

00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,019
it is mainly meant for the developer who

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,760
are actually from UI development

00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:08,220
background they know like because

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,810
back-end is never ready when you start

00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,540
developing UI you have to wait for it

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,160
and for that period unit to have some

00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,899
kind of contract ready and you can use

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,149
some kind of offline factory how many of

00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:23,399
you here are from your development front

00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:24,720
end anybody from front end here ok so

00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,930
most of the guys are back end so I see

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,850
like most of the sessions are around

00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:33,750
back and now it's like turn to see the

00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:35,850
different colors of the UI next is

00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,649
identifying need for real-time versus

00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,600
Auto refresh because every application

00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:41,430
may not need near to the real-time

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,050
sometime they were because some of the

00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:46,440
application the data is being aggregated

00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:47,880
maybe for an hour maybe six hours a day

00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,440
depending on application you know to

00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,760
find out whether or turn fresh is good

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,880
for me weather should I go for the

00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,430
real-time application and then gravity

00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,110
based min max so this is a kind of

00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,120
internal term we are using on how people

00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:03,029
are interpreting it so I have tried to

00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,760
pictorially show it how what'd that mean

00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:08,310
actually in a lot of application what

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,920
happens is data is relevant only when it

00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,540
is nearly fresh after that you can

00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,459
aggregate and keep it so like I'm

00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,560
showing here last two months we are

00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:18,389
keeping all the early points and then

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,339
for last 55 months we are keeping daily

00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:21,990
points and beyond that is just a monthly

00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:24,000
point because data may not be that

00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:26,040
important for that particular moment but

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,290
in certain application where if you're

00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,630
using for security and all that then you

00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,160
may wanted to see what what happened

00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,380
exactly last year at this point of time

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,000
so in those case it may not be useful

00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:38,100
but in a lot of cases it will be useful

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,139
then it will impact your time range

00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,819
selection criteria what components you

00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:46,529
are using that will actually going to

00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:48,120
impact it then is these stay in time

00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:51,810
zone because most of the big data

00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:54,660
applications we are using we are storing

00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,190
data in UTC format and the thing is your

00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,199
customers are in different time so you

00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,760
have to make sure you're handling DST n

00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,470
times or we were initially when building

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,110
our application we are having these

00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:08,670
problem and later on we incorporated DST

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:10,740
a and the timezone and what the library

00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:14,970
we are using is

00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:16,500
this forward the name moment Jesus

00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:20,130
moment Jesus the lividity of using for

00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,660
the time zone handling I ate in support

00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,980
if you are going internationally for

00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,200
your application you have to make sure

00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:28,170
you have iodine and support in your

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,180
system and then theme support because

00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,440
you are in a UI development world you

00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,600
have to make sure your application

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,550
should support theming because all

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,200
different user have a different kind of

00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,790
taste if you look at your phones you're

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,500
using everywhere people give some kind

00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,880
of customisation to you so theming

00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,290
you're also a crucial part whenever go

00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,120
to customer they always want to have

00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:48,720
some kind of theming concept available

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,700
to them and then this is the last one of

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,590
the least is customer problem is

00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,120
changing hence keep your design open for

00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:56,160
extension so this is one of the key

00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,720
learning I had in my last 11 years and

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,850
growers during big data analytics

00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,590
whenever you give something to customer

00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,450
he'll play with it and he'll come back

00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:05,130
with ok I need something different so

00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,900
you have to make sure you are your

00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,790
design is open for extension because in

00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:13,560
big data world problems keep changing

00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:15,420
its not remain same now next is how to

00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,280
choose a right framework any tool what

00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,780
should be our criteria what we have

00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,830
evolve over a period and tried to come

00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:23,670
out with their list we'll go through it

00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,140
first is they ordering in support

00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,940
whenever is choosing a tool you have to

00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,040
make sure it has a right set of layouts

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,560
being there otherwise you'll get stuck I

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,180
can only put my widgets here and there

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,290
and these are the only layouts I have to

00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,580
make sure one of the different

00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,380
application you're building you have

00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,900
some kind of fluid layout you have a

00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,730
custom custom layout in support so find

00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,920
out your framework should have two

00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:46,650
supporting these things and then is

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,600
basic charting support any applications

00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:51,060
in analytics will need some basic

00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,210
charting at least so it you need to have

00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:57,360
all the bar chart line chart pie chart

00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:58,710
extra and then this is goes when it is

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,690
slightly advanced you need to go for

00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:02,610
graph visualization because in big data

00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,590
world you try to see how your networks

00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,970
are being connected how their nodes are

00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:08,400
connected what are their link loads

00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,200
what is the each node health so you want

00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,640
to see all and whatever kind of patterns

00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,800
they are being connected because you'll

00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,390
get a lot of insights from this so that

00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,670
helps to have these kind of

00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:19,290
visualizations and then map

00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,150
visualization because nowadays

00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:23,490
everything is lat/long ways if you look

00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:25,020
at your data itself Hoover is Hoover is

00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,779
long based your food when you're

00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,820
arriving it's like all lat/long based so

00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:31,709
most of the data is lat/long based you

00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,170
have to make sure you have a map well

00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:36,149
connected in your framework and gives

00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,770
you the flexibility to allow to give you

00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,180
a lot of layers on top of it where you

00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:44,070
can visualize analyze your data and

00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:47,339
create more customizations timeline

00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:49,290
selector so this is one of the thing

00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:51,600
which we have used like mostly quicklink

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:53,820
most of people used because in UI what

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,790
happens is whenever a user opens you

00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,290
want to see some kind of view depending

00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,630
on the time range like today yesterday

00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:02,640
it could be in minutes like last one

00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:04,020
minute depending on the your use case

00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,910
you might have to support so your

00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,980
framework or tool should have this kind

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:10,440
of widget which allows you to do these

00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,300
kind of things in fact that gravity

00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,430
based time will max is going to come

00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:17,130
here also if you have that kind of data

00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:19,200
storage and obviously custom is there

00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:22,350
which is like everywhere most of the all

00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:26,880
the frameworks time zone and DST support

00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:28,560
we already talked about it filters so

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,800
filter is one of the key aspect while

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,440
analyzing lot of tools open source we

00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,600
found out like they have problems in

00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,459
having the global and local filters to

00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,020
identify what is global filter what is

00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:41,399
local filter we come out with the

00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,200
definition people know it they have

00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,000
their own set of definitions and then we

00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,130
find out in different tools what they

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,779
are what they have now we are working on

00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:50,610
a superset so they have certain

00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:52,260
capabilities which is not available we

00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,810
are trying to build them so global

00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:56,910
filter as you see in this particular

00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,829
application the top bar which is it

00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:00,390
shows on that off right now that is

00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:03,089
clear or not but it is like a global

00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:04,620
which is across the module those filters

00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:06,630
if you apply like I want to see only the

00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:09,660
owner traffic or the on a traffic so

00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:11,250
then it will be useful and local filter

00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,230
is more like on the page level when you

00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:16,350
click on a visit it passes say you click

00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:18,720
on New York here on the on the legend

00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:21,540
here then it filters all the top impact

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,160
itself for the New York and depending on

00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,680
that will show you the trend for the New

00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,480
York so this is a kind of act we call it

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,350
as a local filters so framework should

00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,089
support it next is that were linking so

00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:35,190
dashboard linking is more or like you

00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:37,110
are interlinking between one - go to

00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,730
another dashboard could be a module

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,890
definition so this is one of our

00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,690
customer use case I'm showing here we're

00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,790
linking from he's drilling down to a

00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,579
particular anomalous and normally here

00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:49,860
you click on anomaly it goes to the next

00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:51,120
module where it shows the inner B is

00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,950
open or you're showing with this is

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,339
particular cell which is anomalous in

00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:58,290
behavior so this is really useful and

00:15:55,339 --> 00:16:00,450
then this is one of the crucial part V

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,589
and realized over a period like this has

00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,660
to be there when you are actually

00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:05,820
working on Big Data application

00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,620
connecting multiple data sources because

00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,810
big data application cannot be just

00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,269
served by one or two data sources

00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:14,310
depending on the use case you might have

00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:17,940
to use elastic search you might have to

00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:20,220
use MongoDB HDFS high HBase so there are

00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,660
n number of stories are you know to

00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,250
connect to them so you have to choose a

00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,170
tool which can connect to all these

00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,730
because initially I'll be talking later

00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:29,010
on the slides like we choose in Cabana

00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:31,290
and then we had some problems because it

00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:33,300
was natively connecting only to elastic

00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,279
so so that's how we learn like this is

00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:39,420
one of the crucial part while selecting

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:41,760
your tool next is cancel query support

00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:44,180
this is also a good learning we had like

00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:47,490
in Big Data application what happens is

00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:49,649
some initially you convert all the big

00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,839
queries into reports but still there are

00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:53,519
app queries which takes longer time due

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,440
to so for whatever problem in the

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,510
backend or maybe there is something loop

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,040
is going on then in that case you I

00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,600
should be able to have a cancel query

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,640
support he can cancel it and move it

00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,559
further so that his experience is not

00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,480
dead so this is also important which

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,689
unit to see whether that framework

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,579
supports or not the next is query

00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:14,160
builder support because what happens is

00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:16,079
in Big Data world everything cannot be

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,150
shown using UI because you cannot

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,309
provide hundred screens so the user it

00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,929
may not be relevant to them so what

00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:24,059
happens is you don't have some kind of

00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:26,130
basic depending on the persona there are

00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:28,230
two kind of thing we are having here one

00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:30,570
is like basic query builder and as

00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:33,690
advanced so basic is more like the guys

00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,890
who can do drag-and-drop based basic

00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,240
queries all that stuff they can do

00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,610
because they don't know SQL

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,679
very much in that case you know to give

00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:42,360
some kind of query builder here and then

00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,470
in case of advanced user you to just

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,210
give them a text box where they can

00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,650
quickly write their own queries because

00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,690
DBS and all those guys

00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:50,220
administrators are usually well-versed

00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,940
with SQL queries they wanted to write

00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,510
themselves rather

00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:57,090
and dragging dropping the queries so

00:17:54,510 --> 00:18:00,030
this is really helpful then next is

00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:02,610
export export is also one of the

00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:04,200
important expect of beginner application

00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:06,090
because whenever you are dealing with

00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,680
data some time it happens you wanted to

00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,720
export and send it to somebody over the

00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,640
email you want to send some reports to

00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,310
them and most of the application what

00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,230
happens is one of the output from this

00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,670
application could be used as input in

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,530
their application so that could be

00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,760
different kind of formats which customer

00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,770
might need or they could be standard

00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,750
formats which is required so that's why

00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:26,010
I put like a snapshot for sending your

00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,420
if there is an anomalous behavior

00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,010
happening once an after and send it to

00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,960
your networking jadam and in the use

00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:35,040
case you might have to think how do you

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,690
export them next is dashboard sharing so

00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,670
this move sharing is like whatever you

00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:40,800
see on a visually you want to quickly

00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,960
share their dashboard you want to email

00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,520
them somebody and what happened nowadays

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,620
you want to embed that particular widget

00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,090
inside your own applications lot of

00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,190
people give that capability like in

00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:52,890
YouTube URL you can put it and then you

00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:57,180
can give it to the people next is

00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:58,620
real-time data support so lot of big

00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,600
data application are nearly real

00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,660
real-time so you want to make sure your

00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:06,420
framework supports the real-time

00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:08,190
applications and then security

00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:10,440
it looks security is just a peripheral

00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,450
requirement of any book any application

00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,310
but this is the crucial part because a

00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:16,290
lot of customers like we are dealing

00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:18,090
with the reliance geo they are one of

00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:20,220
the largest growing network in the world

00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:22,020
so they have like minimum security

00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,880
requirements security has to be there to

00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,770
go to production so you have to have an

00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,810
proper I am based authentication

00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,250
authorization user management all that

00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:33,780
stuff and or it can connect to the

00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:35,610
different kind of I am service and then

00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,100
your framework should have testing a

00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,630
monitoring support testing in terms of

00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,280
like it should have end-to-end test

00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,170
cases it should have unit test cases and

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,520
it has a monitoring support what is

00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:46,440
happening in the system you would able

00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,060
to analyze visualize at what is

00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,380
happening behind it so that while

00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:52,560
running your application you can see

00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:55,380
that part last but not least here is

00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,270
documentation it looks as a developer

00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,890
initially documentation is okay for all

00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,540
the features supported but frankly

00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:02,490
speaking of documentation is not good

00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,960
and of the day you will feel really

00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,830
pissed off because you will not like

00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,300
that

00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,710
so after if you have to debug and find

00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,810
out everything so documentation it was

00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:11,640
well done and so that you can easily

00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:13,500
understand features because while using

00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,900
any software for the first time is quick

00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,610
and easy but when you go into detail you

00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,380
try to find those problem if it is not

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:23,100
well documented so this is one of the

00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:24,870
good criteria you need to look at so

00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,460
this is kind of a session that TS sheet

00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:28,770
I come up with all these points are

00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:32,190
bulleted here and I have shared this on

00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:34,800
Twitter and another thing is like basic

00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,930
retainer from open sources like license

00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:40,590
type list of company who are using it

00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:42,240
stars forget how many stars it has bug

00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,370
and feature commit rate whether it is

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,270
being fixed really quickly or not or you

00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,680
have to wait for it

00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,120
so these are the minimum thing you know

00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,040
to see and then what is the future

00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,870
roadmap is it aligned to your vision or

00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,090
not that's important some level of

00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:56,490
clarity has to be there before choosing

00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:58,140
that part because in being in a world if

00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:00,510
you're choosing a framework a tool you

00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:02,730
are actually acquiring it for long term

00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:07,350
you cannot do it for months or a year

00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:09,750
just evolution of Big Data ui8 growers

00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:12,840
so here I were talking about how we have

00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:15,120
evolved from 2008 when I joined growers

00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,100
and till date where we are where we are

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:22,050
heading next in terms of technology and

00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:25,830
framework hope it is visible guys see

00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:29,220
that colors are light okay so back in

00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:31,680
2008 we started we were using flex flex

00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,630
at that time was not a patch a it got

00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,760
acquired somewhere it got donated around

00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:38,040
ten ten thousand eleven twelve something

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,660
near to that so initially when we

00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,370
started using a patch of flex so

00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,960
building big data application it was all

00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:45,690
static dashboards you are also learning

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:50,760
big data big data was new to the market

00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:52,260
that mine and then towards 2010 when

00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,520
customers were start using our

00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,140
application they say and we need some

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,610
kind of interactive dashboard and then

00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,230
the reporting starts coming I told you

00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:00,510
like there are a couple of areas where

00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:02,820
it takes hours to generate things then

00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:04,950
we created them into reports and during

00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:07,380
this time we created a UI kit on top of

00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:09,480
flex is like a small thin framework

00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,160
which helped us to starter a starter

00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,980
application quickly all the basic

00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:16,140
functionality security module generation

00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,730
basic things were ready inside the kit

00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,430
with some some level of components

00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:22,410
available so development time we can

00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:25,920
reduce so that was the how we started

00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:28,770
here and then 2012 when we were working

00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:31,170
towards a lot of other customer then the

00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:33,090
era was more like people wanted to

00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:35,550
explore UI they want to have more

00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:37,380
exploration in their hands so we created

00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:39,150
a framework in flex itself we call it a

00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,950
watermelon that's why this icon is there

00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:43,350
so it was all about a configuration

00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:44,970
based framework you have to just define

00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:47,850
your configuration for your query for

00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:51,050
your UI and then it generates a proper

00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:55,620
application for you using our UI engine

00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:57,960
so after 2012 when we move towards 15

00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:01,200
there are transition happening from flex

00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,600
to HTML and the view tried initially

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,660
moving using hybrid application of flex

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,850
and HTML because HTML was not supporting

00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:10,860
everything well properly on browsers as

00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:12,570
well as flex I cannot hybrid reuse

00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,280
properly with them so we had a lot of

00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:16,200
problems at that time and then we

00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:18,330
thought let's do anything let's use

00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,700
angular we started our first application

00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:23,700
using angularjs and we created the

00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,860
similar kit in html5 and now our

00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,180
applicants startup time is also become

00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,680
lesser because having this thin

00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:31,140
framework in place and there are

00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,340
alerting actions all that stuff whenever

00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,410
something happens you want to have an

00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,940
alert this is a closed loop decisioning

00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:37,650
all that stuff start happening people

00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,990
wanted to have a closed loop something

00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:44,220
happens in notify the user and he'll

00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:46,530
close that part and from 15 to 18 when

00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,870
we are developing this UI kit is we have

00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:52,370
moved transition our angularjs kid to a

00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:55,650
real latest angular version and and

00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:57,210
beyond that now we are moving towards

00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,800
the world where data exploration tool

00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:00,690
for the experts is being built right now

00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,090
if you've seen most of the talks today

00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:05,310
are around here in this room exactly

00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:07,590
they were talking about data exploration

00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:10,350
tools for data scientist for product

00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:12,060
managers so we were building these tools

00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:13,440
and then we thought let's explore the

00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:15,150
market what is happening in the market

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,460
what kind of data relation tools are

00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:20,610
there we have looked at cabaÃ±as graph on

00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:22,170
a lot of other tools arcadia and then we

00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:24,390
nailed our super set is a kind of it was

00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:26,370
in Apache Incubator it has lot of good

00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:28,200
features and it was kind of aligned to

00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:31,080
what we were thinking to build and then

00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,780
we took a patch a super set and we call

00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,280
it our patches

00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,930
super set plus plus because we are

00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,420
building some functionality on top of it

00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:39,910
and talking to super set guys because we

00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:42,550
have some really good plants where we

00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:44,380
can make a plug in play model for super

00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:46,060
set which Cabana has but super set

00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,040
doesn't have so we are talking to them

00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:49,780
if we can build that and we were able to

00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,660
contribute to that and be really helpful

00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:55,480
for the whole community so right now in

00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:58,450
2018 what we have is angular based UI

00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,250
kit we have plus we have a reactors

00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:01,120
basically the technologies is being used

00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,680
in super set

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,240
so the combination what is happening all

00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,760
the production application right now are

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,860
being built using our UI kit based on

00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,930
angular and super set is mainly used for

00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:13,870
data exploration right now that real

00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:15,670
goal is to build our application using

00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:18,550
super set we want to enable a developer

00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:23,260
also instead of just our drag and drop

00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:25,090
based personas and 2020 is the future

00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:27,400
that's why it is kind of light color I

00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:29,200
used it so it is so we wanted to make

00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,030
sure data explorations tool is available

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,890
to all the people across the globe

00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,240
because what is happening is now every

00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:37,450
company is talking about data big data

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,980
big data so everybody wanted to use some

00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:41,230
tool which can help them to quickly

00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:43,000
generate insights so we a market is

00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:47,410
heading towards and slowly we are also

00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:50,830
moving in their direction so after

00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:52,450
giving my experience over the last 11

00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:53,860
years on how we have evolved in

00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,230
different frameworks using different

00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:57,850
technologies let's see whether we have

00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:59,740
to write custom framework or we have to

00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:01,210
use open source tool to develop what we

00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,650
should be doing because developer is

00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:04,060
always confused whenever he get and

00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:06,160
things like whether I should be using

00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:08,470
react angular vu whether I should be

00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,880
using Cabana super set graph on XYZ

00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:13,240
there are lot of other frameworks our

00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:15,580
tools are available so when to use a

00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,090
custom framework so whenever when you

00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:20,440
need to actually use a custom framework

00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:22,270
when your vision is not matching with

00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,770
any of the open source if your vision is

00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:25,090
not aligned with any of the open source

00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:26,980
then it makes sense you have to create

00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:29,230
your own because you need some kind of

00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,970
thin frame but too many customization

00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,710
needed every time it means you need to

00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:34,630
do lot of work he also make a thin

00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:36,640
framework so that it will reduce your

00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:38,080
some level of work but customization bar

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,260
has to be there because it is changing

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,600
for you long term vision to create

00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:45,639
differential in the market if you have

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,959
in mind like you want to create some

00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:48,669
back in the market would create some

00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:51,700
different thing then obviously this is

00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:52,869
the way to go could be a potential

00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,249
candidate for the new open source

00:26:52,869 --> 00:26:56,909
because you are already thinking to have

00:26:54,249 --> 00:27:00,219
a differentiator then you wanted to

00:26:56,909 --> 00:27:02,469
create it so benefits would be like

00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:05,950
better control future-proof value in the

00:27:02,469 --> 00:27:08,289
market so when to use open source tool

00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:10,570
that was like when to use the custom one

00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:12,129
now is like when to use the open source

00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,909
tool what should be the driving factor

00:27:12,129 --> 00:27:15,249
behind it

00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:16,809
so most of the needed features available

00:27:15,249 --> 00:27:19,719
you know pursued if you look at it like

00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:21,879
we have chosen super set and because we

00:27:19,719 --> 00:27:23,589
found lot of the feature which we need

00:27:21,879 --> 00:27:26,769
to create ourselves are readily

00:27:23,589 --> 00:27:29,019
available they are why not to use it has

00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:30,309
extension extensible architecture for

00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:32,200
your vision because there is a crucial

00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:34,089
part you have to look at where you want

00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,799
to take this tool to then accordingly

00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:37,299
you will see whether the architectural

00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:39,309
vision is available that's how the

00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:41,049
documentation part is very key while

00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:43,509
doing it because otherwise you will find

00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:44,859
very difficult yourself to debug and

00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:46,209
design the whole system if the

00:27:44,859 --> 00:27:50,200
documentation is good you'll try to

00:27:46,209 --> 00:27:51,999
understand it well connect to multiple

00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,529
data so as I mentioned they are like

00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:55,629
this is one of the crucial part when we

00:27:53,529 --> 00:27:57,309
choose a tool because in big data you

00:27:55,629 --> 00:27:59,499
have to make sure it connects to all the

00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:01,329
different data sources if not to all at

00:27:59,499 --> 00:28:03,219
least to the most stuff and you can

00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:05,169
write your own plugins like for in case

00:28:03,219 --> 00:28:08,139
of superset when we are choosing it we

00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:09,729
have done a small POC on elastic

00:28:08,139 --> 00:28:13,089
connector and we are successfully able

00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:14,320
to connect to the elastic and then we

00:28:13,089 --> 00:28:16,690
thought this is the right way to move

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,489
because it already is about lot of data

00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:20,289
sources and then if it was not

00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:22,059
supporting elastic V wrote a rotary

00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:25,419
connector and similarly we cannot enter

00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:27,459
for other things and then easy to theme

00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:28,809
and customize this is also one of the

00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:31,209
key factors whenever you're choosing

00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:33,070
flavors whenever you are a developer so

00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:35,229
multiple customer you might have to use

00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:38,559
different themes they want to customize

00:28:35,229 --> 00:28:39,879
themselves tool is actively and has done

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,979
fixed in market this is the key factor

00:28:39,879 --> 00:28:43,450
while choosing it because if it is not

00:28:41,979 --> 00:28:45,009
fixed and because you cannot own

00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,450
everything you have to have if you're

00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:48,729
going in open so they have to be

00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:52,269
community behind it which is actually

00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:53,019
doing it benefits are like time to

00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:54,969
market

00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:57,369
lots of hand to develop it in like in

00:28:54,969 --> 00:28:59,380
our case when we started super set day

00:28:57,369 --> 00:29:00,940
one is like

00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:03,670
within a week it was available in our

00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:05,080
customer premises and worse servers if

00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:06,880
we have to develop our own framework

00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:11,530
would have taken at least a month or so

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:13,600
to get it to the production then how to

00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:15,280
choose a custom framework what should be

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,260
a criteria because developer is confused

00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,840
whether I should using ember jQuery

00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:21,850
react vu and there are pleasure of

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:25,480
polymer or should I write on my GS

00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:27,190
framework the developers have lot of

00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,840
common questions on that like if we

00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:30,280
search on Google it will say ok these

00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,960
are the top three femurs available in

00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,880
the market still you have question like

00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,770
which is better for my project

00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,020
which offer me the best performance

00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:40,660
which is good for small size big size

00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:42,400
application which of three is the most

00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:45,220
reliable one which offered me the

00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,540
max-flow maximum flexibility which

00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,370
factors to consider while choosing your

00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,720
frameworks so if you drill down to a

00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,960
customer cell you still have lot of

00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:55,060
questions in your mind so I have

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,410
compared all these three and you'll find

00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,420
a lot of these on internet what are the

00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:00,490
comparisons they have but I will try to

00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:03,270
focus on the major part of it which are

00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:06,220
like a major bulleted one is like in a

00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:08,470
easy-to-learn which is most easy to run

00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:10,390
like in case of angular it is like you

00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:12,760
know to learn typescript language for

00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:14,700
the guys who are new to UI they'll find

00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:17,860
slightly difficult to learn it and

00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:19,330
reactors medium view is easy so these

00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,490
are the factor which will be considering

00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:22,720
why while choosing any framework

00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:24,490
obviously this is not the one then

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,860
another one backed by who is backing

00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:28,930
which company is actually backing up

00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,970
used by which company like angler is

00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:34,180
used by Google Wix

00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:35,590
PayPal HBO Sony GM similarly react is

00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,900
used by Facebook

00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,400
uber Airbnb Network Instagram Twitter

00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,260
you'll have that credibility in your

00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:44,050
mind like I this is the right framework

00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:45,190
I should be using and then view is the

00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:48,720
new framework done by one of the

00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:52,060
ex-googler and it is used by show me

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,890
Alibaba get Lara cast over other

00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:55,510
production files iOS development size

00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:57,340
all these like these are the factor

00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:59,220
which sometime matters to you and then

00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:01,960
which data binding is a bi-directional

00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:04,900
unidirectional what is the impact it has

00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,250
and then NPM weekly download it tells

00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,040
like which framework is getting more

00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:12,520
popularity in that terms and which model

00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,909
MVC virtual Dom because virtual Dom is a

00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,840
very

00:31:12,909 --> 00:31:18,789
a optimized way to render the DOM and

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,830
startup time which takes most out of

00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:23,259
time like angular has a longer because

00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:25,779
it is a big framework and reactors quake

00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:28,869
view is quick so complete valve apps can

00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:30,940
be used so reai angular can be used to

00:31:28,869 --> 00:31:32,559
create whole complete app itself because

00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,109
it is standalone it has everything in it

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,809
and react need to be integrative

00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:40,090
multiple tools because it is not a

00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:41,889
framework it's a library and view is

00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:43,989
like required third-party tools we are

00:31:41,889 --> 00:31:46,599
not used view much but these are their

00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:49,649
like kind of the most trending framework

00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:52,779
in the market and then when to use

00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:54,399
production angular is used in lot of

00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:55,960
production grade application and it is

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,899
meant for enterprise level bigger

00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,940
applications and react as production

00:31:58,899 --> 00:32:02,470
ready obviously and custom apps it is

00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,509
used in lot of custom apps more apps

00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:06,070
will being used and few J's is currently

00:32:04,509 --> 00:32:08,679
used and startups and some production

00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:11,559
apps where of the star if you look at it

00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:13,779
53 K for angular it looks like it's

00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:15,279
still a production grade enterprise

00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:17,409
level applicants still if you look at it

00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:20,590
is the number of stars for view is more

00:32:17,409 --> 00:32:21,849
reactors lesser once you look at the

00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:24,429
trend in the next slide you get to know

00:32:21,849 --> 00:32:27,519
how each one is getting the traction in

00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:29,349
the market so when you go over what is

00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,909
it somebody behind these slides is more

00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:34,299
like angular is a complete framework

00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:36,460
which any modern developer needs so it

00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:38,559
has everything end to end but in case of

00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:40,929
react is just a library it's not a

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,849
framework you need different kind of

00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:45,190
tools and libraries to be used alongside

00:32:42,849 --> 00:32:47,499
with it gives you flexibility but

00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:48,609
sometimes developer who are new will get

00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:50,259
into this problem which one should I

00:32:48,609 --> 00:32:52,269
pick so that is the kind of problem

00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:54,840
there so you know to accordingly choose

00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:57,549
it and then view is a combination of

00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,960
react and angular the guy has a case

00:32:57,549 --> 00:33:01,119
studies both the frameworks and then

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,119
actually root it and that's why it is

00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:05,559
getting a lot of traction ok interest

00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:07,659
over the last 5 where if you look at it

00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:12,909
how the interest of the developers over

00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:15,070
the last 5 years so if you look at the

00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:16,720
red line this is the angular it is going

00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:19,389
like initially it was on the top and

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,669
when you note my timeline and evolution

00:33:19,389 --> 00:33:23,619
of Big Data goers and when showing like

00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:26,860
angular was picking up picking up around

00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:29,080
post 2016 it's starting

00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:31,960
react is starting taking over this part

00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:34,210
and now react is going ahead in market

00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,740
and angular is still stabilized and it's

00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:37,990
still used for lot of production grade

00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,820
application so if you see this plant

00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,799
this is from Google I have picked up if

00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:43,899
you look at it this is how we also

00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:45,700
evolve ourselves it's not like this the

00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:48,039
graph made by me is like from Google you

00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,779
can find out even get this report and it

00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:51,399
actually matches how we evolved it

00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:53,500
because we are now moving towards react

00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:54,820
we are still using angular but mostly we

00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,010
are moving towards the air to create a

00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,149
tool and on top of that pool you want to

00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:04,179
make sure even developers can develop

00:33:58,149 --> 00:34:07,600
using plugins system so let me show you

00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:11,580
a quick demo of Network load advisor it

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:14,589
is built using one of this UI toolkit

00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:17,109
the problem was Telecom customers were

00:34:14,589 --> 00:34:19,419
facing these problems they didn't have a

00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:22,089
lot of call drops they were having bad

00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:25,240
browsing experience so this is what kind

00:34:22,089 --> 00:34:28,089
of use cases we were solving and then we

00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:30,940
come out with this small product network

00:34:28,089 --> 00:34:33,580
load advisor which was actually showing

00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:35,080
the network engineers what is happening

00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,820
in the network right now immediately on

00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:39,570
the system so let me quickly show you

00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,570
the demo here

00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,929
so currently what is happening is in

00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:56,369
particularly New York downtown the

00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:58,820
network engine is currently looking at

00:34:56,369 --> 00:35:01,350
what is happening on different nodes and

00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:03,480
particularly near to the Brooklyn Bridge

00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:05,250
there is a you note B which is totally

00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,810
red because it is there is some problem

00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:08,369
there fully congested I don't know

00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:11,520
whether you read it well because of the

00:35:08,369 --> 00:35:12,570
resolution so an engineer will go here

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,160
and he'll click on it

00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:15,900
he'll see how many do i ot device

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,160
selected how many users are using it

00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,200
what kind of application they are

00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:21,960
watching he'll go inside it and say ok

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,510
on the cell ID this purse these guys

00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,790
were connected and these there are few

00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:29,040
parameters like bandwidth packet loss

00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:30,960
congestion 99% application means

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,369
congested areas being congested that

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,260
cell is concerned these are the three

00:35:32,369 --> 00:35:36,780
guys who are actually doing tethering

00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:38,520
and blocking the whole system so he'll

00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:42,840
say I'll enforce a policy on them I'll

00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:46,280
put throttle heavy tiddlers and when you

00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:49,170
apply this policy then it reduce

00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:51,150
quickly reduce the congestion to stereo

00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:52,740
percent so similarly this was like a

00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:55,020
operator is doing it and later on what

00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:57,750
we did is this is a closed loop decision

00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:00,359
where machine itself can see okay this

00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:02,580
is there now let me make these guys

00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:05,040
throttle so this is how we kind of

00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:06,840
solved lot of use cases regarding these

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:11,400
things so this is the application which

00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:13,740
we quickly develop using this our UI kit

00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:18,020
so let me quickly show you our UI kit

00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:18,020
also have unable to access

00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:42,440
I know how visible is this because of

00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:45,380
the resolution I think so this is a kit

00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:49,490
we have developed using angular so it

00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:50,480
offers like it gives you oughtn't

00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:52,250
occasion of her ization

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,590
it gives you switcher it gives you top

00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:56,690
navigation bar so it gives you multiple

00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:58,850
modules through configurations it gives

00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:01,640
you offline data factory error handling

00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:04,100
unit testing a docker build so we have

00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:06,590
created a kind of starter app for our

00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:08,180
application our developers which can be

00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:09,290
used and they can quickly develop these

00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,060
applications these are the couple of the

00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:12,680
application which are built using this

00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:14,720
scale and on the long term we are

00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,100
thinking why don't we contribute this to

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,500
open source currently it's in-house

00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:20,360
because we're mostly earlier we are not

00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,490
using lot of contribution to open source

00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,080
when we started working with superset we

00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,280
realize this is that this is the way we

00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,840
should be going we should be

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,730
contributing because when you want to

00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,650
reboot people will start using it they

00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:34,300
will also fix it back whatever you have

00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:37,690
and they will give a new vision to it so

00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,690
we go back

00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:52,039
how to choose open sales tool we talked

00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:53,779
about how to choose a custom framework

00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:54,769
another thing is how to choose the

00:37:53,779 --> 00:37:57,019
open-source tool there are a lot of

00:37:54,769 --> 00:37:59,089
tools in market we initially looked at

00:37:57,019 --> 00:38:00,710
cabana super sector fauna and then we

00:37:59,089 --> 00:38:03,559
decided first thing how to choose it

00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:06,499
define a target persona who are the user

00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:08,539
own to use it what are the use cases if

00:38:06,499 --> 00:38:10,430
it is drag drop based do you need to

00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:12,499
code it because usually business

00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:14,150
analysts project managers they wanted to

00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:17,180
have some kind of just drag drop based

00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:18,559
UI and then your vision should match

00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:20,269
this with open so that's important we

00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:21,739
already talked about it and then pros

00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:23,749
and cons is more like quick

00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:25,069
time-to-market easy to use consistent

00:38:23,749 --> 00:38:27,499
look and feel in our case we were able

00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:29,329
to deploy it quickly start using it it

00:38:27,499 --> 00:38:30,920
has obviously for looking field we have

00:38:29,329 --> 00:38:32,660
to work initially but once it is there

00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,299
then it's like available to all our

00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:37,190
products cons are like new feature

00:38:35,299 --> 00:38:39,529
addition takes longer because in open

00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:41,089
source nothing is in your hand always

00:38:39,529 --> 00:38:44,059
because you know to go through a proper

00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:46,190
commit cycle even for the design PRS you

00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:48,499
need to put it so it takes time

00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,819
architecture learning there is steep

00:38:48,499 --> 00:38:52,219
learning curve in architecture because

00:38:49,819 --> 00:38:53,809
it is not your own defined so you have

00:38:52,219 --> 00:38:55,219
to make sure you learn the architecture

00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:57,529
well so that you live to contributed

00:38:55,219 --> 00:38:59,329
better then upgrade problems if you

00:38:57,529 --> 00:39:01,789
customize it it's not really extendable

00:38:59,329 --> 00:39:03,529
like if you have your own Fork and later

00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:06,200
on if you want to customize do something

00:39:03,529 --> 00:39:09,650
then merging itself is a problem you

00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:11,329
know upgrade is a problem lot of tools

00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:13,249
available in market from open source to

00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:16,190
pay like Cubana then there is a key be

00:39:13,249 --> 00:39:18,859
with the page who paid to off return on

00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:20,809
top of cabana super said Rafa not Google

00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:22,279
it a platform power bi tableau Amazon

00:39:20,809 --> 00:39:27,049
quick inside the lot of tools available

00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:29,119
from paid to open source so then we when

00:39:27,049 --> 00:39:31,729
we were working on one of the network

00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,499
security project we realized like kibana

00:39:31,729 --> 00:39:37,119
we start to use it has a lot of search

00:39:33,499 --> 00:39:40,309
use cases then we realized we should be

00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,079
looking at Cabana and Cabana is a open

00:39:40,309 --> 00:39:44,660
source tool for visualizing exploring

00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:48,410
and managing monitoring the entire ALK

00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:51,349
it has aggregation filter search it

00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:54,650
supports variety of charts time series

00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:57,440
map etc pros and cons if I talked about

00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:58,789
it quickly plug-in model plug-in based

00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,960
model for cabana is very good you can

00:39:58,789 --> 00:40:02,570
install what

00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:04,430
you want quickly then uninstall it very

00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:05,930
good for elastic and search cues kisses

00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:08,240
good variety of graphs and visuals

00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:09,890
create cook dashboard cons are like not

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,869
able to connect to multiple data sources

00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:14,210
natively that was the big problem we

00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:17,030
kind of left given a because of that

00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:19,010
heavily dependent on elastic angularjs

00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:20,780
base code was there it was migrating to

00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:22,130
react so developers were kind of like

00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:24,950
they were wanted to work on the latest

00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:26,990
one and then we finally found like a

00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:29,210
patch a super set it was an incubation

00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:30,980
and it has then it was matching a lot of

00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:33,349
our requirements so enterprise ready

00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:36,140
business web application which gives you

00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:39,680
drag drop based interface to quickly

00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:41,240
build - modes so it has rich set of

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,810
visualization like 50-plus visualization

00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:47,630
it already supports it has charged you

00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:49,910
specialization time series elastic level

00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:51,740
sorry enterprise level role big role

00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:54,020
based access control you it already

00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:57,230
supports it connects to all the

00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:59,690
different databases open ID LDAP or auth

00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:01,400
it's a cloud data from day one itself

00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,750
you can because nowadays everybody is

00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,150
moving towards cloud this is cloud

00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:06,619
native support multiple data sources we

00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:08,150
talked a lot about it this was the one

00:41:06,619 --> 00:41:10,730
of the key deciding factor for us to

00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:13,550
move into this direction and then SQL

00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:15,680
lab remember we talked about you need to

00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:17,540
have some kind of SQL query mechanism in

00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,830
your tool so this already offers you a

00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:22,369
SQL lab where you can write your own

00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:24,560
queries individualize them part of htv-3

00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:26,750
roto it is being accepted in HTTP SDP so

00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,310
it is a great way to see like it is

00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,960
being accepted in the market growing in

00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:33,320
community and penetration if you look at

00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,940
these are the Apache Incubator starts

00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,980
how many commits are there what are the

00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:40,820
how many contributors you can go through

00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:44,000
all these details so I will skip through

00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:45,619
this because we have short of time so if

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,160
I time permit will come back to this we

00:41:45,619 --> 00:41:50,660
have created a anomalous devices in the

00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:53,390
network you are trying to find an honest

00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:58,190
devices across a particular area I want

00:41:53,390 --> 00:42:00,980
to visualize using super set why to use

00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:03,020
that contribute to open source why you

00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:06,109
should be doing that first it's time to

00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:08,300
market because you are ready with the

00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:10,849
day one itself within few days you are

00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:12,850
ready to go to your customer if you are

00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:15,400
writing your own obviously you

00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:16,900
taking time then improve the code

00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,280
quality because everybody is working and

00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,050
combinated towards making a betterment

00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,780
for this code so it'll be really helpful

00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:24,730
if you take it and then reduce the cost

00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:26,050
obviously dollars will reduce because a

00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:27,910
lot of people are already building those

00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:30,460
features you are adding some part of it

00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:32,260
and then component again competitive

00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,790
advantage because everybody is working

00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:35,200
towards the betterment of that tool as

00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:37,840
well as if you're contributing you are

00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:45,610
also working with those people and you

00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:47,320
become sharpen yourself then to make

00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:49,210
software more usable because everybody

00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:51,340
is working toward a single goal to make

00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:53,940
that application more stable and usable

00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:55,720
so it becomes automatically more usable

00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:58,930
excel your career because you have

00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:00,970
working in open source community and you

00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:02,680
are known to people you showcase your

00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:04,120
work in community you automatically

00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:07,240
Excel your career because people will

00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:08,500
reach out to you then is you support

00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,360
open source value that's why you do it

00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,710
promote industry standard because of

00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,900
promoting industry standard if you are

00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:15,490
looking at that and the final thing is

00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:17,500
like give that I wanted to give back to

00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:18,670
community because I have used these

00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:23,290
things I want to give back to the

00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:26,800
community also design UI for future

00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:30,880
what should be our thinking towards and

00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:32,530
designing the feature of the UI so

00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,730
pluggable architecture bringing new item

00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:36,640
in the system you need to think whenever

00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:38,410
you creating a framework or to are

00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,730
choosing it you need to look at it like

00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:42,550
plugin system should be there black

00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:45,580
Cabana has very good plug-in system I

00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:47,470
was talking to max on super set like

00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:50,500
whether we can build that particular

00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:52,900
feature in super set itself where I can

00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,910
able to plug and play different

00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:56,800
visualizations could add my own custom

00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:59,770
modules so that'll be really helpful and

00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,300
it can go to the next level then

00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:02,500
configurable and low for it meant it

00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,720
should be low footprint because now

00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:06,520
people are going towards light devices i

00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,620
devices so it has to be there and

00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,900
responsive UI obviously this is a key

00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:13,270
factor whenever you are doing something

00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:17,620
because it has to be going laptop tablet

00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:19,420
mobiles and then multi model UI so this

00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:21,280
is basically because now your

00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:23,110
interaction mode is not just the user

00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,240
interface it's like a voice also you are

00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:26,599
doing so now the world is moving toward

00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,309
a different direction where

00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:30,229
interacting with machines using your

00:44:28,309 --> 00:44:31,700
voice your hand touch all that stuff so

00:44:30,229 --> 00:44:33,680
you need to think in that direction also

00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:35,989
from development perspective next is

00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,329
spatial interfaces virtual reality

00:44:35,989 --> 00:44:40,220
augmented reality mixed reality so these

00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:43,249
are the things which is right now not

00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:46,460
available in the actual human being 11

00:44:43,249 --> 00:44:48,049
not available to the real market it is

00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,940
still in development in the rnd

00:44:48,049 --> 00:44:51,859
so this is the next wave which is coming

00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:54,650
up last last year I attended about the

00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:56,769
face book conference there they were

00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:59,900
showing it a properly virtual based

00:44:56,769 --> 00:45:01,279
application where I am kind of talking

00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:03,079
to all my friends in a party in a

00:45:01,279 --> 00:45:05,839
virtual environment so that kind of

00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:07,819
thing is the picking of very fast an

00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:09,680
extra variable like I watch so this is

00:45:07,819 --> 00:45:10,880
the new thing which already everybody is

00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,769
most of the guys are using already

00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,430
variables and this is the next market

00:45:12,769 --> 00:45:15,430
where we are heading

00:45:15,999 --> 00:45:21,319
thank you this is my twitter handle and

00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:22,789
please contact me for any ui/ux problem

00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:31,130
big data analytics I would love to her

00:45:22,789 --> 00:45:32,869
answer that sorry I didn't understand

00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:34,160
the difference is it was at the

00:45:32,869 --> 00:45:36,349
beginning of your presentation between

00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,569
reports and offline data

00:45:36,349 --> 00:45:40,940
okay so reports are basically what

00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:42,890
happens is whenever you building big

00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:45,920
data application there are certain areas

00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:47,599
which extract data in hours you're

00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,059
running where it takes like six hours

00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,890
and hours to get the data so user cannot

00:45:50,059 --> 00:45:53,359
wait on the interface itself so what you

00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:54,890
need to do is in to convert those use

00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,599
cases into the reporting you should have

00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:59,539
to use some kind of reporting tool where

00:45:56,599 --> 00:46:00,890
you either generate them automatically

00:45:59,539 --> 00:46:03,079
or user will configure them when I

00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:05,119
should need it like weekly monthly daily

00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:06,680
and then you will get an email and we

00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,269
can or from interfacing and go there and

00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,249
download that report there are multiple

00:46:08,269 --> 00:46:11,960
ways that is one of the key aspects has

00:46:10,249 --> 00:46:13,450
to use in reporting and for talking

00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:16,279
about the offline data is more like

00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:18,319
while doing and UI development what

00:46:16,279 --> 00:46:19,999
happens is back-end is not available

00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,739
immediately your developers can do

00:46:19,999 --> 00:46:23,719
quickly but back-end takes longer time

00:46:21,739 --> 00:46:24,950
so what they do is they usually define

00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:28,160
an interface between front-end and

00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:29,390
back-end which is a PI contract and what

00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,599
they do is they kind of do a simulation

00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:35,630
of JSON objects or CSV they can put it

00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:37,640
and then in UI they want to they use

00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:39,259
that offline data to create their UI

00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,400
because if you look at the load advisor

00:46:39,259 --> 00:46:42,470
it was all

00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,500
through the offline data factory I will

00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:47,000
just mimic all the responses there and

00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:49,220
later on once they pay is available I

00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,930
switch on my flag application now move

00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:52,640
to the online mode it directly connects

00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:55,670
to the server and get the same data

00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,500
because the contract is finalized so

00:46:55,670 --> 00:47:02,349
development can go faster

00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:05,690
nothing tanked another question we got

00:47:02,349 --> 00:47:07,250
regarding in your experience because you

00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:09,559
mentioned very quickly the proprietary

00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:12,039
tools and from my experience people

00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:15,230
always won't because I've been using

00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:18,319
Excel of course but also poor bi or

00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:25,730
tableau or MicroStrategy for years in

00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:27,140
your experiments how I mean well are you

00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:32,420
more confronted with the proprietary

00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:34,339
tools or do you are you often are you

00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:37,339
often asked to develop specific your

00:47:34,339 --> 00:47:38,630
eyes so depending on the deed because we

00:47:37,339 --> 00:47:40,339
are moving towards where we don't want

00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:42,950
to develop too many things we want to

00:47:40,339 --> 00:47:45,799
have a tool which can create us for us

00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:48,200
faster and trend is moving towards that

00:47:45,799 --> 00:47:50,390
because next wave is where we want like

00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:52,670
anybody can create big data application

00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:54,470
not just experts so that is the world

00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:58,369
where we are moving and our applications

00:47:54,470 --> 00:48:00,650
are being moved did I answer my question

00:47:58,369 --> 00:48:04,400
was not very clear ok so you can repeat

00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:05,750
the question no no never mind but I have

00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:09,099
another question that's more interesting

00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:14,380
to me you didn't speak at all about

00:48:09,099 --> 00:48:16,520
about pagination which is basically

00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:18,440
depending the components because it's

00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:20,299
more like whenever using a component

00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:22,250
they have like a G grid views a lot a G

00:48:20,299 --> 00:48:24,349
greater has the built-in pagination and

00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:26,329
you can have a virtual scroll or you can

00:48:24,349 --> 00:48:27,710
so depending on your need so that is the

00:48:26,329 --> 00:48:29,390
basic things we have in our compared

00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:30,920
these days ok because it's a really

00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:31,940
believer it is available because earlier

00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,299
it was the kind of thing which was

00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,160
missing

00:48:32,299 --> 00:48:35,990
now people have developed it for so

00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,000
everybody is available okay so other

00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:40,180
questions I want more kickstand for you

00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,470
and it's not very clear to me how you

00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:44,119
deal with the raw data because in big

00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:46,579
data normally you have raw data stored

00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:48,500
in HDFS also so how do you deal with

00:48:46,579 --> 00:48:50,029
that before you come to the

00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,710
visualization part ok

00:48:50,029 --> 00:48:53,560
so in our case what we have our own

00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:55,510
platform where we

00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:57,880
have spark job running and putting the

00:48:55,510 --> 00:49:00,220
data into hive and then for custom you

00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:02,110
guys we have a REST API layer your

00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,790
back-end which fetch this daytime this

00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:05,770
is contract between you a fronting which

00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:07,450
actually populates the data but in next

00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:09,070
case we're using super set we are

00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:11,230
directly reading from hive that was the

00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:12,910
intent to go towards a tool where it can

00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:14,560
directly connect to heii there's no UI

00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:15,760
back-end in between but i think is you

00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:18,280
cannot do everything there right now

00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,570
because it offers you a few features but

00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,640
not everything that's why there's a

00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:27,220
custom framework which is needed for

00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:28,600
some enterprise applications ok ok thank

00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:30,600
you thank you very much thank you very

00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:34,949
much

00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:34,949
