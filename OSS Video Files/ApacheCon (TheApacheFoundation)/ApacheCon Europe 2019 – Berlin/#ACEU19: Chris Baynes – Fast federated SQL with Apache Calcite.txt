Modern data landscapes are large and complex. Calcite provides functionality to query across databases and optimizes for effective push-down of filters, aggregations, and joins. This makes it an ideal gateway for SQL access to data. However, for analytical queries that require fast responses, this may not be enough.

During this session we discuss ways to speed up difficult queries and reduce the load on underlying database servers.
