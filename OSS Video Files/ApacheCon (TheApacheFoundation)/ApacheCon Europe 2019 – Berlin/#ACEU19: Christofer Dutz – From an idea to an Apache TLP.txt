About 3 years ago, I had an idea of using Open-Source software to create the next generation of industrial it solutions. 

At ApacheCon 2017 in Miami I introduced this idea to the public with my "Building SCADA systems with Apache Software". 2019 the Apache PLC4X project is an Apache TLP. 

In this talk I will not talk about technical details of the project itself, but all the steps we took on this journey from a community-building point of view. Starting way before writing the first line of code. 

After these last two years, I would claim that "community-building" is by far the most challenging task when initiating a new project, but it's also seems to be one we tend to treat as second-class citizens - even in established projects. Hopefully I will be able to show you how rewarding community-building can be ... 

After all: Apache is all about community over code and it's that way for a reason

so first of all Who am I well my name is

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,950
Christopher Dodd

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,929
I work as

00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:14,780
tea consultant for a company called code

00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:17,779
centric but I have always been sort of a

00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:20,330
total open source enthusiast sort of

00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:23,990
currently I'm sort of committed at sort

00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:27,050
of 10 Apache projects a member of the

00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:29,869
foundation and well since sort of half a

00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:35,899
year I'm allowed to call myself VP of

00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:38,840
Apache PLC 4x so the thing is being a

00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:42,410
senior IT consultant in a place near

00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,600
Frankfurt it's sort of like well you

00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:49,220
work mainly for insurance companies and

00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:52,070
banks but the thing is I always liked it

00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:54,500
when things move sort of if if there is

00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:56,900
an engine running if you can sort of

00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,760
trigger anything any movement or

00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:02,690
anything in the real world I always

00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,489
loved that and I thought the industry is

00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,770
full of interesting opportunities and

00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:09,649
for the past two years it sort of

00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,780
started that the entire industry is

00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:15,499
everything about it's all about industry

00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:17,929
4.0 doesn't matter what you really think

00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:19,939
about the term industry 4.0 but it

00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:23,840
always boils down to sort of cloud stuff

00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:26,359
big data machine learning and I really

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,869
wanted to do these types of industrial

00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:31,969
projects and sort of it looked like it

00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:34,130
should be quite a good idea to sort of

00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:35,630
get working in this stuff because it

00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:38,560
doesn't really matter what you look for

00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:43,399
the charts always sort of look the same

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:47,179
so what I did was as well there weren't

00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:49,999
very many industrial IOT projects out

00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:52,659
there I started test balloon and I did

00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:56,020
that by sort of just submitting a paper

00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:59,049
building SCADA systems with open-source

00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:01,909
to Apache con in Miami

00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:03,469
yeah one of the people on the picture is

00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:06,020
sitting down there

00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:08,539
first of all Apache called Miami that

00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,000
was really awesome and what I really

00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:13,880
liked was sort of it was for me it was a

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,370
test balloon I had no idea was the talk

00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,829
on a be accepted well okay that was

00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:22,430
settled pretty fast but is anybody gonna

00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:23,690
show up and it turned out well it was a

00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,640
full house

00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,100
I got lots and lots of positive

00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,950
responses even after the conference I

00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,290
kept on getting contacted by people

00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:37,370
asking me is this gonna happen now I

00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:40,130
really need this so having an idea is

00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:42,620
one thing having the opportunity to do

00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:46,100
it is a different one so I was sort of

00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,600
lucky because the company I worked for

00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,820
they had something called innovation

00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,450
budget it's sort of like a certain

00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:55,070
percentage of the revenue sort of gets

00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:57,080
goes into a fund and if you've got a

00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:59,900
good idea you can apply for this and

00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,360
well it happens to be that I was one of

00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:05,330
the first people to get access to this

00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,890
budget and it was the idea to build an

00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,500
open-source library for communicating

00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:12,290
with industrial hardware initially they

00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,900
gave me six months for initiating the

00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:18,500
project and and I got to start working

00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:20,780
on it in October to 2017 we never really

00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,850
thought of doing this sort of like a

00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:26,510
closed forest thing because first of all

00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:29,930
we were all pretty focused on open

00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:31,760
source and sort of building a product

00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,070
well then you have to have all the sales

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,200
you have to have this support and and

00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:38,390
all this stuff that well tech guys

00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,850
usually don't have that much fun with

00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:44,320
but open source that's the thing we knew

00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:47,420
so it was our idea to simply do this and

00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:50,720
sort of earn some money with the the

00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:53,570
contracts that we get after that so was

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,670
was nice there's six months they got a

00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:58,489
little bit extended so for the past two

00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:04,130
years I've been working 100% of my time

00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:06,320
on Apache PLC 4x so but as we're not

00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:08,239
really talking about the project itself

00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:12,890
but how we got things into the incubator

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,480
well one of the things you always have

00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:19,100
to do is find a name for the thing you

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,989
want to do so same as with the

00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,850
incubating projects well you can come

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:24,410
with any name into the incubator but if

00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:27,440
you ever want to graduate you have to

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:30,350
have a real name and it's sort of not

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,410
not like just picking I want to do

00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:35,870
Apache foo you really have to do some

00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,040
research and so here you've got a little

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,890
screenshot

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,430
one of the pages I created I think the

00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:47,060
name list was sort of 200 names long I

00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:50,860
started with I had the idea I wanted a

00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:53,690
catchy name I thought I always loved

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,670
projects that have names sort of around

00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:58,340
animals because if you've got an animal

00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:01,010
name you get to get an animal mascot and

00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,330
I always loved animal mascots don't

00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,880
don't ask me why I just wanted it that

00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:07,850
way so I was looking for animal names

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:12,170
with a P and L and a C in it yeah I

00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:14,540
found stuff like Pelican sort of

00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:16,220
pelicans I don't think I hope no

00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,680
pelicans offended but I sort of don't

00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:22,280
think the pelicans are cute but then I

00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,790
found a Palm Civet our first idea was

00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:28,580
well let's call it Apache Palm Civet

00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:32,480
sort of name wasn't taken there wasn't

00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:34,010
any any usage of that outside of the in

00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,780
the software sector so that would have

00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:38,030
been safe but we in the end we decided

00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,130
yeah well even if Palm Civet is sort of

00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:43,250
cute it's sort of a stupid name for an

00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:45,560
for a project so in the end we sort of

00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,390
decided to go for a technical name as

00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:51,080
we're talking to PLC's well let's call

00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:53,900
it PLC for Jay but yeah well but we

00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:57,200
didn't want to talk to only job via Java

00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:59,780
but also others so oh well let's call it

00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,600
PLC for X and what you can see here is

00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:06,770
sort of all the research we did sort of

00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:10,010
you can see PLC welds PLC control PL

00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:11,780
controls all the sorts of stuff but in

00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:14,180
order to pick a name it sort of has to

00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:18,110
be not a registered trademark in the

00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:20,150
u.s. in Europe in India in China and

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:23,060
you're sort of expected to sort of do a

00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:25,820
little research on github on SourceForge

00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:29,540
and all these platforms if there is sort

00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:32,180
of not an excess usage of this because

00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:36,020
then it would be hard for a patchy to

00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:39,950
sort of protect the the trademark well

00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:43,460
PLC for X there was only a company in

00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:45,680
Russia had in the end of the 80s they

00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,390
had a little device to attach their

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,490
proprietary hardware to some other

00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,780
proprietary hardware and that thing was

00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:54,620
called peals for Expo

00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:58,100
it wasn't used that much so in the end

00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:00,730
we settled with PLC 4x we decided to do

00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,260
that early because renaming is really

00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:05,810
evil I've seen that once or twice with a

00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:08,480
patchy project to rename it you have to

00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,250
change all the group IDs and may even

00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,560
the artefact IDs you have to change the

00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,240
packages you have to change the the

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,640
documentation so we wanted to start with

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,520
this real

00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:21,770
so also deciding about names well you

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,650
gotta set up your toys as we're talking

00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:28,990
to real Hardware well we sort of set up

00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:31,760
a an IOT lab in our office so I've just

00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:34,520
screwed some of these rails on the walls

00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,770
and just plugged on the hardware set up

00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,260
a little network and set up a VPN that

00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:44,120
you could dial into so that was sort of

00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:47,150
the kickoff as I said I always loved cut

00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,400
the cute animals as project logos so

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,200
having started this in a commercial

00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,140
company you get access to shared

00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,510
services so I got to ask our designer to

00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,970
sort of develop something and if I

00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:01,760
hadn't known how much work designing a

00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:05,510
logo like this is I probably would have

00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:07,370
not asked her to but she literally draw

00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:09,640
through hundreds and hundreds of

00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:12,860
sketches this is just a little part of

00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:15,590
what she did I've got a bigger picture

00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:20,300
and her whole desk is full of pencil

00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:24,050
sketches and different versions but in

00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,910
the end this was Toddie

00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,600
we called him Tati because sort of a

00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:29,180
Palm Civet

00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,970
in English is called a toddy cat so we

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:35,300
just stuck with a toddy that's why I'm

00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:38,930
that way so he's really great for

00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:41,650
t-shirts and swag stickers and stuff

00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:44,410
like that so that is important but

00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:47,150
project is not only a name a logo and

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:49,250
stuff like that well you also have to do

00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:51,830
things and the strange thing is you

00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,960
can't sort of start a project at Apache

00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,760
without having a single line of code or

00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,160
something like that it sort of have to

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,200
cede it outside and then bring it in it

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,900
would have been possible to set it up at

00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,000
Apache but it would have taken jumping a

00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,310
lot more hoops so we just decided

00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:14,030
to set it up in our company and just

00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:17,510
start coding so October 2017 well we had

00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:20,930
our first version of PLC 4x that was

00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:23,120
able to talk to an s7 device

00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:25,190
well actually this picture is fake

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,130
because that was the celebration to the

00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:32,330
second driver we did but oh well if I

00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:34,340
don't tell anyone nobody knows mmm so

00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:36,290
after we had sort of a little bit of

00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,240
source code we had our first drivers we

00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,830
had our first integration modules the

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,710
next step was preparing it for

00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:45,320
incubation so the first thing you have

00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:49,550
to do is find some Mentors I would

00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:52,460
suggest to choose mentors that are sort

00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:55,100
of a pain in the ass because the more

00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:58,850
you get done in the beginning the less

00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:01,820
you have to do later on so being a

00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:04,270
little bit masochistic I asked Justin to

00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:07,070
be our champion

00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:09,380
so the champion is sort of in the set of

00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:11,870
mentors it's the person who officially

00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:13,970
creates the accounts to set up the

00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,650
repositories I think their only reason

00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:17,089
isn't that if you've got four mentors

00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:19,160
and everybody creates the same

00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:21,050
repositories at the same time it sort of

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,330
sucks so that's why you have to find a

00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:25,520
champion and then you start preparing

00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:27,140
the incubation proposal so you start

00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,839
writing the text you go through it with

00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:31,610
your mentors and as soon as that's done

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:36,110
you just discuss the proposal on the

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:39,820
incubator mailing list so we ended up

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:44,360
entering incubation on December 28th

00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:48,010
2017 with our champion Justin McLean and

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:54,200
the other mentors were Greg traffic

00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:56,600
Luciano Zenda and Stefan boric and the

00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:00,350
reason I asked Justin to join was I knew

00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:03,290
how how he sort of has really detailed

00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:05,420
looks at the stuff he released so I

00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:08,420
think at the pod link shark tank in

00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:10,520
Vegas there was this new measure for pot

00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:13,040
being a real pod lling so people were

00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:17,270
treated as well you're a real puddling

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,800
if justin voted minus one on you we just

00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,749
yesterday we found out

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,300
sort of that was the one thing we failed

00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:25,279
because we actually never ever got a

00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:29,420
single - one from Dresden during the

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:32,449
whole incubation process so it was it is

00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:34,850
good to get the difficult or the let not

00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:37,670
the difficult but the ones that really

00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:40,119
do their job intensely try to get those

00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,119
Mentors

00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:47,389
so being accepted for incubation is one

00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:49,879
thing but now you have to sort of start

00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:51,860
incubation you do that by sort of if you

00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:55,220
started at a company and you started

00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:58,269
working at during your working hours

00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:03,649
well your company has to file a ççla

00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:05,749
just because if you sign an icy LA you

00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:07,429
sort of contribute everything you do to

00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:10,220
Apache but if you've got a signed

00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:11,749
working contract well you also sign that

00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,569
everything you do during your work time

00:12:11,749 --> 00:12:16,399
goes to the company so the ççla just

00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:18,949
sort of settles this and says yeah well

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,889
everything somebody does during the

00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:23,720
working time for an Apache project

00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:26,360
belongs to Apache so that was the first

00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,100
thing you had to do after that well you

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,259
have to sort of sign a software grant

00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:34,009
that the company sort of donates

00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:35,389
officially the codebase and everyone

00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:37,490
who's going to participate in the

00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:41,569
project who hasn't signed an I CLA first

00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:43,369
well that's what they have to do then so

00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:46,639
as soon as all the paperwork's done you

00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:48,920
get a git repository at Apache and well

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,589
that is sort of the the simplest thing

00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:54,799
yeah you just change the remote push it

00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:56,240
and your stuff is an Apache what's a

00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:59,269
little more difficult is sort of getting

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,279
your builds to four automated builds to

00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:03,980
run on Apache infrastructure because

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,829
well just having four if we started with

00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,809
git lab so if you move from get lab to

00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:11,329
jenkins well you have to sort of define

00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:13,699
those jenkins files and well you have to

00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:15,949
keep all the little things in mind that

00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:19,040
sort of maybe special on the apache

00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:20,660
infrastructure so another suggestion I

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,499
would give to you if you're looking for

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:26,720
a mentor take one mentor that is sort of

00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:28,519
strong on the legal side and then take

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,740
another one who's really good on

00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:32,620
understanding the infrastructure because

00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,670
getting those builds

00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:39,550
to run smoothly it might be a little

00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:41,350
challenging at the beginning as I said I

00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:43,480
did all the research for the paddling

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,890
name search first but you still have to

00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,500
do the official one it's sort of like

00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:50,830
yeah we want to name our project like

00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:53,530
this here we did all this research on it

00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:56,200
it's sort of not dangerous to use this

00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:58,450
name and well in the end if you get your

00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,270
public name search juror issues sort of

00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:04,120
approved well then you're allowed to

00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:07,090
sort of use that usually you have to do

00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:10,930
this before graduating we did it

00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:13,390
initially we also got our first version

00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:15,190
of the website online and we started

00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:17,230
everybody was signing up to the mailing

00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:19,750
lists and moving things to the mailing

00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:23,800
lists have to admit if you start a

00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:26,380
project in a company and you start

00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,870
moving to the mailing lists at Apache

00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:31,540
this is what I've discovered is the most

00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:35,200
challenging thing it's not technology

00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:38,230
it's people getting people to discuss

00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:43,360
things on a mailing list that is what I

00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:47,560
find that the most difficult part yeah

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,510
so unexpected challenges well getting

00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,090
all PP MC members to register to the

00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:54,670
mailing lists as I said yeah my mine on

00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:56,380
Apache colleagues yeah there was

00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:58,570
sometimes a colleague sitting next to me

00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,880
and he was always discussing things with

00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:03,550
me and I said please take this to the

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,160
list and he never did it until I finally

00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:07,600
said yes I have an answer for you but

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm not gonna give it to you if you

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,340
don't write it to an email so he was

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,960
sort of writing me an email and I was

00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,820
responding we were sitting two metres

00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:19,470
apart but this seems to have been the

00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,470
only way to get him to actually do it

00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:27,730
yeah so yeah I think we started with a

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:29,590
sort of 10 to 12 volunteers when I asked

00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:32,200
in my company sort of they all stuck up

00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:34,150
their hands yeah sure I'm in it in the

00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,400
end we were sort of two that were really

00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:39,040
active um

00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:41,560
so having done all the paperwork

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,680
everything set up well then you have to

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,310
do a lot of coding but let's say coding

00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,920
I would

00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:51,550
is sort of one-third of the work I had

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,650
to do in 2018 I'm intentionally saying I

00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:57,550
because in the beginning it was sort of

00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:59,920
just mainly me I was writing emails a

00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:01,390
lot of emails because if it's not on the

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,450
list it didn't happen even if you're on

00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:05,650
your own you sort of should sort of

00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:07,330
define what sort Goddard is sort of

00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:10,089
going through your head because if you

00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:13,360
don't do that who should be joining in

00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:17,050
so I was writing emails I was responding

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,839
to my own emails sometimes I was on the

00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:22,180
next morning I was even sort of replying

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,980
to my own emails with that's maybe not

00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,660
such a good idea maybe we should do it

00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:29,920
this way

00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:33,520
we started talking at about PLC for X at

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:37,390
meetups I started I submit I started

00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:39,460
submitting talks to this topic for all

00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:42,520
any conference that came across me I

00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:46,300
thought I just have to fire talks at

00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:49,420
every conference maybe one or two will

00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:53,170
get accepted well I ended up doing a

00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:55,450
little more than one or two I I was

00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:57,940
touring through Germany talking to

00:16:55,450 --> 00:17:01,000
companies interested in the topic so I

00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:03,610
went to Industrial fairs and went

00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,650
through the rows and and I talked to

00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:08,140
companies is this something interesting

00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:10,449
for you if they said yes I I visited

00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,189
them we did little workshops there I

00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:16,900
started writing articles for newspapers

00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:21,130
I did wrote articles for blogs well and

00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:25,179
even more a little bit coding so March

00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:27,970
2018 well we I got my first article on

00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:31,450
POC Forex and Apache agent on the cover

00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:33,940
of a magazine yeah so that was quite

00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:40,030
pretty I was pretty surprised to see

00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:42,220
that so this was this article was the

00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:44,800
first one who really got companies

00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:47,260
calling us because we were really

00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,810
talking about solving real problems they

00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:52,210
were having so growing a community is

00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:54,910
one thing growing interest in the

00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:58,929
product is a different one but both are

00:17:54,910 --> 00:18:02,020
very important and sort of I was

00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:04,840
thinking of how can I sort of well this

00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:07,660
appeal c4x this industrial communication

00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:11,200
saying this open source in the industry

00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:13,840
it's sort of something totally new and

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:17,110
things that are totally new you usually

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:20,980
have to sort of make stick so I thought

00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:25,750
I have to do something to sort of be

00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:30,220
remembered that people remember me so I

00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:32,410
made a real toddy there was this company

00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,760
in the u.s. called but seas where you

00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:36,730
could sort of if you've got kids and

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,310
they sort of squiggled some some some

00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:41,530
creature you can have it produced well I

00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:45,760
sent them the SVG from our project logo

00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:47,470
and had made a real toddy and so the

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,230
real reason why that happened was I

00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:52,600
think it was Shane in Apache con and

00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:56,590
Vancouver he was running around with

00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:59,860
this yellow elephant with the Hadoop

00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:03,730
elephant and I just remembered that

00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:06,760
whenever I think of that Apache con

00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:08,950
I always keep thinking of Shane running

00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,510
around with that elephant I thought why

00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:12,850
is that happening so I did a little

00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:15,040
research and the thing is if you do

00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:18,700
something that is sort of slightly out

00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:21,550
of the ordinary people get surprised and

00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,650
if people get surprised they remember

00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:26,290
what sort of made them surprised and if

00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:30,550
you sort of sort of in the tight typed

00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:33,880
time area around this surprise you tend

00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:36,370
to get remembered easily and well if you

00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,290
run around an industrial conference with

00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,240
a plush animal first of all well here

00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:42,370
the the strange nutjob running around

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,110
with a plush animal but it's always the

00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:45,670
plush animal you would definitely want

00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:47,560
to bring home for your kids or you just

00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:50,290
want one yourself so you start asking

00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:52,510
hey what's with the cat oh well you

00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:55,440
asked for it got a five minute peel t4x

00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:59,470
pitch and well in the end you just

00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,750
started to get remembered did a lot of

00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:04,480
traveling have to admit running running

00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:07,720
around with a plush animal you get a lot

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,440
of smiles and people are much kinder to

00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:15,749
you

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:17,549
yes so sort of July 2018 something

00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:18,690
strange happened I mentioned I was

00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:21,570
talking to myself

00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:23,820
replying to my own emails but all of a

00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:27,749
sudden this happened so this is a sort

00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:30,119
of email statistic and well this is sort

00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:33,119
of me probably talking to myself maybe

00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:35,759
Justin sort of agreeing or mostly

00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:37,830
disagreeing with things and then all of

00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:41,220
a sudden people started joining in there

00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:43,200
was new people coming in there was an

00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,059
insane amount of texting at the moment

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,090
and I have to admit that was the time

00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:50,249
when I sort of really felt like sort of

00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,200
I think if you if you're a parent and

00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:54,600
your kid is doing the first steps I

00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,269
think this must sort of be as proud as

00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,519
you are when you see something like this

00:20:56,269 --> 00:21:01,470
so around that time first people started

00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,570
up showing or started showing up on the

00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:05,730
lists stop started submitting bug

00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:07,379
reports and bug reports mean well they

00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:09,470
tried it out

00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:14,429
they started submitting pull requests

00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:17,869
and yeah and then 24th September we

00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:20,850
voted in our first new ppm C member and

00:21:17,869 --> 00:21:23,999
just two months later we had our first

00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:26,519
community meetup so Julian and his

00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:28,409
company sort of invited us to the area

00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:31,320
near Stuttgart and we had our first

00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:34,580
community Meetup and from thence that

00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:37,289
things started getting sort of more

00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:40,379
getting faster and faster because just

00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:42,269
sort of a month later we used something

00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:44,100
well at code centric we have sort of a

00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:46,859
let's say it it's a co-working space

00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:49,590
it's a finger on my Orca and we can sort

00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:52,559
of just book that for a week and just go

00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:55,379
there and just sort of lock the doors

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:58,590
well first bringing the beer then lock

00:21:55,379 --> 00:22:00,389
the doors and just get done and

00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:04,129
that's what we did so well you can see

00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:08,940
on the table well we were doing a lot of

00:22:04,129 --> 00:22:12,179
coding API discussions experimenting

00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:14,009
with new hardware and stuff yeah and we

00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:18,240
were processing a lot of really new

00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:20,970
input but well also a lot of beer but

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,190
the thing is that sort of seeded what I

00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:25,560
would call the PLC Forex

00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,750
because it was sort of our first hangout

00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,970
together and that's why I think stuff

00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:32,880
like patchy cons if you're talking to

00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:36,690
people on emails all the time that's one

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,400
thing you you get to know somebody but I

00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,170
think you really get to know someone if

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,930
you meet them if you talk to each other

00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:48,210
and that's what I love at Apache cones

00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:51,630
yeah so shortly after we came back from

00:22:48,210 --> 00:23:00,360
Majorca we had our first release so it

00:22:51,630 --> 00:23:01,260
was on 5th of October after that sort of

00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,290
yeah

00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:08,370
the rc1 I had to cancel myself because I

00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:10,740
noticed that I had no notice so glad I

00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:12,660
did that because otherwise well Justin

00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:16,410
would have voted minus one but I was

00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:17,940
faster also sort of sort of around that

00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:20,580
time we had our first major proof of

00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:25,050
concept so what you can see here is sort

00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:28,110
of the a sixty dollar setup of a

00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:31,200
Raspberry Pi with a aluminium casing and

00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:34,200
that sort of replaced I think eight

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:39,950
hundred thousand euro proprietary

00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:44,730
software and that was a lot faster so

00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:47,730
adoption started this was in Berlin in

00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:49,800
November last year I was speaking at a

00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:51,840
conference and I couldn't believe when I

00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,450
saw people sitting in the audience with

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,810
their laptops open I recognized the PLC

00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:59,640
Forex logo so I started getting a

00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:02,370
feeling that people are actually

00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:07,200
interested in what we're doing so in

00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:10,710
total 2018 I had 17 talks at conferences

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:13,200
and meetups I visited for industrial

00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:15,270
fairs where I sort of went around every

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,880
booth talking to everyone who wasn't

00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:20,340
sort of up in the trees when I counted

00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:23,490
to three had two articles and IT

00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:26,370
magazines three blogs posts and we

00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:28,710
really found formed a really great team

00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:29,610
and I have to admit I found lots and

00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,980
lots of new friends

00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:33,690
a lot of the people in the PLC Forex

00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:36,809
project they weren't they were

00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:39,749
completely new to Apache so we

00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:42,210
had to do a little of this teaching of

00:24:39,749 --> 00:24:44,610
the Apache way but sort of we there were

00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:46,620
experienced Apache members involved in

00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:48,779
the project so that was quite easy and

00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,909
well let's say the the individuals that

00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:54,029
came they sort of naturally sort of

00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:57,419
digged that dug that way so that was

00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:59,850
really great and sort of yeah III would

00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:05,639
be very sad if I sort of lost any of

00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:08,820
these people I met so first of laughs

00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:11,460
and well first four months of this year

00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:14,070
well we were working hard on creating

00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:17,519
C++ drivers Python drivers C sharp

00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:20,249
drivers especially driver ed generation

00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:22,799
but I'd say sort of the thing that

00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:25,139
sticks out was the pre graduation work

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,480
yeah if you want to graduate there's a

00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:29,940
big checklist of things you have to do

00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,619
it sort of like releases have to be done

00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,269
this way you have to be sure that your

00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:35,460
website has all the necessary

00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:37,649
information that everything is sort of

00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:40,860
done the right way so a lot of the work

00:25:37,649 --> 00:25:43,049
was sort of be a little bit well it's

00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:45,659
not as satisfying as writing a new

00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:51,149
driver but sort of getting all these

00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:56,460
check marks sort of green and yeah and

00:25:51,149 --> 00:26:01,350
on sort of round beginning of April I

00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:03,690
was able to sort of send out do all the

00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:07,590
stuff and he can see that I was very

00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:11,369
anxious to sort of do that because there

00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:15,360
were 199 top level projects as the ASF

00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:17,460
at the time the vote was over so I was

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,429
sitting there with my clock waiting till

00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:23,249
the 72 hours passed and I think I

00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:27,119
submitted it maybe 10 seconds after that

00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:30,539
pass so I had I think I had up there I

00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:33,869
had the emails with the result of the

00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:37,169
vote that was the email I prepared to

00:26:33,869 --> 00:26:39,690
Sally to start cranking up the marketing

00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:42,960
machine and down there I had the the

00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:46,470
submission for the board agenda to sort

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:50,059
of put us in the for the next board

00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:50,059
meeting to graduate

00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:59,289
yeah I think on the third screen I just

00:26:53,679 --> 00:27:04,690
had some good music yeah so everything

00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:08,049
went well and 17th of April 2019 we

00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:11,230
became the 200th top-level project of

00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:12,880
the ASF and that's when things started

00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:15,970
to get really interesting because sort

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:20,530
of two or three days after all this

00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:23,260
publicity stuff went out so the ASF sent

00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:26,169
out an official announcement and shortly

00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:28,960
after that you send out a blog post on

00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:31,059
the ASF blog then all the the company

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,130
sort of involved we always had we all

00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:36,130
had a sort of blog announcements

00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:38,710
prepared they were all sort of sunt to

00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:43,510
sort of be sent out in a certain

00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:47,559
sequence and I started being called by

00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:50,350
by guys from from Microsoft from sa P

00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:52,210
that was a totally crazy week and I

00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:54,549
think I didn't code a single line in

00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:58,120
that week because I was just phoning and

00:27:54,549 --> 00:28:00,640
calling people writing emails and one of

00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:03,340
the calls was somebody from the European

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,490
Commission because they were doing this

00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:09,280
yo fossa to project where they invited

00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:12,400
Apache projects to sort of come together

00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:16,360
and work together and well we were one

00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:23,409
of the lucky projects that got to do

00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:27,760
this trip yeah so have to admit that was

00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:31,120
real a lot of fun and then on the 24th

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,820
of May 2019 we had our first release as

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,700
a top-level project by the way that's me

00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:43,330
in the crocodile on the street parade I

00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:45,820
think yeah so doing one thing doing a

00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:47,919
thing you believe is interesting doesn't

00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:52,120
always mean that other people think that

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:54,909
way but if we log into our Apache Nexus

00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:59,230
we have this cool thing that we can sort

00:28:54,909 --> 00:29:02,770
of see how on maven central to download

00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:05,049
statistics are for our projects

00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:07,809
when I signed in and had a look at what

00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:10,330
peeled c4x was doing I was really happy

00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:12,700
we were sort of up to almost 7,000

00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:15,250
downloads per per month for a pretty new

00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:19,659
project that was that was quite quite an

00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:23,200
achievement I think so in total my

00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:26,440
summary for the incubation well creating

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,789
a new project is a lot of work it's not

00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,789
just about the coding

00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:34,419
I'd say community building is more is

00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:37,330
even harder than building code but also

00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:39,340
I have to say if I manage to talk to a

00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:43,870
new device I did a little victory dance

00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:46,210
and then I felt good but when I saw the

00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:49,270
community starting having people show up

00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:51,159
at our meetings doing these trips

00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:53,440
together meeting at Apache Khan's

00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:57,610
and that is far more rewarding than any

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:59,470
driver I could write going through

00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:03,520
incubation together sort of Titan's

00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:05,470
community I'd say because it sounds sort

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:09,010
of bad but you're all fighting the same

00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:12,520
fight together you all have to do the

00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:15,100
same thing and it's sort of at least it

00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:17,140
felt this way for me that this really

00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:20,230
brought the community together you get

00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:23,559
to know a lot of new people most of

00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:25,270
these I even say all of the people now

00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:27,460
involved in the peels of 4x project

00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:30,460
which I met through the PLC 4x project I

00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:33,700
would call friends if they sort of come

00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:38,470
nearby my place sure your your safe to

00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:40,179
crash on my couch and in the end I was

00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:43,559
even surprised that this whole process

00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:47,080
it can sort of be fun

00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:50,980
so looking back I do have some

00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:53,200
suggestions for the the existing

00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:57,520
paddling's or the paddling's that will

00:30:53,200 --> 00:31:01,390
start coming up invest a lot of time and

00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:03,279
community building and don't put up too

00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:05,260
many rules upfront there are one or two

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:08,080
incubating projects let's start with

00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:10,210
let's say five or six members and they

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,520
start yeah well

00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:16,540
review then commit everything in a

00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:19,360
feature branch and three people have to

00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:21,700
sign before merging and stuff like that

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,010
but that's what that's what you need if

00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:27,540
you've got a big project but guess what

00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:30,940
you're not you're a small project so

00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:33,550
don't start by sort of copying what the

00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,320
huge projects are doing just because the

00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:37,030
Maven project does it that way it

00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:40,750
doesn't mean you have to do it that way

00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:42,880
my suggestion is just put up rules start

00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:45,100
without rules and then start putting up

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,640
rules when they make sense if you notice

00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:50,320
that commit quality is poor then say

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,930
discuss it on the list

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,090
switch to review then commit otherwise

00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:57,940
there I don't see any any point in that

00:31:55,090 --> 00:32:00,340
you just sort of raise the the barrier

00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:04,330
for new people to come in invite people

00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:06,490
early you don't have to sort of submit

00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:08,650
pull requests for two years just to be

00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:11,620
proven that you're worthy just invite

00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:14,890
people early because then they start

00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:16,570
getting really active yeah

00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:21,430
as I mentioned don't do things like the

00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:23,520
big ones you're not and one real big of

00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:26,500
advice I would like to give you is

00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:29,790
accept advice from your mentors I

00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:31,410
mentioned we were project number 200

00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:34,300
well

00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:36,460
formerly we wouldn't have been because

00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:39,610
there was another pod link that sort of

00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:42,790
ended the vote before us sort of one or

00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:45,130
two weeks but during the incubation

00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:49,690
project a process they were always

00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:53,050
complaining and sort of they explicitly

00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:57,670
asked not not Mentors to not interfere

00:32:53,050 --> 00:33:00,010
with their doings so I did notice that

00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:03,760
they sort of finished the vote they

00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:06,430
submitted the result but they forget to

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,940
add to the board agenda and that's what

00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:10,360
counts

00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:14,290
so I just shut up I wasn't I wasn't

00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:18,520
interfering I got to submit number 200

00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:22,750
and well if they had listened maybe they

00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:23,260
would have been number 200 so what's to

00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,450
come

00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:28,390
I guess this applies to every Apache

00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:29,990
project not only incubating ones drawing

00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:32,029
of the community

00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:34,640
okay adding new languages will probably

00:33:32,029 --> 00:33:38,240
not apply to everyone but for us we want

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:41,980
to support more programming languages we

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,779
wanna add support for new protocols and

00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:47,929
especially all this working with other

00:33:44,779 --> 00:33:49,340
projects because a lot of projects I've

00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:53,090
seen out there they're sort of just

00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:55,070
concentrated on doing their thing but a

00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:57,559
project like Peel t4x it's sort of a

00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:59,500
framework it's sort of in between I

00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:03,440
would say it's the missing puzzle piece

00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:05,690
but that means it's not a picture on its

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,089
own it becomes part of a picture if you

00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:12,230
put it in place and this only works if

00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:14,839
you sort of sort of make it possible to

00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:16,580
integrate this puzzle piece into other

00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:18,560
people's picture so you have to start

00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:21,919
working together with other projects

00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,470
that was why I initiated this mailing

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:25,940
list I think this is one of the first

00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:30,139
Apache mailing lists that are sort of

00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:33,169
topic centric so the IOT at Apache org

00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:36,589
mailing lists is a mailing list sort of

00:34:33,169 --> 00:34:39,020
to enable the projects or people

00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:42,909
interested in the general topic of IOT

00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,909
to to communicate with each other

00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:48,980
currently a lot is happening at the

00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:51,770
Eclipse and the Linux foundations and so

00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:55,310
I'm also doing quite some work in sort

00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:57,650
of trying to reach out to these I think

00:34:55,310 --> 00:35:01,520
yesterday I had a talk with Roman with

00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:04,450
the LF edge Eve project I think if we

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:12,020
all work together we can really sort of

00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:15,910
kick some ass in the industry so thanks

00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:15,910
for listening I think I was on time

00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:25,569
so are there any questions

00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:28,119
yep this is really great Chris

00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:29,890
congratulations it's a great story the

00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:32,079
thing that I don't understand though is

00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:33,940
what's I mean you mentioned the

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,630
beginning of your talk that code centric

00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:39,940
is a sort of a financial services

00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:41,800
insurance focused company yet they

00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:44,410
sponsored this they paid for you to do

00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,440
this work for two years and maybe some

00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:48,280
other people what's their angle in it

00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,380
code centric is sort of like a

00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,380
consulting right IT consulting company

00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:55,990
so we've got all the sort of experts in

00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:59,859
Big Data machine learning cloud stuff

00:35:55,990 --> 00:36:03,430
and we really would like to stop doing

00:35:59,859 --> 00:36:05,260
well that that's my opinion but we would

00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:07,540
sort of like to do less for banks

00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:09,700
insurance companies and perhaps more for

00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:11,829
robots and production lines so you

00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:15,180
convinced and you convinced him to buy

00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:17,380
into your vision yeah yeah so it

00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:19,240
currently it wasn't possible for us to

00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:20,859
offer services to the production

00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:23,140
industry because we were just not able

00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:25,690
to talk to their hardware it was sort of

00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:27,819
a closed ecosystem and pizza for X was

00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:31,049
the the missing puzzle piece that let

00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:33,599
our open-source IT world talk to the

00:36:31,049 --> 00:36:37,390
operational ot world of the industry and

00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:40,210
as we thought well the the cake is so

00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:42,579
big and the demand is so high it doesn't

00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:45,910
really care if our competitors could

00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:50,700
also use Pizza 4x2 to do that because we

00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:50,700
just knew come on that market is so huge

00:36:52,200 --> 00:37:06,849
any other fans for the presentation I

00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:10,690
would like to know how have been your

00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:13,299
relationship with the industry giants

00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:16,630
Siemens all these guys because I guess

00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:19,030
that you are entering in a quite close

00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:22,900
war let's say and maybe I don't know you

00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:24,730
are like a challenging them or putting

00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,990
the risk I don't know it's a yeah I

00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:27,970
would like to know a bit about that

00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:30,520
that's actually a really really good

00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:32,770
question because it also shows some

00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,930
why it's good to sort of do something

00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:37,420
like this under the hood of a foundation

00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:39,520
and not under the hood of we'll just say

00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:41,830
a private repository at github or a

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,590
public repository at github because

00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:48,670
let's say the responses from the

00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:51,790
industry it was sort of very different

00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:55,570
some sort of let's say I could name him

00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:58,060
back off Vargo Phoenix Contact when I

00:37:55,570 --> 00:38:00,730
contacted them even Mitsubishi so when I

00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:04,420
contacted them they said this is a great

00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:07,360
idea what do you need they they provided

00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:09,970
us with specifications they even gave us

00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:12,490
grants to use the specification to

00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:14,560
implement drivers they all gave us

00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:16,630
hardware come on David they were sending

00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,670
in packets were coming in with

00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:20,710
industrial hardware they were just

00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:23,170
giving it to us because they believed in

00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:25,810
that there were other companies and

00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:29,640
usually the bigger and older ones and

00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:32,740
namely sort of I think the ABB guy

00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:36,550
threatened to sue me when I visited

00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:39,010
their booth Siemens was sort of a little

00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:41,860
bit of a little bit strange they sort of

00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:43,900
tended to switch between can we use your

00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:46,840
stuff and I will sue you it was sort of

00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:49,450
like depending on who you talk to it was

00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:53,260
either the one or the other

00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:55,630
generally they don't like us because I

00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:58,210
think the project has potential to

00:38:55,630 --> 00:39:00,340
ruined quite a bit of their business

00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:05,680
plans but have to admit I don't really

00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:08,580
care about that yeah and the thing is if

00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:11,950
we had done this for example in github

00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:15,100
or in a prior or in a code centric

00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:17,770
hosted repository the thing I was really

00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:20,200
afraid of was I made sure that

00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:25,180
everything we did was legally absolutely

00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:28,240
correct but being legally correct is one

00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:30,220
thing getting nuisance lawsuits is a

00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,770
different thing so the thing I was sort

00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:34,870
of afraid of was even that if I was

00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:37,330
doing everything correct having to go to

00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:40,600
court every now and then getting a

00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:42,850
lawyer doing all the preparation work

00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,930
and sort of it that that it would sort

00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:46,390
of start

00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:49,510
keeping me from doing the work I wanted

00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:53,020
to do just because they were well what

00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:55,150
does what does a big company care by

00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:57,790
just sort of filing one lawsuit after

00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:59,680
the other the good thing being at Apache

00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:02,200
well as soon as a letter comes in with a

00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:04,359
lawsuit I could say hey come on redirect

00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:08,680
this please to to the Apache Software

00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:10,780
Foundation and I think I I think big

00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:19,690
companies sort of would think twice

00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:22,570
before doing that any other well then

00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:25,690
thank you for coming I hope you learned

00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:29,849
something and I'm gonna be hanging

00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:29,849
around I'm gonna be the one with a cat

00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:35,980
