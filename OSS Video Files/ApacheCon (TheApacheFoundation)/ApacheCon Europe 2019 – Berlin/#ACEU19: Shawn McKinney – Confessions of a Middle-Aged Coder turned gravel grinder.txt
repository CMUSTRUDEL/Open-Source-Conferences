This talk discusses the journey of a middle-aged coder who transitioned from one who'd never ridden more than twenty miles into a hard-core endurance cyclist, specializing in tough gravel events like the Dirty Kanza.  

These are single day events between 150 and 210 miles, and are largely unsupported.  They cover challenging gravel and dirt roads in remote regions of the great plains, in places like Kansas and Nebraska.

The narrative includes a bit on the why and how, along with some of the most memorable experiences that have occurred.  

As we discuss the adversities overcome, a few parallels will be drawn to working on tough technology projects, things like keeping your head under pressure and never giving up. 

In any case it will be a departure from the typical ApacheCon session and hopefully supplying entertainment value to weary conference goers whose brains may be fried from multiple days of intense technological focus.
