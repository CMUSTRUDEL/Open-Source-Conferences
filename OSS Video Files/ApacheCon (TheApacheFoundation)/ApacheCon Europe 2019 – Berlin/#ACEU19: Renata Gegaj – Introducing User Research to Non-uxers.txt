User research is a crucial point for following a user-centered design approach. However, smaller teams may not have the resources to prioritize it.

In this session, we will cover the value of doing research, choosing the right methods. Organizing and running research in just a few steps with minimal resources, to get user feedback that will help improve your product.

These methods can be applied by designers, engineers or any team member. We will go through the process step by step, using examples from research conducted for various open source projects like GNOME, Thunderbird, I2P, Briar, HTTPS Everywhere.
Most importantly, we will discuss how to effectively use the results to have an impact on the development decision-making process.
