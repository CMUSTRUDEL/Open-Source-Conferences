Title: #ACEU19: Renata Gegaj – Introducing User Research to Non-uxers
Publication date: 2019-10-31
Playlist: ApacheCon Europe 2019 – Berlin
Description: 
	More: https://aceu19.apachecon.com/session/introducing-user-research-non-uxers-0

User research is a crucial point for following a user-centered design approach. However, smaller teams may not have the resources to prioritize it.

In this session, we will cover the value of doing research, choosing the right methods. Organizing and running research in just a few steps with minimal resources, to get user feedback that will help improve your product.

These methods can be applied by designers, engineers or any team member. We will go through the process step by step, using examples from research conducted for various open source projects like GNOME, Thunderbird, I2P, Briar, HTTPS Everywhere.
Most importantly, we will discuss how to effectively use the results to have an impact on the development decision-making process.

I Renata I am a UX researcher I work

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,950
with what I design on improving

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,740
usability of open source software I'm

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,130
also a part of an fantastic community

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,660
called

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:26,030
open source design I contribute to Nome

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:31,530
and fedora design team and I'm also a

00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:33,239
computer science student but that's

00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,120
enough about me I would like to

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:41,910
introduce you to someone else

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:45,929
this is aya this is my cousin's dog over

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:49,289
the last month I'd say she has been out

00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:55,109
of town a lot so I spent some time with

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:59,729
her and I never had a pet before so I

00:00:55,109 --> 00:01:04,320
was quite new to this and I got to learn

00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:10,409
a lot about her during the last month so

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:12,960
all the time she wanted she wanted to

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:17,549
chew my shoes she wanted to - my socks

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,909
and basically she was really frustrated

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:25,049
she was just running around all day and

00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:28,850
I also was running around trying to meet

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:32,100
her once and make her wishes come true

00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:37,530
but soon I realized that that is not the

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:42,049
way to solve this so I decided to step

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:45,000
back and observe her and I thought

00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:48,000
instead of giving her what she wants I'm

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,119
gonna see what she really needs and it

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,759
turns out that she didn't need a lot so

00:01:51,119 --> 00:02:00,420
she basically needs a warm shelter she

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:03,960
needs some good food she needs two more

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:07,259
attention for me and she mostly needed

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,860
to socialize she wanted to play with her

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:13,709
friends and after that I approached to

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,590
her in a totally different way and she

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:18,630
looks more like this now she is a

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:24,000
happier doubt

00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:27,209
so this example to me explains user

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,170
research perfectly if we look at the

00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:33,650
concept and user research it's basically

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:37,260
user research focuses on understanding

00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:39,620
user behaviors needs and motivations

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,959
through observation techniques and

00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:47,750
analyzes and feedback I'm gonna talk

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,750
about the feedback and mythology's later

00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,760
and also this code is always on a back

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,480
of my mind when I think about user

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,390
research

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,970
it's basically says design our only

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:03,660
assumptions until validated with end

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:06,120
users basically when designers and

00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,819
developers are building an interface

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,060
they do that on how they think it's the

00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:15,060
best way for the users but in the end

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:20,010
that gets proven wrong by the end users

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:23,549
most of the time so that's why we test

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:27,600
and we do research along the way so user

00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:30,720
research is kind of Connect end users

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,870
with designers and developers and kind

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,290
of translates users needs and ones that

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:45,180
we talked earlier to the designers and

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:47,940
developers so when we think of doing

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:51,600
user research and doing testings we

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:55,549
always think about a big glass wall with

00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:59,100
fancy labs with a lot of resources and

00:03:55,549 --> 00:04:03,230
equipments we think about recruiting

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:07,799
people to test with we think about

00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:11,190
needing to have UX researchers that are

00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:15,480
professionals to do this but that is not

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:19,289
always the case and it shouldn't be like

00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,860
that so there is a way that you can do

00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:27,120
user research there is a path to do that

00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:30,240
with minimal resources and I think it's

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,259
all about cutting the right corners so

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,620
for example

00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:39,490
the lab that you've seen that the class

00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:41,199
lab could just be your chair at your

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:45,669
desk at your job

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:50,100
for example or a coffee shop where you

00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:53,050
can just sit with one tester your users

00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,479
you do not need to recruit many users

00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,360
you can just call your friends or

00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:04,419
colleagues and do the testings it was

00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:09,030
some your equipment can simply be just

00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:13,780
your laptop Wi-Fi your neighbor's Wi-Fi

00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:17,260
really just whatever you have and you

00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:20,590
can do all of this and say have the same

00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:25,720
effect and impact and design just like

00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:30,130
when they do with professionals so let's

00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:32,280
start do that the first thing that we

00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:36,220
need to do is choosing the right method

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,840
so before choosing you just need to

00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:41,080
think about the problem that you have

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:45,280
and then there are many methods that you

00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:53,740
can choose from to solve your problem um

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:56,289
this is a very great method that the was

00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,620
described by Chris Christian Rohr

00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:04,210
okay I'll link the full article and the

00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:06,849
slides but he basically described more

00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:10,449
than 20 different user research methods

00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:13,750
and categorized them also there's a

00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:16,560
usability lab stubb studies ethnographic

00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:21,580
studies diary

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,770
camera studies EB testing he basically

00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:28,139
divided this on quantitative and

00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:30,400
qualitative way of doing research so

00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:33,280
quantitive is more about the numbers

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:39,940
qualitative it's about the whys of the

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:42,639
design basically I choose just some of

00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:45,710
these methods because these are the ones

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:49,190
that I mostly experience with but all

00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,000
so that are mostly used more broadly

00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,729
used

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:58,100
so there's usability testing a be

00:06:52,729 --> 00:07:02,479
testing surveys and card source card

00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:06,350
sorting is a great way for organizing

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:10,490
information infrastructure so it's

00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:14,600
basically helps you discover your users

00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:16,789
mental models so it helps them it helps

00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:20,060
you to understand how they really think

00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:24,199
and how they organize their topics and

00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:28,300
their ideas the way you do this you can

00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:31,729
do this remotely there are so many great

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:35,300
softwares that help you do this

00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:38,410
but the best way is to do it in person

00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:41,060
so it could be a one in one sessions or

00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:45,610
you testing with a group of people

00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:49,090
basically you give them some cards with

00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:52,520
the information for from your software

00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:54,199
that you want to organize for example a

00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,349
website or whatever that is

00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:59,840
and then see how they you organize them

00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:04,130
and ask them always to think out loud

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:06,470
and to tell you why are they grouping

00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:11,090
these things together because that helps

00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:15,139
you understand them better you can do

00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:18,770
this mostly in the beginning when you

00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:22,130
want to redesign a whole software or

00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:24,650
when you're just starting out to do the

00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:29,210
design this helps you mostly in the

00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:32,510
beginning there's always there's also

00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:35,270
surveys and interviews this is a great

00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:37,039
way to get to know your audience so for

00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:41,690
example you do this in the beginning

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:44,360
before starting the product you get to

00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:47,209
know all the users basically so you do

00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,790
surveys online this is a very also very

00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:52,880
cheap way to get to know the users so

00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:54,950
you do a survey online you send it out

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,829
to a lot of people that you target and

00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:59,450
you think are going to use that server

00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:01,580
and just ask them

00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,750
about the whole product and what they

00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,450
think

00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:09,800
interviews are similar but even better

00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:12,710
because you get to talk in person with

00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,840
each user so you get to ask a lot of

00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:17,660
specific questions that you can't

00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:20,750
achieve with surveys so say surveys are

00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:22,700
more static so basically you have some

00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:25,040
questions that they answer but with

00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:28,430
interviews you get to talk to each of

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,560
them and besides the surveys questions

00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:33,860
you can just deviate and ask one more

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,300
about what they think on a specific

00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:41,450
thing that you are more interested to

00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:44,810
know there's also usability testing this

00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:50,900
is the most common way to test the

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:54,070
applications usability so how do we do

00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:57,080
this the first step is to choose

00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:59,960
personas basically your target audience

00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:02,420
who is more likely to use your product

00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:05,420
if you are building a software that is

00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:08,960
it has a general purpose let's say like

00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:11,450
a calendar you want to include as much

00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:15,380
diverse group of people as possible

00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:17,480
if you are testing an application that

00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:23,570
it's a software that is more specific

00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:26,390
for example or gif for example is

00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:29,450
just for designer so you want to include

00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:32,140
beginner designers designers who have

00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:35,690
used alternatives of game before and

00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:38,930
don't know how to really use it so you

00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:44,090
can just collect a specific target which

00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:47,120
is designers after that you want to

00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:50,270
decide how many testers you are going to

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,270
include so for example I in most cases

00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:56,240
I've found out that 5 testers it's

00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:59,930
enough to uncover most usability

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,180
problems because if you do that less

00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:04,070
than that

00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:09,790
you won't get all the problems that

00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:13,730
usability has if you do more than 5 then

00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:18,379
sometimes problems get just repeatedly

00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:21,259
the same so you won't find out more you

00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:27,109
just can't keep repeating the same

00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:30,859
problems after deciding your users your

00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:34,209
target users you go ahead and create

00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:38,769
some scenario tasks or just ask

00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:42,889
that's or tasks are basically short

00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:46,459
stories or where you tell each dancers

00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:49,399
what are they going to do and how are

00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:54,799
they going to use your software so for

00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:57,709
example if you want to you can say can

00:11:54,799 --> 00:12:03,259
you just find this specific feature for

00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:06,199
me how many tasks it depends on the size

00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:10,249
of the testing that you organize so for

00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:12,559
example I think again five to ten tasks

00:12:10,249 --> 00:12:14,720
are more than enough because more than

00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,899
that the users can get a little bit

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:26,629
bored during the session and the session

00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:29,389
might be really long after that we do

00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:31,879
the actual testing so the tools with

00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:37,089
that we need for testing or basically or

00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:40,339
a laptop or mobile or depends on what

00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:42,649
software are you testing before the test

00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:46,100
you should print all their tasks and

00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:48,199
give them to the user and just get

00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,449
familiar with them ask them like about

00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:53,179
them who they are and it's very

00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:55,819
important to explain to them that the

00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:58,220
testing it's not about them it's about

00:12:55,819 --> 00:13:00,619
the software because they can really get

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,419
uncomfortable and think that the when

00:13:00,619 --> 00:13:04,669
they are not doing a good job is their

00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:07,369
fault but just make it clear to them

00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:09,799
that if they are not doing a good job

00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:12,049
it's the software's fault just blame it

00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:17,480
on the software and as a self wears

00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:21,470
usability um after that starts a testing

00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,989
process so you when the testing process

00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:27,050
starts you do not have to in to

00:13:23,989 --> 00:13:29,779
interrupt the user so just let them

00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:32,360
do the tasks and do not interrupt them

00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:35,870
because that might confuse them wait

00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,970
until the test ends and prepare all the

00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:40,040
questions that you have in mind just

00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:43,850
write them somewhere in your notes and

00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,740
ask them after the session it's done so

00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:48,890
after the test you do the follow-up

00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:51,050
questions like for example you seemed

00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:53,750
really frustrated here what were you

00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:56,029
thinking and how would you do this

00:13:53,750 --> 00:14:00,440
differently or whatever questions you

00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:02,540
had in mind doing the testing and that's

00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,540
basically it about usability testing

00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:08,930
another great way to do user research is

00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:12,339
a be testing a be testing it's basically

00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:15,740
what the name says it's comparing a

00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:18,220
version a of a software with a version P

00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:21,529
of the software and choosing the users

00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:26,779
actually most of the times randomly so

00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:30,490
you present each each case case a and

00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:33,380
Callie's B and see how they reacted so

00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:37,100
this is more of a quantitative approach

00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:40,100
to do user research so with a be testing

00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,560
you get more numbers on how much people

00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:45,200
do this and how much people do that but

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,959
with usability testing you get the

00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,540
qualitative part so you get the whys why

00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:54,500
did the user react like this so - in

00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:56,480
order to do a great user research mostly

00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:59,810
you should combine all of these methods

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,390
so do not use just a be testing or just

00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:03,079
usability testing and say that that is

00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:05,540
okay

00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:08,420
you should combine as much methods as

00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:15,410
you can to get different approaches and

00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:17,660
different opinions after you do all of

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:20,750
these testings no matter which method

00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:25,100
you chose the very important part is to

00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:28,160
do the analyzes and to do the results

00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:31,190
basically to tell other people what you

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,670
have learned during these testings and

00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:36,949
research that you have done you can do

00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:40,380
this in a lot of ways

00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:43,590
you can just write a formal paper like

00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:46,710
fifteen to twenty pages and where you

00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:49,230
explain everything by words but also by

00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:52,650
screenshots and telling exactly where

00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:55,230
the problems were if you don't have the

00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:58,980
time for that you can also do a last

00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:01,820
formal paper just explaining quickly

00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:05,010
everything you can do live presentations

00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,600
if that so you should talk to the team

00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,460
that you're working with if they are

00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,890
more comfortable with listening to

00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:13,380
presentations and do that if they need

00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:16,680
to read everything then do the papers

00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:19,380
you can also do bug trackers so this

00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:22,500
happens a lot on open source software

00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:24,600
where you just file bug and then explain

00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,630
everything there this can be really

00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:35,190
messy because the comments can just get

00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:38,310
nested but that's also a way so during

00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:40,650
the when you are presenting so the

00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:43,080
things that you've learned just be

00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:45,480
mindful of the visualizations these are

00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,630
the great tools that you can use so for

00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,570
example just take screenshots that

00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:54,270
you've done during the testings

00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:56,970
highlight the part that you think was

00:16:54,270 --> 00:17:02,250
more difficult to use and this way

00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:04,020
whoever is reading your test has easier

00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,420
time understanding what you meant

00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:08,400
because by words sometimes people get

00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:12,089
confused and when they see it visually

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:16,260
it can help them a lot also use tables

00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:21,930
or charts to explain more about the

00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:25,170
users or software another great tool a

00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:29,130
visual tool too that you can use it or

00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:32,280
heat maps heat maps are basically here

00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:34,260
on one side you list off the tasks that

00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,770
you give to the user on the other side

00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:41,100
you have some boxes with colors to rate

00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:43,890
how easy or hard was for the user to

00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:46,380
accomplish the tasks for example the

00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:49,650
green ones are the ones that the user

00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:53,230
had really easy time figuring out the

00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:56,590
yellow ones all the ones were using

00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:58,000
were a little bit confused but still

00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:00,880
figuring it out

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,120
the red ones are where they spend a lot

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,580
of time thinking about that so extended

00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:09,519
amount of time and the black months or

00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:11,669
when they just give up and they say I

00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:14,350
can't do this task

00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:17,950
just be careful we're not you are doing

00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:20,860
the testings even if you see that

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:23,740
something is really easy to to do or a

00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:26,740
button is there just do not lead them or

00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:32,279
do not give them help before the testing

00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:35,679
finishes so these are just some examples

00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:38,649
that I've worked on during the last year

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:42,250
of use of researches so you can see it

00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:46,299
in action how helpful it can be so this

00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:49,779
is HTTPS Everywhere the before part was

00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:53,559
basically links and checkboxes not very

00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:56,289
user-friendly you don't need to watch a

00:18:53,559 --> 00:19:00,010
tutorial to understand how this works

00:18:56,289 --> 00:19:01,750
you should be able to figure it out just

00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:04,840
by the software itself just by the

00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:07,179
interface so this is after user research

00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:13,230
this is after the testing that we've

00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:15,610
done and it looks much more easy to use

00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:18,460
this is Thunderbird preferences

00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:23,110
redesigned so this is how it was and now

00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:25,870
and this is Breyer so this was a

00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:28,570
completely new feature the first

00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:31,720
prototype didn't actually do well in

00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:34,389
usability testing so we decided to make

00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:38,860
two screens it was plated in two parts

00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:40,960
and right now this is better but it's

00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:44,559
not there so we are testing again and

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,809
seeing how this goes yeah

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,990
so this is it thank you everyone again

00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:52,570
for coming if you have any questions or

00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:55,360
want to talk to me I will be here or

00:19:52,570 --> 00:20:00,690
just find me at that I know a guy my

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,690
handle almost everywhere yeah thank you

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:10,440
I don't know if we have time for any

00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:17,479
questions oh I'll just try so if there

00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:17,479
is anyone want to ask something okay

00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:40,289
yeah how do you talk about the

00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:42,139
importance of user testing to to get

00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:45,029
other people to buy buy off on it

00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:50,309
because it does take time and energy to

00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:52,619
do it so how do you convince well I

00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:56,549
think this right now it's a part of the

00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:59,729
convincing part so huge has go out and

00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:02,549
tell people instead of how hard it is to

00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:06,299
do that I just decide to tell them how

00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:08,609
easy it can be to do that and that's the

00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:13,109
one part and the other part is showing

00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:15,359
real examples on how impactful that is

00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:19,289
and I think that's the best way in the

00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:21,899
easiest wait for them to decide that hey

00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:33,390
this is this is amazing and we should do

00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:39,819
this so buy real examples okay thank you

00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:39,819
