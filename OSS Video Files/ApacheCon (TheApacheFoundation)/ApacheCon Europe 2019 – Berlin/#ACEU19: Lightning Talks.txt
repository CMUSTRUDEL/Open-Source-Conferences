	00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,860
so yes I'm Shane it's roman we're here

00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:10,510
to moderate the lightning talks and what

00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,639
are the Lightning talks especially this

00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,469
time I know it's very very complicated

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,090
so let me actually get you through the

00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:17,410
set of rules there's about ten of them

00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,820
and I think you know we need to start

00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,050
from the beginning right yeah and of

00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,759
course we start with zero because we're

00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,040
a program or something exactly

00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:26,410
so rule number zero you have to get on

00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,899
stage rule number one you have to get

00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,980
off stage in how many it's less than

00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:31,000
four minutes because we don't want to

00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,220
get between you and your coffee

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,170
exactly rule number three you have to

00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,210
talk about something that is relevant to

00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,830
the Apache Software Foundation or one of

00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,050
our communities or something that is

00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:43,240
relevant to you but this still might be

00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:46,300
enjoyable by the rest of the attendees

00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,610
that this this is a lot of rules we need

00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,710
some special cases oh you know I I'm I'm

00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,850
just getting started yeah I think people

00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,070
are gonna want their coffee I think we

00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,630
need to have more of an example do you

00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,550
have a good example in my yeah so I'm

00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:59,110
gonna I'm gonna just change this is you

00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,760
know we do this at fat you sometimes I'm

00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,900
just gonna change the agenda and I'm

00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,329
gonna give it the first lightning talk

00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,549
as an example to show you how quick we

00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:07,869
can go through these with one idea one

00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:09,580
great idea what want to get across so

00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:11,140
okay that sounds good to me

00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,650
you wanna start timeing you've got

00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:17,770
exactly four minutes okay wait so hey

00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:25,720
Roman knock knock who's there

00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:28,000
AK ak who gesundheit okay what that's

00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,920
the perfect reaction for a dad joke so

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,600
but it got across the point we're a

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,430
little bit of humor in the morning did

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,710
you get deep is going and you know

00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:37,450
something simple to think about good

00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:42,040
health so good as to you good health to

00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:43,840
everyone so what else well I think

00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,850
that's about it in terms of the

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,710
Lightning talks it's time we do allow

00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:50,409
normally we don't allow slides but we do

00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:51,430
a lot of slides this time and I think we

00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:54,400
should actually go on to the first

00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:56,200
speaker before item so I actually have a

00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,790
question for you so how is your digital

00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,310
footprint doing Shane do you have a

00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:03,490
digital footprint um you know I've

00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:06,070
thought about this and no I keep purely

00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:09,039
analog footprint so I have no digital

00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:10,330
footprint okay no batteries in here I on

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,620
the other hand that's a recovering black

00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,180
hat you used to have a lot of the

00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,010
digital footprint in some of the

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,450
unsavory places so I do care about mid

00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,510
digital footprint and in fact I actually

00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,790
care about your did

00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,340
footprint as well and that's why our

00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:25,069
first speaker Dirk who will be talking

00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:28,909
about wax that is hot

00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:32,959
I think and how to protect our public

00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:36,829
and private digital spaces so let me

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:41,440
welcome Dirk on stage do have an extra

00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:44,150
mic for him okay the timer as well I

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,549
will keep time you're very people timer

00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,439
alright okay so really while I talk what

00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:50,209
I want to talk about is red wax sort of

00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:54,019
like the so like sealing wax you solve

00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:55,310
like use and and really solve like well

00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:57,319
this is about it took like actually read

00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,180
walks Redbox dot-eu is actually so of

00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:00,739
like an open source project Graham

00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,230
lacketh and I hope like I've started a

00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:05,150
few years ago and but I don't want to

00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,310
talk directly about technology in that

00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,409
and it is about trust it's about

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,859
security it is but by look like why

00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:14,629
trust we can verify about transparency

00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:18,099
but really what it is about is about

00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:20,269
this problem we have in technology that

00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:22,250
very often stuff like when we build

00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:23,720
systems we built architecture like for

00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,269
example the examples we saw today in the

00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,709
cities in Kenya and so on there's a

00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:31,669
tendency that our architecture our

00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:33,919
technology that it follows somehow the

00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:35,060
organization the politics the world in

00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,799
which we live

00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,269
so our architecture is not some soft

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,889
like beautiful thing we've constructed

00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:41,989
the actually so glad usually the

00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:43,819
organization is reflected in it the

00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:46,069
powers around us are reflected in our

00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:47,810
technology the politics is reflected in

00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:49,370
it the graph the corruption all these

00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,840
sort of problems of like reappear on our

00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,790
architecture because very often so like

00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,500
we saw I don't really have a free hand

00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,720
to solve like build these things and

00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,099
they're simply solved like they solve

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,199
like common to existing in that world

00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:01,459
and very often solve like you would like

00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,930
to solve like sometimes turn those

00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:04,459
things around because the opposite is

00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,069
also true if certain so like

00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:08,989
architecture certain technologies only

00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:10,549
allow ID cards for example to be solved

00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:11,930
like issue with fingerprints or not with

00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:14,329
fingerprints and some people have those

00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,859
worn off then also that technology

00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:17,329
starts to influence so like the

00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:20,150
organization that can carry these things

00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,260
the structures it can make so basically

00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,030
what we're trying to do with rhetoric

00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,030
look like break through a lot of that

00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,800
and obviously with technologies who were

00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,060
searching for technical places where we

00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,069
can solve that and one of the things

00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,360
we've noticed over the years is that

00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:37,369
around security safety privacy trust and

00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,680
there is a tendency that our solution so

00:04:37,369 --> 00:04:41,779
of like impose things on the world we

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,669
got big centralized certificate

00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:46,189
authorities we get all sorts of things

00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:47,569
which look like are very lumpy and it's

00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:49,819
off like start to determine how we do

00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:51,559
things we have like a wonderful code

00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:52,669
bases like open SSL but if you sort of

00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:55,460
like looking at the cover it's

00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:56,960
absolutely enormous and if you saw like

00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,159
see look at the way we supply configure

00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,990
that like if you for example even take

00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:01,069
something as old and age and then crafty

00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,680
as the Apache web server

00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:05,029
I mean configuring a Zelan that is

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,949
actually sort of like a complex things

00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:08,509
we solve like many lines and statements

00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:09,229
and different rules and cryptography

00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:11,509
things and so on

00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:13,309
so what we're trying to do in red box is

00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:15,770
actually break all that up in very very

00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:18,020
small pieces and actually give each of

00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:19,999
those pieces off like a good common

00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,860
industry good practice sort of like way

00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,999
of doing it so it actually only one way

00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,770
of doing it and so like what is

00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:26,149
considered good industry practice and we

00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,639
can so block keep that on as so fly

00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:31,039
extenders mature quite easily so rather

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,569
than solve like when you choose to do

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,610
certain things of like be forced to

00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:36,379
adapt your architecture you show like

00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,610
thing to basically that that environment

00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:38,959
you're in use of like have soap like

00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,839
much smaller building blocks you so

00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,969
black play with freely to sign things to

00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,800
for example bring out timestamp and put

00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:47,539
a little signature on that to encrypt a

00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,990
small thing to so it basically preserve

00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:53,389
little bit of privacy and so like our

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,069
hopes of like is that as we saw like put

00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:57,199
like free web soft like of having these

00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:59,360
very very small parts in there we select

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,479
start to claw back some of these so like

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,159
very big systems were so like the the

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,990
world they've shaped in the world that

00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:07,490
shapes and so that can be broken up a

00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,889
little bit then we get like smaller bit

00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:12,949
so we can start to solve I could rebuild

00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:14,209
newer smaller things at a smaller scale

00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:16,189
and basically solve like bring that

00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:17,809
public digital space so like closer

00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:19,909
again stuff like to a sort of like to

00:06:17,809 --> 00:06:21,349
build it the way we want to do it so if

00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:23,300
you're interested if you're curious go

00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:25,219
to read walk study you so black for

00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,559
solve the very first source code to be

00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:29,029
there and expects of like to see me

00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:30,499
talking about is in the years coming

00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:32,029
because it's something very very dear to

00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:33,979
my heart to solve like reclaim that

00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:37,669
digital space to make it a personal

00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:41,569
thing again thank you thank you so much

00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:46,580
Thanks that by the way was impressively

00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:47,930
on time yes yes thank you Dirk thank you

00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,879
for getting us all closer to coffee and

00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,740
keeping us and that's a perfect segue

00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:54,319
from the earlier talks that I hadn't

00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,120
even realized how close that was and so

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,039
we have another speaker coming up I have

00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,580
a little bit of a problem with the next

00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:04,909
talk attribute yeah towards an attribute

00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,319
based role based access control so role

00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:08,779
based I don't understand this it's a

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,610
mouthful I mean what is it about even

00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:13,669
yeah and it and and if you're if you're

00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:15,919
basing your access to roles when are we

00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:18,439
gonna start basing access to bread you

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,210
know crackers I know I'm having a hard

00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:22,310
time with this one but let's have Shawn

00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:26,210
come up and can we get the slides from

00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:30,589
the from the website besides from the

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:32,300
pivot this here we have slides talk

00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:35,870
about the Shawn McKinney role based

00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,439
access control systems yeah and the time

00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:48,969
starts now

00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:52,550
not those kind of roles Shane's okay so

00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:55,699
as we said towards an attribute based

00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:59,449
rule based access control system so I'm

00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:02,539
an our back guy I really like the

00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:06,439
specification it's very useful a lot of

00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:09,259
people use it it's concise it's elegant

00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:12,339
it describes the shape of the data it

00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:15,379
describes the shape of them of the api's

00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:17,779
but there's a really big problem with it

00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:20,960
and that's a problem of context which is

00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:23,870
as soon as you put context into the

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,379
decision we get this sort of explosion

00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:29,360
of roles so what do I mean by that so

00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:32,449
let's take an example so we have a few

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,329
roles here and we have a bit of context

00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:37,969
which would be the customer right there

00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:40,089
and so as soon as you try to add say you

00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:43,550
want to say well I want to give Bob

00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:46,010
access to that page or that role number

00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:48,740
one but only when he's acting on behalf

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,660
of customer four five six then you run

00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,490
into this explosion of roles and it's

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:55,450
actually

00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:57,160
a linear increase so you end up with the

00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:00,190
number of rolls which is the number of

00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:02,110
rolls times the number of values of

00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,820
context so if you have three customers

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,950
that's fine you only have nine rolls but

00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:08,800
what if you have a thousand customers

00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:10,120
and you end up with three thousand rolls

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,790
what if it's a hundred thousand

00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,490
customers you have you know even more so

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,560
what do we do about that well a lot of

00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:21,280
people would point you to attribute

00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,780
based access control and tell you to use

00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,380
that instead role based access control

00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:28,120
is dead don't use it and it's actually a

00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:32,770
pretty interesting idea

00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:36,460
attributes are it allows you to in that

00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:39,190
kind of context a Aroldis becomes

00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:41,140
another attribute and so you can assign

00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,000
these attributes directly to the subject

00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,420
and you can do your accent your policies

00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,530
based on that and it's kind of nice

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,540
except there's a bit of a problem with

00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:52,030
that and that's a problem of complexity

00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:54,790
so a typical attribute based access

00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:58,300
control system is quite hard to

00:09:54,790 --> 00:10:00,520
implement it's not readily available via

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:03,280
say an open source provider you can't

00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:05,530
really find them out here if there's not

00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,660
an a back system and Apache right now

00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,920
and so what do you do you got to pay

00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,560
somebody a lot of money to implement

00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,720
which is quite a large barrier for small

00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,870
companies and small governments and they

00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,240
can't do it so I'm proposing a solution

00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,890
which is to say let's keep our back but

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,720
let's sprinkle a bit of attributes into

00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:26,260
the decision how do we do that

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,940
so it's in in our in role based access

00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,090
control you have let's call it a role

00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:32,890
activation phase where just because that

00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:34,600
role is a sign doesn't necessarily mean

00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:37,150
that that role is going to be activated

00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,750
in the session so what does that do for

00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:42,730
us well let's take an example we've got

00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,380
here a couple roles we got a teller and

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:46,930
we got a coin washer and we're going to

00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:51,130
introduce a bit of context in this case

00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:52,990
which is location so we got a few users

00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:55,420
we're gonna say yeah currently he's a

00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:56,980
coin washer in the north and he's a coin

00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:00,350
washer in the south but he's a teller

00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:03,650
only in the east and

00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:06,770
no mo is a teller in the north and south

00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:08,450
and so on so forth and so that means

00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:10,370
that the rule becomes kind of special

00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:12,200
that the access control policy engine

00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:15,140
has to identify that role during the

00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,700
activation phase and say whoa I need to

00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:19,160
look at this context I can't just

00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,810
automatically activate it and it also

00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:24,200
means that you have to store that bit of

00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:25,940
context on the user entry as well so no

00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,130
problem we have this I got the

00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,770
screenshot from this Apache fortress

00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:33,770
solution you can see we have curly and

00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:35,450
he has say for example he's a teller in

00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:37,130
the east and he's a washer in the north

00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:41,450
and the south great so what does the

00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:50,390
code look like here you can see that

00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:54,800
I've run out of time so I'm going to try

00:11:50,390 --> 00:12:00,110
to stop that it still counts as time you

00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:02,270
know that's right so just real quick at

00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:05,090
run time when you're establishing the

00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:07,910
session you would push the context in to

00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:10,040
the runtime and so in this case we have

00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:12,410
we're saying we're in the location north

00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:17,150
so in that case curly would just

00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:20,450
activate as a washer and so it's all

00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:22,220
quite easy and we actually have that in

00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,530
Apache fortress if you're interested

00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,210
check out that project which is a role

00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:28,550
based access control system or you can

00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:31,310
check out these examples or come talk to

00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:35,780
me thank you awesome thank you so much

00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:36,920
make sure on well I've got to say now I

00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,470
actually understand it better

00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:42,190
so I guess lightning talks help yes they

00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:44,870
certainly do and I'm also getting hungry

00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,970
mmm I have a question for you though you

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:48,500
look like a very fashionable guy you

00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:51,500
know just well I think like just thank

00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,510
you look at Rainn raise I okay and

00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,000
what's the question is do you actually

00:12:53,510 --> 00:13:00,470
have the same sense of fashion in your

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,230
socks no I do not I do and that's why

00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:05,660
the speaker gift was just such a

00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:07,520
heartwarming gift for me but our next

00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,400
lighting talk will be talking about how

00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,930
can we get shirts socks or anything that

00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:16,620
swag for Apache

00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:17,490
objects so Apache schwag can we get you

00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,520
on stage

00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:23,399
mark mark is marking the audience yes

00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:27,420
market in the marks and here he even has

00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:29,610
a slide excellent thank you

00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,350
for those of you who aren't aware the

00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,360
community development project

00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:36,120
essentially provides a service for any

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,880
project that wants it to set up a swag

00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,709
store on RedBubble calm so if your

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,890
project wants to be able to buy your

00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:46,980
project logo on shower curtains clocks

00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:50,010
or even t-shirts then drop us an email

00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:52,500
at dev at community dot Apache dot org

00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:57,120
and we will get your project set up on

00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:59,760
reparable thank you very much Wow Wow

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,520
that was a like the quickest and most

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,050
affecting effect affecting lightening

00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,600
talk I've ever seen

00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:08,490
do we have anything else yes we do we

00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,230
have one we're talking about industrial

00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:12,810
IOT which I'm actually kind of excited

00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:15,120
about oh that makes two of us I mean IOT

00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,620
is getting to be a big thing and you

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,760
know but all the devices are kind of

00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,230
they're little just little chips on

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,300
boards like industrial to you so like

00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:26,010
it's gonna be like transformers alright

00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:29,310
the sensors or something like the Julian

00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:33,589
we need to find his slides here talking

00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:33,589
about industrial IOT at Apache yeah

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:48,740
let's see this one should be oh yes

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,740
excellent

00:14:51,930 --> 00:15:00,550
this shirt so hello thank you very much

00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:03,100
I the title of my talk is in natural IOT

00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:05,890
at Apache so I want to give you a very

00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:08,050
quick overview and what kind of projects

00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:12,190
we have into this industrial IOT area

00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:15,820
what I mean by that and also try to give

00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:19,230
you a short distinguishing between the

00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:21,190
Eclipse Foundation how they do it so

00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:23,530
let's end up with something which is

00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:25,870
probably unusual for someone standing on

00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:27,280
the keynote stage and saying that

00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,640
there's something he likes better about

00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:34,600
the clips foundation in the ASF surfer

00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:36,220
data they have just concept of their sub

00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,350
communities I don't know how they call

00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,210
it exactly but they're especially in IOT

00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:44,320
area they are very active to have about

00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:46,270
40 40 projects in the IOT area for Gabe

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,620
is cloud puffs of all that kind of stuff

00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:52,090
but this is mostly custom I a team and

00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:56,110
to save some time and go to the cool

00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:58,240
cool devices Roman and Shane wished I

00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:00,910
want to show you what we mean with

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,220
industrial tee those are the real things

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:05,710
so this is the ended of real things we

00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,900
have the machines that weighed tons this

00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:12,070
machine on the left point where weights

00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:13,690
50 tons probably and by using Apache PLC

00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,220
Forex we're able to communicate with the

00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,460
machine we could even control the

00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:20,920
machine but this is seriously dangerous

00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:23,140
but we get data out of it and can

00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,570
analyze whatever it does and this is of

00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:27,850
course way cooler than Smart Watch or

00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:31,870
something because well it's a real

00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:36,490
machine it's loud and heavy and probably

00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:39,730
also bit smelly so to to kind of point

00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:43,090
up here are three projects two of them

00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:45,460
incubating to give you a short overview

00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:47,560
about this small industrial IT community

00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,420
we have so we have POC Forex basically

00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,070
we used to fetched it out of this

00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:54,730
machine communicate with this kind of

00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:57,250
machines with their native protocols we

00:16:54,730 --> 00:17:00,850
have a batch reaction which is for data

00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:03,250
processing data routing and we have IOT

00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:04,900
DB which is the new hot to store

00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,540
the time series data we get out of there

00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:10,600
machines thousands of measurements each

00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:14,170
second and because we like this concept

00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:16,600
of this IOT subgroup we made a proposal

00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:19,650
to get a mailing list which is not for a

00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:23,920
project but the ASF white mailing list

00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:25,750
which is IOT at Apache that org and as

00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,900
my last lightning talk in Las Vegas let

00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:31,390
me close this up with two words you want

00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,940
to subscribe to

00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:36,010
IIT at Apache dork so thank you very

00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:39,400
much and hope to see your list thank you

00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:41,200
so much that is awesome

00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,660
okay I've got a question for our

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,140
audience do you guys want to hear one

00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:49,150
more lightning talk awesome so I think

00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,340
we've got one more I think we actually

00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:56,340
should go for towards coffee because no

00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:58,840
hands but the no but the audience the

00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:02,110
community over lunch I mean that's the

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,060
Apache roll okay okay so let me let me

00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,380
introduce the next lightning talk and I

00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,610
think you know this speaker is somewhere

00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,280
in the audience but I will give you

00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:11,620
three clues to guess who that is so that

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,590
person is about to turn 20 years at

00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:17,170
Apache today tomorrow in a few days can

00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:19,390
you can you guess what that is no this

00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:20,860
is a surprise guest to me okay I'm

00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,600
trying to open their slides that I can

00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:26,230
see here but I'm having a hard time and

00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:29,410
person as far as I remember has a lot of

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:32,110
ideas about you know how to organize

00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:35,530
Apache communities and might even run a

00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:38,290
website explaining this idea of an

00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:41,860
Apache way or something still maybe

00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:45,550
somebody from DoD okay doesn't ring the

00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:48,040
bell okay final clue before before we

00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:51,270
invite the speaker on stage I think this

00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:53,920
speaker has an enormous love for cats

00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:55,480
still doesn't really I mean there a lot

00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,160
of us who love cats that's about half of

00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,490
why the internet was invented wasn't it

00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:03,700
okay my final clue a really good fashion

00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:05,920
sense oh okay I know I know

00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:13,120
so let me introduce to you our last

00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:14,890
speaker today that's like so it is

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,300
awesome shirt but it is you Shane so

00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:18,520
could we get the slides background for

00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,350
the machine please

00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,760
the last coat so I will do a an

00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,900
abbreviated version of my lightning talk

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,740
and I'll talk like the FedEx announcer

00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,050
and go really really fast

00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,110
okay sorry little bit too fast five

00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:31,000
things you might not know about Apache

00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:34,060
so does Apache have a URL shortening

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,210
service why yes we do we have our very

00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:39,310
own it's called s dot Apache org if you

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,350
are committer you can shorten your URLs

00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:43,920
using our service which is the website

00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:47,410
up here why is that important because

00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:50,710
who knows how long bitly for example

00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:55,390
will be around because dot ly is the

00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:57,310
domain name for Libya Apache org will be

00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:58,930
around for the next 50 years and we will

00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:04,030
guarantee that your URLs will stay

00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:05,860
shortened number one what is a PMC it's

00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,570
a project management committee so they

00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:09,670
are the people who vote on releases and

00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:12,670
the other people who vote to add new

00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:14,980
committers to projects that's really the

00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,810
the base thing they're also a formal

00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:19,390
part of the ASF and they're sort of how

00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:21,340
we have our legal shield protecting

00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:23,440
people when we make releases and again

00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,970
of course as you can see here asked on

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,940
Apache at org i'll i'll post these four

00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:31,270
sites slides online esta pachi org slash

00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:34,840
about - PMC and you will find the answer

00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:37,090
to this question so number two how do I

00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,760
become an Apache member or get a seat on

00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:43,510
the board now we don't always get seats

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,850
okay but still there's no one answer

00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:47,530
this is a big question really it's used

00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:49,990
the apache way to serve the public good

00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:53,710
that's why we're here to give away our

00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:56,740
software to help people and membership

00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,360
in the foundation itself is recognizing

00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,430
if you people who are working on

00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,920
multiple projects who are doing a bigger

00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:04,120
thing than simply the one thing they're

00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:08,440
doing maybe with their day job or the

00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:11,230
code and importantly apache governance

00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,540
is always independent so unlike some

00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:16,810
other foundations which do excellent

00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:18,820
work we always have purely independent

00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,710
directors there is no way that a company

00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,570
could buy a seat or otherwise influence

00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:25,210
the board and apache we're just we're

00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:26,650
built to defend against that so we have

00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:29,380
an excellent essay here at about

00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:31,000
independence numbers really what well

00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,350
what is an apache member i've just been

00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,700
talking about that

00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:36,970
it's probably not really what you think

00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:39,039
if you're a committer thank you we love

00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:40,509
all the code you're contributing being a

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,509
member is kind of like being a committer

00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:46,809
to the legal corporation behind the

00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:48,220
scenes and it's mostly the annual

00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:50,440
meeting we have an annual meeting where

00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,750
we have a shareholder meeting we vote on

00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,240
the board and and go through an agenda

00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,799
that's very old-fashioned so that's not

00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,299
very interesting what is interesting is

00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,429
members have visibility into all

00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:02,169
projects so well members can't

00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:04,360
contribute to a project necessarily

00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:08,139
unless they are creator there they can

00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:10,629
discuss things with any project so how

00:22:08,139 --> 00:22:13,210
can I be successful at Apache this is

00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:14,860
something we can't if we gave 10 talks

00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:18,039
we couldn't help everybody with because

00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,940
everybody has their own story so there

00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:21,610
are a number of people who've written

00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:24,250
some great success at Apache their own

00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:26,799
story how they got here which is at this

00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:30,820
link and is also on the blog at Apache

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:32,950
orc website and number five which I find

00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:36,039
popular how do I get in for things for

00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:39,190
my project like you want yeah another

00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:42,129
JIRA you want more CI cap capacity well

00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:45,159
you have to ask for them and it's a tip

00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:48,519
ask politely and the Enver team really

00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:50,730
likes ponies and and gnomes are bad

00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:55,000
gnomes are the people who break things

00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:57,519
so and number six is how do I get Shane

00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,200
off stage because I'm up here I'm having

00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:01,570
a great time right I think I'm being

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:05,799
well not as funny as I usually am but

00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:07,259
not too bad I think let's toss about yes

00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:09,789
kids my two cats

00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:13,330
pÃ¡linka and tokay we have more cats at

00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:15,100
home but these are the most photogenic

00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:23,679
ones blinka and toki named after

00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:25,629
Hungarian liquors all right thank you so

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,170
much that's all we've got

00:23:25,629 --> 00:23:31,660
all right thank you

00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:31,660
