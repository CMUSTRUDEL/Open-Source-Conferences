	00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,080
these are the presentations about apache

00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,319
royale

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,080
that we did at the apache software

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:12,320
foundation virtual convention in 2020

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,400
we start with a high level view of what

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,440
royale is where it came from

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,840
what it does and what it can do for you

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,840
then we have a presentation that shows

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,840
how to start from a completely blank

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,359
file to create something even if you

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,800
have never worked with

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:32,079
royale or its predecessor flex

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,640
we also show how to migrate an existing

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,680
flex

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,320
application to royale

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,239
there are thousands of such applications

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,520
which are very powerful but are coming

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,520
toward end of life

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,120
because the flash player that they

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,160
depend on

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,559
is going away we show how to move you

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,160
over

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,640
from flex to royale

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,520
and finally we do a little tour of a

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,079
collection

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,920
of components in royale that you may

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,520
find very useful in building your

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,040
application we call them

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,560
toured jewel there's so much more to

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,880
learn about royale

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,280
and if you want to do that come on over

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,799

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,960
