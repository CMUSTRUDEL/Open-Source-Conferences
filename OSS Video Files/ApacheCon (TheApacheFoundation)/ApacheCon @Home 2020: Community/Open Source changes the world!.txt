	Open Source changes the world!

In a world that's increasingly digital, Open Source software is everywhere: in your phone, your elevator, your car, behind your bank account...more than ever, Open Source is at the heart of our world. Beyond these very concrete contributions to our society's well being, Open Source communities have also helped design innovative collaboration techniques, especially around remote and distributed work. Often running without a formal boss and without a formal schedule, Open Source communities consistently produce software that's of great quality, sometimes world-changing. COVID-19 has prompted many companies and organizations to speed up their transition to digital transformation and distributed collaboration. This talk will show what Open Source communities can bring to this new world, based on a number of concrete example where simple tools and techniques make all the difference in terms of digital and remote collaboration.

Bertrand Delacretaz works as a Principal Scientist for Adobe in Basel, Switzerland. He's involved in software design and development for Adobe Experience Cloud products, which use many open source modules, mostly from Apache projects to which his teams contribute extensively. Bertrand is currently (2020-2021) on his eleventh term as a member of the Apache Software Foundation's Board of Directors and has been active in the Foundation for about 20 years.
