	Serve, Lead, Succeed the Open (mindful) Way to Prevent/Reverse Burnout in Boardrooms
Prashant V. Joshi

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

Open Source SW (OSS) community has been brilliant in bringing the leadership out of everyone to innovate, contribute and transform. Covid-19, has brought one more challenge to the OSS community.This unique experiential talk inspires and opens minds of new and seasoned OSS community members at large to become successful servant-leaders through self-care coping mechanisms to prevent and alleviate burnout in boardrooms, classrooms and home-rooms in the midst of this pandemic and beyond. Yes you can! === Description: This talk engages the audience with simple, practical, scientific, rational and original ideas. It uses open and mindfulness principles so that every mind opens up (body too!), and gets inspired towards self-transformation. Whether you are a seasoned OSS guru or a novice/curious aspirant, this talk is for you. Why? A closed mind is a dangerous thing that creates toxic leadership for oneself and others. “Misery loves company” is a saying we love to use. Data shows that Rudeness costs millions to companies. Burnout is officially a disease according to World Health Organization. Depression costs lives. In a 2019 World Happiness Report surveying 156 countries, Finland was #1 (home of some Open Source pioneers) while the US was #19. So what? Time to shift the paradigm. It is mid-2020 with a re-surging Covid-19 pandemic and it is about time to bring clarity to our vision (pun intended!) so “happiness loves company too” - becomes a new phrase to live by. “Rudeness is expensive, civility is NOT” is another line to live by too. Well, how, you ask? Through a short presentation filled with scientific data, we will define the science of leadership, outline unique attributes of servant leadership, and give examples of the same. We will end with a mindful experiential component to have fun and begin the science of self-transformation. Yes, we can transform the OSS community together with better (open=mindful) leaders, awesome innovation, funding, and quality of life for all. Thank you

so and love to see

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,840
your reaction later but this is a this

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,280
is not just a talk just to

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,519
kind of give you a little perspective

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,720
before we start this is an experiential

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,960
session as well

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,400
because talk is cheap practice is hard

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,000
so we're going to do some practice as

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,920
well which is how we

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
basically the theme of this talk is

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,720
surveyed succeed the open

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
which means yogic mindful wave so i'll

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,720
kind of decipher some of

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,320
these terminology that we sometimes use

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,880
and we have forgotten what these words

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,479
are

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,159
it's all about preventing and reversing

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,479
burnout which is a real issue

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,920
uh from boardrooms to classrooms to home

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,079
rooms that's the idea here

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,680
again thanks for coming uh just quickly

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,240

but uh the the the four corners of this

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,040
slide you see

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,640
are the loyalties that gurukul is the

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,360
institution that we co-founded

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,600
with my better half my wife uh over that

00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,880
my team unit at the bottom you see

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,759

so club here is my better half manju so

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,959
that's who

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,800

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,480
are the two we have co-founded

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,720

means happy

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,200
so our whole theme here is creating

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,280
happiness

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,879
in the boardrooms in the classrooms and

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,720
homeless all right so with that again

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,360
i've been in the open source world for a

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,120
long time

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,640
i was with sun micro systems in uh late

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,640
late 90s so again i go back there and um

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,920
i'm an open source evangelist so with

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,040
that let's get started

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,400
um i'll be in this presentation mode

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,560
here so

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,080
so so first and foremost thank you that

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,760
we don't do enough of this

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,360
i hope you agree that we don't say thank

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,519
you enough so this is my

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,959
sincere way of saying thank you to all

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,120
of you that who have come here

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,400
and attended uh and and later on any

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,080
reaction you may have

00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,519
good but ugly feel free to share but

00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,920
this is my thank you in any language

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,599
that

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,480
pleases you so that's my little thank

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,920
you to start with all right um

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,760
also this is the middle of the day for

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,800
me i'm yet to have my

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,480
food so this is a little humor hope you

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,080
are open to this some humor

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,840
again this is the end of your day or

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,640
beginning of the day hope this

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,599
gets a giggle and chuckle uh for you on

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,800
the left side is

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,040
something that actually i do for a

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,680
living i do tell people to simplify

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,239
their lives

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,799
uh breathe better and of course drink

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,560
water

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,319
so as you can see that we have forgotten

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,000
the simple things of life

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,680
and we call ourselves a very successful

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,080
species so that's a little humor on the

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,760
left

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,000
on the right is the open source

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,799
community hope you see yourself there as

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,720
overworked

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,480
uh really you have a purpose with which

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,400
you are in this open source

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,000
so you're all santa's here but in the

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,840
process you do exhaust yourself

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,280
over exhaustion is uh actually one of

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,440
the uh

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,280
prime things about burnout and on the

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,959
right here is a nurse that again let's

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,439
give us a shout out to the frontliners

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,239
for

00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,000
fighting this covet as we speak so uh

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,400
again is a little sense of humor but

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,720
there's

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,200
some seriousness behind it as well so so

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,200
with that uh let's now get to the agenda

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,400
uh if i may this is the 40 minute

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,040
conversation

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,720
uh about three minutes into it so we

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,920
will as i said it's an experiential

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,439
session so we'll do actually some

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,160
practice at the beginning

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,359
uh so that you have a certain mindset

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,359
with which we start

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,639
and then about 20 minutes of actually a

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,400
conversation

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,240
in that we'll consider why why this is

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,360
an important topic in this open source

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,919
community

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,280
as well as in general uh in your home in

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,280
your classrooms in your

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,800
conference rooms and board rooms and of

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,479
course a science i'm a scientist by

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,320
training computer scientist doubly

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,000
electrical engineer so we are talking

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,680
science here there's no mumbo jumbo

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,840
even though it may sometimes seem that

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,680
way uh when things are too simple

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,280
so so we'll consider the why and the

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,520
science uh we'll actually

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,120
uh this is my published work i'll talk

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,360
about the leadership attributes

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,520
uh called the open slash yogic

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,919
leadership uh which is a published work

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,720
uh

00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,240
that you can read up as well and then of

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,960
course some team building ideas that at

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,720
the end of the day

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,320
we work in teams whether we are at home

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,000
there's a home team as i mentioned at

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,759
the on the beginning slide

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,280
at work there are teams and whether

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,840
you're a team leader or

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,720
just member of the team these ideas will

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,400
help you

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,919
i will kind of define what team is all

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,400
about in this open way

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,280
so that i hope it opens your minds and

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,000
helps you towards the self

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,759
transformation experience

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,759
and of course some key learnings for my

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,520
own 50 plus years of life

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,120
and then some takeaways from this

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,840
presentation and will end with some

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,280
practice

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,280
as i mentioned practice practice

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,960
practices really how we get there

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,400
so we're going to do some practice at

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,240
the end and take some q a

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,759
so that's kind of my division of labor

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,479
here for this uh time

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,199
um and and let's let's let's go forward

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,440
so

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,039
before you practice before you i just

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,639
want you to be aware

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,080
so right now if you put your hand under

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,000
your nose right left doesn't matter and

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,680
just observe your breathing

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,840
maybe your right nostril is active maybe

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,360
your left is active maybe both

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,639
hope it's not none because that means

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,759
you're not breathing or you're holding

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,840
the breath

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,280
and when we angry we hold a breath uh

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,960
when you're sometimes you know

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,520
just frozen so to speak so just let go

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,039
so just observe you know no judgment

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,240
here just obser observation

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,680
right left both are not okay and you may

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,080
enter that in your chat if you like or

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,759
just keep it with yourself

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,280
so now a little disclaimer also that

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,680
when you do anything with yourself

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,720
take care of yourself uh use caution so

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,319
don't overdo it

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,759
sometimes the ego kicks in saying oh i

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,080
can do better than someone else

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,880
you know we are taught to compete in the

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,120
process we

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,720
forget that we can be our worst enemies

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,840
so just listen to your body and the mind

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,720
when we do some practice

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,919
all right so with that uh well sharon is

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,319
our moderator here

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,639
um so i have a picture of a woman you

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,800
know multitasking juggling

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,479
with so many of the tasks that we all

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,440
can relate to whether you're a man woman

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,680
or any other

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,759
gender uh that you relate to so this is

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,599
a universal issue of uh

00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,280
you know multitasking too much on our

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,240
plate i hope you all agree

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,160
so with that we start with some practice

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,360
we call abc's

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:11,199
now very simple because we never forget

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,960
so what is all about if we're aware

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,800
so right now as we speak just become

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,759
aware of yourself you could be sitting

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,039
you could be standing

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,759
i'm sitting right now but i'll be

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,520
standing a little later and uh

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,120
just become aware of your body there may

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,120
be some tension somewhere

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,680
tingling somewhere just become aware no

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,319
judgment no reaction

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,319
enjoy that awareness you're scanning the

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,680
body from toes to your head

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,240
it could be your lower back talking to

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,160
you could be a neck

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,160
we overuse our neck these days with the

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,199
gadgets that we carry

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,280
so just become aware of your body your

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,000
eyes your jaw

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,680
so much tension we build everywhere so

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,759
that's your awareness of the body from

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,000
toes to your head

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,520
next comes b b for breathing become

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
aware of your breathing as i mentioned

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,960
a hand under your nose observe the

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,960
breathing

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,639
right left you may even observe the

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,919
breathing at your belly

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,039
belly rising and falling with your

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:09,120
breath just awareness of the breath

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,720
then comes the awareness of the thought

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,840
that's the million dollar thing

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,440
60 to 80 000 thoughts a day folks we

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,039
have cluttered with the thoughts

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,199
and negative thoughts come first this is

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,280
science eighty percent of our thoughts

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,319
are negative

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,160
by nature and then 95 are repeated

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,919
so we live their lives again and again

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,720
and again old grudges

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,120
old issues we are never in the present

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,959
so

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,120
abc is about being in the present being

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,240
aware your body your breath your

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,279
thoughts

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,719
now the magic happens take a deep breath

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,120
i'll just move to the next slide just to

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:46,480
show this is the heart

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,760
his heart is very symbolic

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,760
so when you take a deep breath

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:57,200
slowly expanding your belly chest

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,760
shoulders feel energized

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,920
you're receiving that beautiful energy

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,279
and then you're letting go

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,399
exhale completely the shoulders chest

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:13,680
belly button going in all the way

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:15,760
again slowly breathe in and breathe out

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,800
remember you're as open source community

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,120
you're givers

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,560
you're purpose driven but in the process

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,800
you forget to receive

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,480
so this time this 40 minutes is time to

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,760
receive

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,760
enjoy being a receiver

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,120
you may open your mouth to exhale but

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,839
exhale longer take your time

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,839
no rush again take a deep breath in

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,600
just let go let go let go and as we

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,560
restore the rhythm of our breathing

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,040
we are restoring the rhythm of our life

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,240
that's

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,440
your 101 of burnout prevention burnout

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,959
reversal

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,959
breath is your best friend right under

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,040
your nose you feel it

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,440
and enjoy six liters of your lung

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,000
capacity you're using it

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,680
and slowing down consciously heart rate

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,839
coming down

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,600
your respiration rate coming down blood

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,839
pressure coming down

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,839
you're in the present in a steady state

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,279
so that's little experiment here of just

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,360
being here with your body with your

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,120
breath your thoughts

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,600
taking some deep breaths and being in

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,760
the center

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,360
hope that felt good and now this pause

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,279
you're welcome to put something in your

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,959
chat to say how did you feel

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,959
i worked with kiddos a lot they gave

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,600
spontaneous reaction oh i felt so

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,720
peaceful

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,399
so relaxed okay spontaneous be

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,680
spontaneous don't analyze too much we

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,920
analyze too much

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,519
so this is beautiful action we just did

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,279
we did practice centering

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,440
and then with that you felt something

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,640
the outcome so again i'm using the

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,320
corporate lingo here

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,079
there's an input there's an output

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,680
there's an outcome here but in that

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,440
in the process we did some actions all

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,519
right hope that helped so that was a

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,079
little practice at the beginning

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,560
now you say why do we care prashanth hey

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,320
you know

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,000
so this is really where i share the

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,079
problem statement okay

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,440
you're it remember you are it you have

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,600
to be is the tag

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,560
tag a game that used to play as kiddos

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,959
okay

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,040
you are the person that you need to take

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,240
care of yourself this is self-care 101.

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,040
so what's the problem

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,720
okay it turns out that we are all human

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,959
emotional animals hope you agree

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,720
uh today's keynote talked about empathy

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,640
and so many other things about

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,959
team building and words your language

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,000
matters so we are emotional animals

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,240
emotions rule us and as i

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,920
shared at the beginning of the practice

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,120
you know negative thoughts come first

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,120
so cynicism is kind of so much into us

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,160
we are cynical we are skeptical which is

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,959
good from

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,800
you know again as a curious being

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,880
optimism comes as a second

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,079
thing right cynicism comes first

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,480
optimism comes second

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,959
so this is kind of a norm all right i'm

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,839
just stating the the state of the state

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,120
now these three emotions the reason i'm

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,639
sharing this at the beginning is we have

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,279
some good news later

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,320
so fear sadness anger hope you agree

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,120
that they kind of rule us

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,839
you know anger management anxiety

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,240
management

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,680
and they become chronic chronic sadness

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,440
we call it depression

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,880
and then people take pills and what not

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,600
some other solutions

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,560
but we want comprehensive solutions

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,839
permanent solution

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,360
we prevent and reverse these emotions

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,480
again relatively speaking right we are

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,639
not going to eliminate them

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,720
but we're going to reduce their impact

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,200
on us so that's kind of the state of the

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,040
state of who we are as human beings

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,839
and this is where some data comes in

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,560
okay illness is expensive illness is not

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,639
now why unless it's expensive

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,920
it just so happens that this is real

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,760
real data

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,680
impact on productivity absenteeism

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,920
employee retention healthcare cost

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,800
okay i'm some u.s numbers but they're

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,279
global numbers too

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,560
burnout okay burnout is an official

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,600
diagnosable disease

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,720
uh as defined by who world health

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,680
organization

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,360
125 billion to 190 billion dollars in

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,680
health care costs per year there's a

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,120
harvard business review data okay this

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,120
is a real

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,160
500 billion half a trillion dollars in

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,160
lost productivity

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,240
oh i don't feel well i have a headache

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,040
now i'll just take a day off

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,160
so all of this combined together

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,320
employers

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,320
okay and we all are again whether you're

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,639
a startup or a slavish company

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,480
these are real uh dollars that are

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,680
costing the economy and then of course

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,880
costing your lives

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,720
uh in the process so a big number okay

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,800
to be aware of this every year by the

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,600
way and this is even a bigger number

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,360
this is 47 trillion dollars okay if we

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,560
don't take care of ourselves that's the

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,360
impact the global

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,480
economy here uh in terms of ncds now in

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,399
series

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,320
to be remembered is non-communicable

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,880
diseases covert is a communicable

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,720
disease

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,399
but whatever we are sharing here today

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,000
is applicable to

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,079
non-communicable disease as well which

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,079
is cancer diabetes heart disease

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,240
respiratory ailments you know all of

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:05,440
those things that we are clicked by

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,600
so tremendous uh suffering uh

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,120
economically uh personally

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,000
professionally and so on and so forth so

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,079
that's kind of the

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,480
the crimp picture i'm painting initially

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,959
to say hey what do we do about it

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,320
so now we say rudeness well rudeness is

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,639
expensive civility is not

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,240
again this is real data that i'm sharing

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,560
is a nice ted talk that you may want to

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,120
uh

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,880
look at as by christine porath talks

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,959
about why respect for being respectful

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,199
to the co-workers is good for business

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,160
it's not just a good thing as you're uh

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,120
you know taught in

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,760
at home and at school as hey be kind be

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,920
good

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,000
but this is also good for business why

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,600
well cisco has a real data here

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,519
it was costing them 12 million dollars

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,720
because of rudeness that means you you

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,040
may lose an employee

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,040
you may lose a customer more importantly

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,760
that no business is coming if there's no

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,519
customer

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,279
so this is again real data cisco then

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,639
created a global workplace initiative

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,480
with which they started dealing with

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,920
rudeness so these are all human

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,800
emotions remember we act impulsively we

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,000
react

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,000
okay and all this is preventable okay

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,600
so this is kind of the data and and this

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,920
is where i define what burnout

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,680
really means and you all have seen the

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,320
apollo 13 movie houston we have a

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,240
problem

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,600
i live in austin by the way austin texas

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,240
and i always say austin we have a

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,839
solution

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,279
so that's what we're going to talk about

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,519
in the next couple of slides

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,440
is is delhi what's the solution here but

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,399
let's define what the problem is right

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,160
it's the chronic workplace stress that

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,079
has not been successfully managed

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,240
and what happens because of that extreme

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,880
exhaustion we are cynical towards our

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,959
jobs

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,800
we can distance ourselves reduce

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,600
efficacy we are there but we are not

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,360
there

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,360
so i'm sure we all have noticed that in

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,440
some shape or form but this is real

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,120
uh definition of burnout so take it

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,480
seriously and what are the causes and

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,320
effects right so what is

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,600
what causes burnout again there's a

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,600
chicken and egg problem

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,959
but it all comes back to leadership as

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,279
i'll paint a picture here

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,120
okay lack of control and power at work

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,800
okay boredom or chaos

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,800
problem in social life heavy workloads

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,199
right plate is always full

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,920
we never say how to do say no but then

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,240
what are the real

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,440
uh you know symptoms here what are the

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,519
signs and then

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,720
you see the list here we all can relate

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,639
to some of that uh

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,000
at one point or the other even today for

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,040
that matter you may have had

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,839
you know uh just before this uh

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,519
uh as a speaker i had some anxiety so i

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,199
took some deep breaths okay so i'm kind

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,560
of practicing what i'm sharing here

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,519
anyway so this is kind of the cause and

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,199
effect picture

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,279
now let's get to the the good news here

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,079
okay the good news is there's a science

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,199
here at

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,560
work okay so what am i what am i saying

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,519
what's the equation at the

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,440
upfront is higher emotional intelligence

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,800
okay there's a higher resilience

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,880
so we all need to be emotionally

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,040
intelligent you're you're all brilliant

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,120
as open source uh you know community

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,320
uh you do amazing stuff there's a lot of

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,320
iq here

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,320
sometimes the eq is compromised in the

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,680
process okay so i'm what i'm saying here

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,399
is let's focus on the emotional

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,720
intelligence

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,759
while you all are awesomely intelligent

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,000
so what is this all about

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,880
neuroplasticity there's not a new phrase

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
it was kind of uh started uh someone by

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,799
the name of don hebb

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,160
started using in 1949 and he he had a

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,679
famous line there called

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,720
neurons are tried together while

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,640
together okay so this is reversible

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,079
if i'm an angry person i can become a

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,199
peaceful person

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,720
oh vice versa if i'm at peace yeah i can

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,400
become an angry person too that's why we

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,079
need to practice the right things

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,679
at the right time so this is how our

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,000
brain works you know there's so much of

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,839
a

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,440
talk think of our thinking brain the

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,880
rational brain the right left

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,480
but then there's the limbic brain the

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,240
emotional brain

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,919
and that's what we need to focus on here

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,280
so that how do we really address that

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,400
and then there's a reptilian brain which

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,919
is a fight or flight

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,600
uh and if you're in that mode all the

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,600
time you're in that stressed out mode

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,000
the chronic stress the chronic burnout

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,679
okay so we want to be

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,640
caring of our limbic brain that's kind

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,000
of the the punch line here out of that

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,000
so what are we saying here again

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,960
emotional intelligence that term came in

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,880
1990s

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,000
it existed forever of course and what

00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,720
are the components of emotional

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,679
intelligence

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,440
right self-awareness self-regulation

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,559
motivation

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,240
empathy social skills

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,000
so these are the kind of components of

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,559
social uh emotional intelligence as you

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,559
can see

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,160
why they're important now so that you

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,919
prevent and reverse burn out

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,400
okay so you've got to be aware as we

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,640
said we become aware of your body

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,000
that pain in your back back pain lower

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,200
back pain become aware

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,840
and then we're going to solve it okay

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,360
regulation motivation empathy that

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,720
camille mentioned in the in the morning

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,720
at the keynote about empathy

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,880
and then i also go further to say

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,160
compassion over empathy

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,240
which means you're actually taking some

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,440
action all right now yoga you know you

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,280
must have heard of yoga

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,120
a lot or you're practicing it already

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,600
but this is our own little acronym here

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,320
for you

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,039
it's your own great asset your body is

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,360
an asset

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,280
sometimes becomes a liability mind is an

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,919
asset becomes a liability so we say hey

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,000
yoga is

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,200
your own great asset take care of it and

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,280
what's the definition

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,960
again as a scientist i like to define so

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,559
this is the definition by patanjali

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,880
there's a scientist behind us

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,320
uh the einstein of yoga if i may call it

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,280
it's and this is the simplified

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,880
definitions is

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,440
calming the vibrations of the mind is

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,559
yoga so that's what yoga is all about is

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,120
being you know calming take a deep

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,840
breath

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,320
slow down all that clutter 60 to 80 000

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,039
thoughts

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,080
let's slow down so we have clarity with

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,919
which we act

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,679
and then hopefully a compassionate

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,360
action so it's a great tool for self

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,000
management to self transformation

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,760
so this is kind of the the and then the

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,400
word mindfulness sometimes people don't

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,200
use it

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,799
separately or this yoga or which people

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,919
think of bending yourself like a pretzel

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,000
there's mindfulness

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,679
so what is mindfulness it's a quality of

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
being in the present

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,000
fully engaged with whatever you're doing

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,720
without judgment or reaction

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,679
so when you take a pause you're mindful

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,600
of your body your breath your thoughts

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,039
but now you go next step so that's why i

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,000
call it yoga as a superset of

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,080
mindfulness

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,160
it's not there's no compartments here it

00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,360
is the same terms this used differently

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,280
so buddha kind of uh you know perfected

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,400
that art of being mindful

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,640
uh then john cabezin in u.s

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,640
mass general kind of made brought into

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,159
mainstream so now yoga and mindfulness

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,720
all in the mainstream so that's what i'm

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,360
saying

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,039
let's become mindful and i tie this to

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,640
do openness

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,400
some inspiration for you here hope that

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,640
helps this inspiration and there's a

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,240
there's also a ted talk by simon sinek

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,679
whether you like him or not it's a

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,799
really good thing about

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,600
why we heard today this morning

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,320
so so the why matters okay so why are we

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,400
here

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,840
why do you do what you do okay and

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,960
there's a biology again that talks

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,960
that's why this brain

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,159
matters your limbic brain the emotional

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,679
brain that why

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,360
but see these leaders what are they

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,039
talking about right these are

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,880
fathers of their own nations nelson

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,559
mandela mahatma gandhi

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,880
gandhi's birthday is coming up october

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,320
2nd and then what are they saying

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,799
they're basically saying give the credit

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,559
away

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,080
take the blame so you need a lot of

00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,159
courage you need to be bold

00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,840
to do something okay really out of the

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,000
box and that's what uh

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,120
so just some inspiration for you with

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,120
which i weave

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,240
the next slide which is the attributes

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,400
of yogic leadership

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,840
and i call this open leadership okay and

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,799
this is my published work

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,039
and you can look it up later so what am

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,799
i

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,240
saying here again a five-year-old can

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,880
spell leader lea

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,400
er or if you're in the boardroom yeah

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,679
all the leaders you know so much of talk

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,440
of leadership there's this

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,960
uh big you know trillions of dollars are

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,360
spent on leadership training

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,640
but we forget the simplicity of it and

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,600
that's what we are all about is

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,720
developing leaders

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,120
means in the first place take a deep

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,320
breath

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,120
and let go when crisis comes sometimes

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,559
people say oh

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,440
he's such a great leader he was so

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:43,440
bashful so you know like a bully

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,200
and that is not sustainable leadership

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,720
so what we're saying is be level headed

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,679
to be a sustainable leader

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,280
a open leader okay efficient yeah be in

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,080
the present i've been given 40 minutes

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,159
for this talk

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,280
if i overuse my time i'm not being

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,280
efficient i may

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,280
have to be cautious here of that as well

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,159
here okay so efficiency about being in

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,480
the present

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,000
so i'm not wavering uh from past to the

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,000
future being anxious

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,159
or lamenting just being in the present

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,679
aware be open

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,919
as we said be aware of your breath

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,360
be aware of your thoughts as as uh i

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,400
think kim mentioned this morning be

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,640
aware of your words

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,559
the choice of your words okay so that

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,720
awareness daring be bold

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,400
don't be an appeaser i mean that doesn't

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,919
get you anywhere if you're burnt out

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,360
and then you're still doing something

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,880
because you're afraid of saying

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,480
something to your boss

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,400
then you're not being a good leader in

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,480
yourself the individual contributor is a

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,559
team leader so be daring

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,760
exemplary that's very simple but it's

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,919
very important

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,600
do what you say so lead by example is

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,960
what we say and then the punch line

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,360
becomes righteous

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,320
you know do the right thing right we say

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,039
it but we don't

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,679
always do it all right so so with that

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,400
said

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,919
so let's uh now you know how we

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,120
implement it right okay so these are the

00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,679
attributes of leadership

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,480
it's published it's all there i've given

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,880
enough uh

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,520
presentations on this so how does this

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,039
really imp

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,880
how do you implement this right and have

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,440
some numbers that uh it's in the backup

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,679
slide

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,280
but let's talk about the team then now

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,640
you're part of the team

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:15,120
see if this relates to you better be

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,840
a trusted person here on the team or

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,480
your leader be

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,520
a trusted person empathetic accountable

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,280
motivated

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,640
otherwise you don't feel you want to do

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,320
something today right

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,640
so if you're not motivated you will not

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,600
get out of the bed so again being a

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,600
successful team

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,720
really means you're it's a trusted team

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,720
a trusted leader

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,320
empathetic accountable motivated and

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,120
with that becomes leadership becomes

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,960
successful

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,640
so teams are at the root of you know

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,720
leadership being successful

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,320
if i'm the ceo i won't be successful

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,919
unless my team is successful

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,840
or if you're an individual contributor

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,039
yeah you can be that bottleneck between

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,919
success and failure

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,200
so so then um there's some ideas here

00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,520
again of

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,200
team building and wellness uh and this

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,480
is the phrase that's not mine but see if

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,360
that resonates with you

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,640
that illness starts with i too much of i

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,400
can create a lot of

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,679
headaches for yourself and others and

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,320
wellness starts with we

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,520
so it's a lot of we here okay so some

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,640
ideas here of

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,880
wellness mindful monday meals uh

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,840
monday we all dread mondays do we uh how

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,400
don't we

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,320
so hopefully this will uh you know give

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,400
you some perspective on how to

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,320
deal with mondays with uh something

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,120
mindful even virtually by the way okay

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,960
yeah so wellness one day uh wednesday

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,799
walks today is a wednesday

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,559
i call it a wellness wednesday yeah so

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,120
go for a quiet walk

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,919
mindful walk so beautiful activities so

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,360
that we are really

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,039
decluttering ourselves so we have

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,960
clarity and we also

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,559
uh become well in the process the blood

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,400
pressure the diabetes

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,919
these are all real issues that we can

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,559
solve with the simplicity

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,679
of this and then this is passionate

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,080
camaraderie

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,159
okay sometimes you may be very effective

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,520
as a team member because you're great at

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:57,440
your domain uh skill but uh you may be a

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,880
mess on the emotional side so how do you

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,840
become this compassionate

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,200
uh you know team builders and and so be

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,919
like camaraderie so i have some ideas

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,320
i've done this

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,360
in a confidence setting you know i was

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,080
in china for a

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,400
open source unconference in november and

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,559
i

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,000
did something like that as well there so

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,400
so you could be anywhere and you could

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,720
be doing this virtually or physically

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,840
still some ideas here all right so uh

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,840
i'm just going to

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,840
take a pause here how are we doing uh

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,480
hopefully people are attending and uh

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,159
okay

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,480
so let me just get back here um so these

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:33,120
are some key learning i'm just going to

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,679
not read everything out of it here but

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,320
you see

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,679
so this is about my 50 plus years of

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,159
life that i'm sharing here

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,520
okay we are so much focused on

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,000
destination we forget the

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,640
actual journey itself so enjoy the

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,720
journey

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,400
okay good bad ugly just have the

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,600
perspective that there's a reason why

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,840
this is ugly right now

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,960
it will become good later positivity

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,880
there

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,200
soft is strong is very important right

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,760
we have to be in that mode of

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,039
softness is a beautiful thing being

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,360
brash being a bully

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,360
is people think oh that's a great leader

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,159
and we say hard-nosed

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,159
soft-spoken so your choice but over the

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,120
time you'll notice soft spoken is where

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,720
actually you win

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:17,120
so to speak okay ally is very important

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,640
okay at all levels uh and then of course

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,240
have passion and compassion not just

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,240
passion can become dry

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,919
and then this is the punch line is be

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,720
selfish to be selfless meaning take care

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,480
of yourself

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,760
so you can do a lot of giving work in

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,000
the open source world

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,679
uh you're doing something altruistic but

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,480
first take care of yourself also in the

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,400
process right

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:38,240
so so that's the key learnings and then

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,240
finally the the takeaways here

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,919
let me just kind of build those out here

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,960
so

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,559
hope what we saw here in the last 25 30

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,960
minutes of the conversation

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,080
is burnout it is a real thing so take it

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,559
seriously

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,559
it's preventable it's reversible so make

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:58,240
sure that we we take care of it that way

00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:59,440
and then um you know the definitions

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,279
matter right so yoga

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,480
your own great asset calming the

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,400
vibrations of mind

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,480
mindfulness all these become a great

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,320
toolkit here for circa

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,000
so so that's kind of the idea here and

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,720
then i hope you saw those leadership

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,919
attributes

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,320
the the yogic leader leadership is being

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,799
open

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,840
being aware being exemplary being

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,159
efficient

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,600
being level headed and all that and all

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,360
that you know builds that

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,039
emotional intelligence and with that

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,080
builds you high resilience so that you

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,760
can recover

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,360
right getting into a trouble is one

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,000
thing but recovering from it that's up

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,559
to you

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,360
and again with the support system uh and

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,399
with your own

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,880
practice you will actually come out of

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,840
it

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,600
clean and even better and then i say my

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,559
final takeaway here is practice makes

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,120
perfect

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,720
but then i change it to optimal so if

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,440
you are becoming a perfectionist all the

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,880
time

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,720
you'll have a frown on your face more

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,120
than a smile

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,760
and i'm a stickler for smiling versus

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,080
being frowned

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,200
uh you know so grumpy face and that's

00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,159
why we're going to do some practice

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,399
right now

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,000
to to get to an optimal efficiency of we

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,880
as human beings all right

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,440
so with that said let's let's do some

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,799
practice

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,120
all right so i'm going to build this

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,520
slide out and then i'm going to go into

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,640
the

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:15,200
screen where i may even ask sharon to

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,640
show herself if that's okay with her and

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,960
we shall do some practice

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:23,120
all right so so far so good folks

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,279
so here if i may if i may i'm just going

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,559
to get up a little bit if you don't mind

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:30,080
uh get this thing out hey

all right thank you thank you for being

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,080

so as you can see i'm standing for a

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,799
conscious reason because we sit for too

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,399
long

00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,320
and then we get into trouble you know we

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,799

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,159
how is it cooperating

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:27,120
remember disuse happens misuse happens

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,520
overuse happens

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,559

and i ask a trick question hey sharon

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,840
who's your best friend

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:44,240
the moment no no that that's very

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,840
that's very kind of you but the idea of

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,279
giving a self-huggy this is why i call

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,159

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,320
yourself okay that's the that's the

00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,720
graphic there

that i was sharing there let me just

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,480
maximize that if that

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,520
helps so so remember so move the body

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,919
steady the mind

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,600
okay you are your best friend and the

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,960
next thing comes as

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:13,039
okay so i have a new new new little uh

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,720
okay we all have this gadget you know i

00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:17,440
call this a drug

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,720
we all are drug lords using this mobile

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,039
for too long

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,360
okay and with this mobile we are like

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,039
this all the time

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,880
and our cervical vertebrae are being

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:30,000
impacted okay

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,320
so what i say here is keep the mobile

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,799
away that's called nemobile arsenal okay

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,640
mobilizing and i say knee mobile asana

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,039
so what i mean mean by that okay

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,960
so we are in this mode and i say open up

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:44,399
take a deep breath

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,799
ah i'm free see so

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,840
we have to do this a lot okay we're

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,120
doing this a lot

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:53,440
we're becoming like this okay open

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,360
up cervical vertebrae working for you

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,679
take a deep breath in

00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,679
ah

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,320
all right hope that feels good again

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:05,039
this is a heart opener

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,519
sadness is impacting your heart so open

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,200
up

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,120
so this is also a heart opener a lung

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,159
opener this is the real solution here a

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,720
simple solution

00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,399
during the day get up and then open up

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,640
get get this drug out of the way

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,600
okay so that's my little uh punch line

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,760
here then

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,120
and the final thing here sharon you're

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,440
such a great uh

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,880
you're such a great laughter okay so

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,399
you're already laughing before i

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,240
ask you to so folks be good

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,000
be good sports right now okay so take a

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,280
deep breath in

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:44,840
and you're on broadway burst out into

00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:46,799
[Laughter]

00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,200
laughter

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,919
so so the punch line here is the punch

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,240
line is

00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,279
acceleration equals relaxation you see

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,600
that

00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,120
exhalation it was relaxation though so

00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,120
the laughter is still the best medicine

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,519
for a reason as we exhale we empty out

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,480
the lungs all still air

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,600
you feel energized recharged so make

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,960
sure you're getting enough laughter

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,200
every day

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,640
it's that says we get just laugh about

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,039
four times a day

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,279
and the children laugh about food and

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:18,399
the children laugh about 400 times a day

00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:20,880
so what's wrong with this picture yeah

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,799
so so that is the idea here that folks

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,799
uh you know take care of yourself

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,159
uh so laugh i'm just gonna go back to

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,159
sitting if that's okay

00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,519
and then we'll uh we'll end here with

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,159
little silence okay

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,120
so that's the idea folks uh hope hope

00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,679
that

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,399
helps you a little uh practice component

00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,440
of it

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,640
and then we'll we'll end here okay with

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,960
some silence

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,200
if that's okay with you so now as we saw

00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,840
in this presentation so far

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,799
right practice practice practice talking

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:53,360
cheap

00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:56,320
practice is hard so

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:59,519
let's get back to some silence

00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,960
decluttering ourselves

00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:07,760
time to heal to receive your all givers

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:12,000
we forget to receive so enjoy receiving

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:14,320
with gratitude again this is science

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,600
when you give yourself five minutes out

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,360
of the day

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:22,640
it's a great roi you get okay

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:26,880
so five minutes gives you 23 hours

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:29,360
and 55 minutes of quality of the day

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,640
so chronic burnout let's get rid of it

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,320
chronic fatigue

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:37,679
chronic exhaustion so recharge yourself

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,440
moment to moment on a daily basis

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,360
so next one minute a little bit of

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,279
silence

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,399
i'll have a little singing hole here

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:53,039
with me

00:33:44,399 --> 00:34:07,840
you can enjoy the sound

00:33:53,039 --> 00:34:07,840
just enjoy

00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:14,260
[Music]

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,879
all right that was a little practice

00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,960
here

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:30,079
so now since we just did the practice

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,079
again observe your breathing

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,599
with this your right your left we're

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,599
both the idea again is

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,639
if you're from anxiety mode you go into

00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,440
a calmer mode

00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,879
so this is real empirical evidence that

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,760
you can have

00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,720
and with that i will take a pause i

00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,040
thank you we'll

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:53,440
answer any questions and hope

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:21,520
at the apache con at home and

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,000
many friends to thank here for allowing

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,440
me to do

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,160
this and uh all right um

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,760
again i'm here uh for the next three

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,920
minutes at least and then

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,359
we'll leave this uh platform and then

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:38,000
i'll be available in the

00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:38,000
hallways and other places to answer any

00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,839
questions

00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,240
what kind of breaks do you like to

00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,560
employ during the day i feel that they

00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,800
are

00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,680
more necessary now with work from home

00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,960
especially

00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,200
so raymond first of all thank you for

00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,680
your question so

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,640
simple as that one is we got to get some

00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,720
fresh air

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,880
every day all right so if you're sitting

00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,680
for too long in front of the computer

00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,599
every 20 minutes do get up if you have

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,400
the ability to go out and get some fresh

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,880
air

00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,200
do walk bare feet again this is a very

00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,480
important bare feet walk on the grass

00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,079
okay or get some sunshine very important

00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,680
make sure you're hydrating yourself so

00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,680
take some water breaks so

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,320
so simple and then stretches also if

00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,000
you're sitting you're bending forward

00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,480
today was not the time to

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,200
do some more uh um comprehensive

00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,119
practice

00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,839
but the practice is to bend forward and

00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,400
backwards breathe open up

00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,599
and then of course go down so you sit

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,839
without a gadget

00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,920
uh you know no glasses no nothing just

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:55,359
close your eyes and enjoy the darkness

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,720
so many many ways you can take breaks um

00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:59,680
to just you know so that you're not

00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,800
burnt out

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,119
thank you for the question hope that

00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,119
helps

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,040
all right awesome

00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:15,119
so uh yeah so folks so the idea again is

00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,880
that this is

00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,240
real this is uh we are doing this with

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,240
doctors by the way

00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:24,560
uh and and you know board rooms so that

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,240
uh there's less of a burnout there and

00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,720
as you know doctors have a very tough

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,520
lot

00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,400
of life right now with kovid in

00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,400
particular

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,680
and wearing the mask all the time and

00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,839
there's so much happening so i have

00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,599
created some audio recordings for them

00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,960
so it's just bite size two minutes three

00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,839
minutes and there's

00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,480
many many ways we can prevent and

00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:44,880
reverse

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,560
uh these issues so you can sleep better

00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,800
and that's another thing right the sleep

00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,599
is

00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,400
we are all asleep deprived society so

00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,720
this and then

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,560
it impacts our day-to-day life uh you

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,320
can become a better

00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,920
grumpy boss and that that doesn't help

00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,480
the ecosystem there

00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,760
so it's really comes back to no matter

00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,520
what role you play

00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,440
as an individual contributor or a team

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,200
leader uh this is for you

00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,040
and that's why take it seriously and

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,599
practice practice practice

00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,760
again i thank you for your time it's uh

00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,440
114 my time so i think we may have to

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,920
leave the room in in a minute

00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,640
but i really appreciate you uh joining

00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:25,839
here

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:25,839
and attending this session so

00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,400
yeah the alternate is during the day

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,240
that is true uh but again the good news

00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,040
is we can make it voluntary daniel

00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,000
uh to to make our breathing uh you know

00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,400
where we want to be

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,079
so in a calm state or an active state so

00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,400
that's the beauty that is voluntary you

00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,319
can

00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,079
have a voluntary control over your

00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,480
breathing and that's the crux of this

00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,920
whole

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,400
uh yoga mindfulness session all right

00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,960
folks uh again i really appreciate your

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,319
time

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,560
i think we'll have to leave right now as

00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:00,000
maybe some other session has to come but

00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,680
uh really appreciate

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,839
