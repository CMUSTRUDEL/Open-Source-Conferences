The Apache Way is how the Apache Software Foundation works. It's a collection of tribal knowledge and stories that loosely define how we work. Not all of it is intuitive but it does work. In 21 years we have changed the way computing around the world happens through our mission to provide open source software to the world and doing so at no charge! Want to work more effectively with the foundation? Want to model our leadership? Want to bring a new project under our umbrella? Come learn more about the Apache Way! Kevin A. McGrail has served in a number of roles at the foundation as member, as a chairperson, in the incubator, as a mentor, in the treasury and in fundraising. He will talk about his experience and some of the mistakes he's made too.
