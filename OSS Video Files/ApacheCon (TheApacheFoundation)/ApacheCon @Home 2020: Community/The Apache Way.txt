	The Apache Way
Kevin A. McGrail

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

The Apache Way is how the Apache Software Foundation works. It's a collection of tribal knowledge and stories that loosely define how we work. Not all of it is intuitive but it does work. In 21 years we have changed the way computing around the world happens through our mission to provide open source software to the world and doing so at no charge! Want to work more effectively with the foundation? Want to model our leadership? Want to bring a new project under our umbrella? Come learn more about the Apache Way! Kevin A. McGrail has served in a number of roles at the foundation as member, as a chairperson, in the incubator, as a mentor, in the treasury and in fundraising. He will talk about his experience and some of the mistakes he's made too.

kevin a mcgrail i've served in a number

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,040
of roles at the apache software

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,479
foundation

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,320
and it's really a privilege for me to

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,240
talk about the apache way

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,720
it's a little bit of the amorphous kind

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,799
of uh high level approach to how we run

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,000
the organization and how it works as a

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,680
bottom-up

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,200
organization and how it's really been

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,000
able to kind of change computing over

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,360
the last 21

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,960
years since we incorporated so i'm sad

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,159
that i'm not there in person but i'm

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,280
glad that there's so many people from

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,439
around the world that can see it and

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,960
some names that i recognize you know

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,479
curtis hello i hope to see you guys more

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,960
and you can't see my great shirt which

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,079
was the montreal apache

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,439
hockey shirt but that aside let's go

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,000
ahead and get started so

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,280
a little this is a remedial but i think

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,200
there's a lot of people who don't know

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,000
the asf you know we don't go to a lot of

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,159
trouble to talk

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
about our organization and we're very

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,840
intrinsic so for those who don't know

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,600
we're a 501c3 charity

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,960
that's a specific type of tax code in

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,119
the united states but it means we're a

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,880
charity we're not a trade organization

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,399
um that differentiates us it

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,920
differentiates us from a lot of the

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,599
organizations out there

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,760
and most people know us really for the

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,599
http server and the apache software

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,760
license also known as the asl

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,360
v2 our mission is very simple we provide

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,760
software for the public good

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,599
and we do so by providing services and

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,760
supporting the projects that

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,440
uh come to us and the communities of

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,840
individuals that make up those groups so

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,000
individuals there is very specific

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,599
it's not communities of companies and we

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,160
do this all at no charge

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,519
so free open source software that you

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,120
get into a lot of

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,879
discussions about the word free and what

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,280
it means but what we do is at no charge

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,080
the apache license is a big part of what

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,720
we're known for

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,640
so we're currently on asl v2 there's no

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,599
asl v3 that i'm aware of

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,599
in process uh it's been a long-standing

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,200
license that has served very well

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,959
and what it's known for with a lot of

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,560
corporations especially in people is

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,319
it's very permissive

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,800
and it's business friendly so it allow

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,720
it handles things like uh patent grants

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,239
and it doesn't have a copyleft provision

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,360
the copy left is a

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,000
play on words with copyright where uh

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,599
several licenses what you have to do is

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
uh you have to distribute your source

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,640
code

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,400
if you distribute your code for anything

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,440
uh the apache software license does not

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,760
require that

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,799
uh as i often say you know build a

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,360
company

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,280
use our software make a billion dollars

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,080
you owe us nothing it'd be nice if you

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,760
came and sponsored

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,680
us and and let us keep doing what we

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,480
were doing uh but you owe us nothing

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,760
there's no

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,400
no quid pro quo whatsoever but you know

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,840
for those who

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,040
have never heard of the apache software

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,680
foundation or have only heard of us

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,760
about with the apache httpd project

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,120
you know there's over 380 projects

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,519
underneath our umbrella

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,200
uh and three points that i often brought

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,720
up when i was the vp of fundraising that

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,720
resonated very well

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,000
is that 80 of the world's websites use

00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,760
some of our software

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
every smartphone on the planet uses our

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,439
software and every plane in us airspace

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,360
is tracked with our software so we're

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,599
very intrinsic as i mentioned

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,879
to how the world works but we're not

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,640
really out there trying to make

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,920
our name for ourselves into our own

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,840
horns we're happy to play

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,439
in the background and just be intrinsic

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,880
to the way computing happens and very

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,720
proud of that

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,919
we have tons of projects as i mentioned

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,000
almost 400

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,919
uh from a to z you know we have spark

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,880
tomcat spam assassin which is where i'm

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,560
involved

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,080
tons in our incubator which we'll talk

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,680
about a little bit later on

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,600
uh spark i mentioned already uh hadoop

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,120
et cetera all of these are apache

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,160
projects and more correctly called

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,280
apache hadoop or apache http

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,199
or apache spam assassin but you know i

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,639
did cheat with cersei's uh you know when

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,720
i said a to z but

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,240
uh you know for the most part we're bad

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,919
as engineers we don't know how to name

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,600
things uh very well

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,199
and some of that comes up when you see

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,560
some of the projects like zookeeper

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:59,440
so we really do have a to z zookeeper is

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,320
a way of managing and handling your

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,440
group services

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,320
it's oftentimes used a lot with hadoop

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,880
big top as well and a lot of times those

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,120
names

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,160
are as i mentioned named by engineers so

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,440
doug when he named

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,639
uh hadoop named it after his child's

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,280
stuffed elephant and elephants belong at

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,840
a

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,479
big top at the zoo hence big top came

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,520
along

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,280
hence zookeeper to i guess pick up the

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,880
the dung from the elephants i don't know

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,440
that's why he's got a shovel and whatnot

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,880
but

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,479
in any case we're not really good at

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,600
naming things but we're good at writing

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,160
code so

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,960
uh a to z uh we've been incorporated now

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,600
since march 26 of 1999 so we just

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,160
celebrated our 21st birthday birthday

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,520
um as i joke now we can have a beer

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,880
that's our original logo

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,720
i think there's actually a surfboard

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,039
that usually comes around for the

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,080
various events that you don't get to see

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,800
with that logo on it but the apache hdb

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,400
or the httpd project is really our

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,520
grandfather project it's what started

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,479
everything

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,360
and uh you know what we are um so you

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,639
know some of the things i like to

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,440
mention to people you know we're not a

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,680
democracy

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,720
what we are um you know tongue-in-cheek

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,479
is for a bunch of

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,919
elitists who believe people have no

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,000
innate right to vote

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,440
uh you have to earn merit you have to be

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,600
on a project you have to

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,840
earn the right to vote uh but after you

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,160
do um everybody has an equal vote so

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,080
there it's not a market monarchy uh we

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,440
have kings and pawns as i say side by

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,720
side literally

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,560
people who are students and and

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,840
have no income whatsoever alongside

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,520
people that might have

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,160
seven and eight figures in the bank uh

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,680
work together and solve problems

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,199
additionally as i mentioned we are not a

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,880
trade organization and

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,039
we're not really capitalists you know

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,840
you can't buy a seat on our board

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,280
we let the industry drive us rather than

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,440
us drive the industry

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,720
so for example i've had people come up

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,479
and say oh how many

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,479
projects will you guys have in iot db

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,199
next year or how many will you have on

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,160
xyz new technology and you know the

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,840
answer is i don't know

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,160
it depends on how many communities come

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,599
to us how many people uh submit projects

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,000
to the incubator how many of those

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,479
projects

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,800
are accepted um and as i said that's

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,680
that's why we let the industry drive us

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,960
we're a bottom up led organization all

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,880
volunteer led

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,160
and that lets us uh weather a lot of

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,080
things because we're not trying to

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,840
predict what the next cycle is we're

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,080
simply there to help people who are

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,800
working on that next cycle

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,240
as i mentioned we're a meritocracy so to

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,880
be able to have a say you have to prove

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,160
your worth

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,599
and that worth is judged by the

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,000
community that meritocracy is a real big

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,039
part

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,319
of the apache way but

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,639
you know before we get into the apache

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,840
wave more formally the the real question

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,759
we get asked is you know why does the

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,440
foundation exist and the the real

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,800
reason that the foundation exists is to

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,319
support the projects

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,960
so that's what i mean when i say we're a

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,639
bottom-up organization so the leadership

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,000
is there to make sure that the projects

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,039
can run we want to make sure they have

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,319
the resources

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,599
we want to make sure they have legal

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,039
protection because there's always

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,520
lawyers out there

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,479
so the asl v2 might have to be defended

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,039
we might have to

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,680
defend ip providence uh but we also want

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,039
to give

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,199
the people the ability to build a

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,400
community and build recognition we'll

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,400
talk a lot about the

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,560
community and why that's a big big big

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,440
deal it's number four on this list but

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,479
it probably should be number one

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,520
so with that said i'll get into the

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,120
very amorphous apache way so

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,280
many times when people are giving apache

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,160
way presentations they will refer to

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,319
them as

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,840
yet another apache way presentation and

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,120
the reason for that is

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:34,479
there is no uh codified apache way this

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,640
is the uh generally accepted view that i

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,880
have of how the apache way works

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,800
uh i think is very accurate and i

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,279
wouldn't uh put it out there otherwise

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,560
but

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,720
you know there's plenty of other people

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,160
and others involved with the apache that

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,839
might differ and have a different view

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,800
on how things can get done and that's

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,200
part of the great way

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,959
uh that we work is that uh we aren't set

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,880
in stone we are evolving we're

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,160
constantly working on what the next

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,839
great thing is

00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,760
and that's been a lot of the appeal that

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,279
people have had so you know we have some

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,320
rigidity when it's needed but we have

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,360
the flexibility

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,120
when it's required and that gives us

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,200
that resiliency so that's the first

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,200
thing really with the apache way that

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,720
we're resilient and people sometimes

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,560
hate it when i'm brightening this up but

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,959
oftentimes people hate the apache wave

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,440
for a few years they find it to be uh

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,560
you know a handcuff uh you know that to

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,880
shackle them and

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,480
and saddle them down and then usually

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,240
what happens is a couple years in

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,320
something happens it's different for

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,839
different people uh but some catharsis

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,000
occurs and they're like oh

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,040
that's why they do these things this way

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,560
and unfortunately

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,640
a lot of times it's been difficult to

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,240
tell people that but i will say that

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,920
stick with the apache way for a few

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,399
years you will find it to be

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,080
amazing you will find it to be a great

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,640
uh group of misfits out there in the

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,160
world

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,200
really trying to make the world a better

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,839
place and a great community to belong

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,279
belong to but as i said no one way is

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,680
the apache way

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,880
and yet another uh the apache way

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,480
presentation

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,720
would be a good way to refer to any

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,120
apache wave presentation

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,560
so with the resilience though we are

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,120
what we call self-correcting

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,800
um the big thing is is that uh you know

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,560
danny angus put it very well we kind of

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,079
make things up as we go along

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,000
part of that is because we're in

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,440
uncharted area you know when we started

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,240
working with what is known as open

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,440
source and

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,160
aslv and uh the v1 and b2 licensed and

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,240
whatnot

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,600
uh it wasn't like everybody else had

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,320
been doing this we had to figure out how

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,680
to do it

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,920
when we wanted to figure out how to make

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,720
communities work and have our governance

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,200
apply

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,480
to those other projects and make this

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,399
scale and grow

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,399
so that we could have what is now

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,120
closing in on 800 numbers

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,079
uh and 8 000 committers and nearly 400

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,600
projects

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,000
we had to figure it out as we went along

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,000
there wasn't a good model to do this

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,760
and oftentimes i tell the story that you

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,279
know in 1998

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,800
i was working with a publicly traded

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,360
company that wanted to spend millions of

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,560
dollars

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,600
on sun uh solaris at the time and uh

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,079
oracle database

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,640
and i convinced them to go with uh what

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,680
is now

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,320
centos and a product called

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,120
mysql different mysql is not an apache

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,880
project but

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,200
uh to go with an open source solution

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,560
and that was a knockdown drag-out fight

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,720
for multiple months

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,800
that wouldn't even occur today people

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,440
understand that open source can mean

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,040
high quality software uh and it can

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,680
really solve a lot of really

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,800
amazing problems uh but the next thing

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,880
after resiliency

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,160
is really the charity you know we're a

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,000
dedicated organization

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,680
we're made up of members that are really

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,240
interested in making the world a better

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,560
place

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,399
and we do that by producing software at

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,920
no charge for the public good

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,600
and as i mentioned earlier the public

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,040
includes people it includes companies

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,200
includes nation states

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,800
whatever we produce that code so the

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,560
world can be a better place

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,000
with free software with code that's out

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,200
there that you can download that you can

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,040
make changes to

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,880
that you can contribute back if you want

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,519
or not contribute back if you want

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,399
we give it away freely and uh with no

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,279
quid pro quo

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,480
no no requirement that you give back to

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,800
us

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,079
additionally uh you know community is

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,360
really important to us

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,600
you know there's a statement we have

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,440
which is communities over code

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,680
what that really means is it comes down

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,600
to kind of a technology standpoint

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,880
if you are you know familiar with

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,320
technology and you're thinking about

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,000
backups and you have code

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,880
and something happens and you lose all

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,639
that code at apache that would be bad

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,160
but we wouldn't consider it really bad

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,200
because we still in the community that

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,320
wrote that code

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,000
and they can probably band together and

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,120
and cobble together the code and write

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,320
it better than it was done the first

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,720
time to begin with

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,000
so the community to us is significantly

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,000
more important than the code

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,040
like i said backups get lost we lose the

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,920
code no big deal

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,399
we lose the community that's devastating

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,399
and

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,639
you know companies uh internet companies

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,760
projects go through life cycles uh you

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,480
know i'll talk about this a little bit

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,320
more but

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,760
those life cycles include the fact that

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,279
you know one day that software

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,880
might be the hottest thing used by

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,399
everybody on the planet and

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,240
a couple years later it might be used by

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,680
nobody and it goes into the attic

00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,440
but what we want to see is we want to

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,440
see that community uh

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,519
grow and go on to another project and

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,680
continue with the projects and

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,440
doing charity and continue making

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,120
projects that change the world

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,200
uh but additionally one of the things we

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,000
do with the community is we do support

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,560
minority

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,440
voices we try to build support rather

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,760
than rule

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,040
uh what that kind of uh the best way i

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,600
can describe that is

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,560
uh that that's people who have votes um

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,880
can actually veto

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,240
things uh with a single vote the goal

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,320
behind it is is that

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,440
if there's a veto done there's a problem

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,760
and you need to go back

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,200
and figure out why they're vetoing it

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,360
what you can do to make this uh

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,040
non-problematic how you can make it so

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,880
that there isn't an issue

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,040
because the whole goal here like i said

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,959
is not just to meet a timeline or

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,959
produce a product it's to build a

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,959
community and you build communities by

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,880
building consensus

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,120
what's often times one of my failings is

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,560
telegraphing uh intentions

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,399
uh especially over email so

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,839
a lot of the way we build that consensus

00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,639
that the apache is with our voting

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,040
process

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,079
uh it's a very neat process and in fact

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,079
if you ever see

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,760
uh somebody who's a apache software

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,519
foundation member or committer

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,959
you will often see them comment on

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,040
things with just plus one

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,240
so plus none just means hey i like that

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,800
that's awesome i

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,120
i give my support behind that a zero is

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,199
a neutral and a negative one is a veto

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,279
uh so often times we do things by lazy

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,639
consensus if it's a non-controversial so

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,120
if you were doing something you'd say

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,399
hey

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,160
if anybody has a problem let me know

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,279
within 72 hours and i'll otherwise i'm

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,120
going to do this

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,720
but otherwise you should give a 72 hour

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,079
because we are a volunteer

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,079
led organization and all of our

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,959
committers are volunteers uh they might

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,279
be paid by the

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,800
organizations they work for but other

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,000
than that as far as the apache software

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,600
foundation is concerned they're

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,720
individuals who are members

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,720
we need to to be cognizant of that so

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,480
weekends and holidays and people just uh

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,440
you know not working on it constantly is

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,720
a part of

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,880
our culture part of our community and

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,079
uh what's very important important to us

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,120
is that uh

00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:01,440
consensus is not always equal to

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,279
unanimity uh what that basically means

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,720
is that sometimes you just have to come

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,839
to a consensus that you're not going to

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,760
be unanimous

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,880
uh at the apache spam assassin project

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,079
for example

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,800
one of the things that we did is we

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,959
developed a plug-in concept and so

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,240
certain things that we may not have 100

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,320
unanimity on

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,360
are pushed to being a plug-in and that

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,800
way it has to be

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,959
uh enabled by somebody manually

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,639
to turn on that plug-in etc it doesn't

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,920
change the core project

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,160
those are ways that you can build

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,399
consensus and not necessarily

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,759
upset people with a lack of unanimity

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,839
but yet still have

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,199
the community be solid and support the

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,440
projects

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,120
so additionally meritocracy we've talked

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,560
about this a number of times and so

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,399
power if you will is earned through

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,759
merit you know you don't really get a

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,279
vote until you've

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,880
shown that you know how to do things and

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,959
you've contributed to the project

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,560
whether that be documentation or code or

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,399
just bug grooming

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,720
graphics you know i try and make sure

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,199
that i recognize people of all different

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,000
types of contributions to the project

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,639
uh not just those who code uh but those

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,680
who for

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,279
example answer user questions etc and

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,240
earn that merit earn that right to have

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,680
a vote on it

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,839
and we use a thing called a project

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,560
management committee for those who have

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,959
recognized merit on a project and uh you

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,800
know

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,639
for me one of the things i often say is

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,720
the most merit is earned by people who

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,279
have ideas and put those ideas into

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,120
action

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,480
you know lots of people have ideas but

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,480
very few people have to follow through

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,160
to make sure those ideas happen

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,160
so we have another thing which is not

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,480
very polite but it's just f and do it

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,399
jfdi you know if you have an idea you

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,440
think it's worth it put it forward

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,040
we have different things rtc ctr that

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,079
stands for review then commit or commit

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,600
then review

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,440
you can be in different modes but you

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,120
know a lot of times uh you know we're

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,480
here to experiment we don't necessarily

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,320
have a roadmap for what's going to be

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,519
the next cold thing and so

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,800
sometimes you have to put yourself out

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,000
there and just do it and see how it

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,720
works and build a

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,920
a concept and that is part of where you

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,360
earn merit

00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,120
and do it so that people will give you

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,800
that that little bit of rope when you

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,360
want to go out there and do something

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:07,199
that's a little unusual

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,720
additionally as i mentioned everybody at

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,720
apache is an individual

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,000
they don't represent their companies um

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,679
in fact i don't even really pay

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,959
attention to what companies people work

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,799
for on the pmc

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,000
to me that has no bearing on their vote

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,720
and shouldn't

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,880
that's not how we run but you know the

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,400
biggest problem with any meritocracy

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,079
which i do think works very well at the

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,679
apache software foundation

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,360
is that there's a risk of turning it

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,280
into a dictatorship

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,679
we try to make sure that doesn't happen

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,280
we have friendly phrases for it like a

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,880
uh a beneficial dictator for life bdfl

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,559
um you know look at those kind of issues

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,600
look if somebody is getting too much

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,160
merit

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,760
and look at maybe rotating your chair

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,919
chair doesn't really have much power

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,440
they just report to the board um but it

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,280
can help to spread that around make sure

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,880
the project is community a project's

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,280
community is healthy

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,799
and uh you know people aren't just uh

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,160
railroading things through that's not

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:02,240
the way you're gonna build

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,240
a healthy long-standing community

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,000
additionally as a group of engineers um

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,440
some people will say we're overly

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,120
transparent i don't really know that

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,720
that's a possible thing

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,480
but we do have some rules around

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,919
transparency so the first thing is that

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,720
if it didn't happen on list it didn't

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,320
happen

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,919
what we like to do is we like to have

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,600
discussions we like to have decisions

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,360
and we like to have those archived

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,200
the reason that is is that anybody can

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,720
join at any time they can go back they

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,120
can look at the archives they can see

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,039
the reasoning behind things

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,799
if you have uh meetings there should be

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,640
contemporaneous notes brought back to

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,080
the list about those meetings because

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,679
sometimes a meeting or a phone call or

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,280
something happens at like apache con you

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,799
have a meeting with the group

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,720
but the point is you want to build that

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,600
community you want to build it in a way

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,640
that is pro volunteer that it's pro uh

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,919
the entire

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,440
globe and that the information is there

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,160
and supports what we call reversible

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,320
baby steps so with that we'd rather see

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,320
small baby steps rather than

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,600
some big huge step that may or may not

00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,520
break things um

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,880
you know it's it's a it's a judgment

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,720
call when that happens but

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,919
reversible baby steps is a lot about how

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,120
we do it and we do it with that

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,640
transparency so

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,400
if something doesn't work out we can

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,480
backtrack from it and uh

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,919
you know revisit because as i said a lot

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,720
of times we're doing things that nobody

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,280
has ever

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,039
done before all right before i go on too

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,400
much farther i just wanted to share a

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,799
quick story so

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,440
uh blues clues uh actually has a very

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,840
special

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,559
uh place in my heart uh for two reasons

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,559
first of all

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,640
um i really feel bad and have to

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,600
apologize 22 years later

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,000
uh to steve from blue's clues uh steve

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,039
is

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,440
a uh a canadian who really epitomizes

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,039
the

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,120
uh you know that just um very polite uh

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,200
canadian society where they apologize

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,039
for things they shouldn't apologize for

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,720
my favorite stories about blue's clues

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,200
revolve around two things so first of

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,039
all

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,360
when my wife and i had just been married

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,480
um i took her to e3 and introduced her

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,520
to geekdom

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,440
and e3 was the entertainment expo

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,720
and it was just huge it was chaos i

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,720
think the year i brought her there was

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,600
70 or 80 000 people there

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,200
and they had a nickelodeon booth and my

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,720
wife was very excited because she knew

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,400
nickelodeon she knew blue's clues

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,799
because she knew that her nephew

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,159
loved blue's clues so she walked over to

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,760
the blues clues booth where they were

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,360
doing pictures and she got kind of

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,000
frustrated after like five minutes that

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,159
this

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,840
one you know geek if she would refer to

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,440
it wouldn't get out of the chair so she

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,120
could take a picture with blue

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,200
so eventually she asked if he would get

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,000
out of the chair he apologized got out

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,200
of the chair

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,080
i have a photographic proof so this is a

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,760
picture of her

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,200
in the red chair with blue that's a

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,640
picture of me

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,440
22 years ago or so uh with uh blue as

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,880
well

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,080
and um this is from 1998 so this is may

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,440
of

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,200
may of 1998 may 21st remember correctly

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,720
we later found out when our kids were

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,360
born and started watching new

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,000
blues clues that uh she had kicked the

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,559
star of

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
the show uh steve out of his chair um

00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,840
and taken a picture with the stupid

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,360
puppet so we've always felt bad

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,360
so steve if you ever see this we

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,559
apologize uh that we kicked you out of

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,400
your chair

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,320
additionally because uh the second story

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,880
around blue's clues that i love is that

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,280
uh

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,880
my son was born highly affected by

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,360
autism he didn't speak for

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,679
many years uh the second time he ever

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,440
spoke was when we were

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,840
near we were walking through a shopping

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,240
center and the veterinarian's office was

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,640
there

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,480
and he ran up to the window and started

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,600
pointing to a big giant blue paw print

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,320
that was in the window and started

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,880
saying aku

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,720
aku which was his best attempt to say a

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,600
clue a clue so if anybody out there has

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,760
kids or

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,159
watch blues clues you now know so blues

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,240
clues that's my story all right

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,000
let me get back to the apache way all

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,320
right so the next thing we like to make

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,600
sure

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,679
at the apache way is that we're

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,480
pragmatic uh what we mean by that is we

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,799
like to have

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,679
visible and reusable code we'd like to

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,679
see projects

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,960
pulling code from other places not

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,679
reinventing the wheel

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,120
etc that visibility among projects the

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,720
ability to reuse codes

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,320
is just good programming practice but

00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,760
it's also just great for

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,360
making projects that come into the

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,640
incubator one of the questions that we

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,600
ask about with the incubator which we'll

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,480
talk about

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,919
is uh you know what are the projects at

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,960
the apache software foundation do they

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,559
use

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,640
uh additionally you know we do risk

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,880
mitigation so a lot of what we do with

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,559
with projects that come into the project

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,960
is we make sure they're isolated from

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:21,520
legal threats we make sure that the

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,840
ip provenance is is handled we make sure

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,120
that the licensing is done correctly

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,880
and things like that and that protects

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,000
both people who use the code as well as

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,080
the programmers

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,600
so uh we're not gonna you know let

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,400
problems happen and we're gonna protect

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,840
you

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,679
additionally and this is actually from a

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,760
sponsor which i loved um

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,440
but it lets you control your own destiny

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,159
so everything at the apache software

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,799
foundation

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,480
is uh never end of life you know every

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,159
project that we have is either in the

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,600
attic or available so you can download

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,440
it compile it and use it

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,960
doesn't matter if that's you know 20 30

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,640
50 years from now

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,960
i hope that our code is around for that

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,600
long and uh you know this has been a big

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,880
deal for

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,720
one of the customers for example was

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,559
telling me about how uh one of the

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,480
projects they used decided the end of

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,120
life they changed everything they didn't

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,640
like it

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,400
they ended up finding an apache software

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,559
project they

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,400
became a very large sponsor of ours

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,240
started contributing to that product

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,919
and uh basically that was a way of them

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,400
controlling their destiny making sure

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,240
that

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,400
you know a company that was external to

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,880
them didn't uh control what they wanted

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,880
to do

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,320
so open source software lets you do that

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,480
the apache way is big

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,919
about making sure you can do that we

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,159
already mentioned this no copyleft

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,240
principles and very pro-business

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,360
if you're ever unsure of what license to

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,799
start with

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,559
you really should just start with the

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,000
apache license if you

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,600
find out that's not the right solution

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,240
as drias puts here

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,760
previously with spam experts he recently

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,919
left

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,679
you can switch later to the gpl v3 but

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,360
going the other way around from the gnu

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,279
public license version 3

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,960
to the apache software license is very

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,279
very very difficult so

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,799
um you know by starting with the apache

00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,440
you can really start off on the right

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,440
foot

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,760
and really see about how that

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,080
transparency and all this apache way

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,120
can make for a successful project and

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,279
work in a business uh role as well

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,520
uh that pragmat uh pragmatic rule you

00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,600
know one of the things this came from a

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,440
company i worked at that was in the

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,559
startup world uh if you're in a merger

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,679
and acquisition and you're using

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,200
something with gpl

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,520
it can be a problem in the disclosure

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,799
stage um apache doesn't have those

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,600
problems so you can have

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:25,679
a pretty decent de-risking by using

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,679
apache software and apache software

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,440
license projects you don't have to be a

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,520
project inside the

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,200
umbrella to use our license our license

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,960
is available for anybody to apply to

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,919
their software and distribute how they

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,760
will

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,279
but you know it definitely helps if

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,559
you're in the commercial world if you're

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,520
in the merchants and acquisition running

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,520
a startup et cetera

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,080
another big thing with the apache way is

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,559
that we're vendor neutral as i mentioned

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,000
everybody who's here is all a um

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,440
representing their individual

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,360
um you know if you want to start a

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,320
company do it make billions off it you

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,559
owe us nothing

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,320
um and because of that you know as i

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,840
mentioned i don't pay attention or care

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,000
where people work that's not

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,360
that's not a bearing on when we vote it

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,360
doesn't have you know somebody can't say

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,960
that oh i work for xyz company

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,480
and we really need this feature now you

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,880
got to make a feature that gets voted on

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,240
that

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,559
people like or you got to reach

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,880
consensus or uh whatnot either through

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,640
unanimity or through non-unanimity

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,640
uh as i mentioned on spam assassin you

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,679
know we promote plug-ins so if we have a

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,720
controversial

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,480
um feature we make sure it's implemented

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,320
only enough plug-in and

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,520
that way people can be like okay it can

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,480
be enabled

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,000
uh you know uh by by uh you have to

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,320
enable it

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,760
manually and that makes it okay for the

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,080
rest of the group but they can go okay i

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,760
can

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,520
i can allow that through or be neutral

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,000
and not veto it um if they believe

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,120
strongly

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,279
on it additionally inclusion so

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,679
uh i'm very proud of the fact that uh we

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:52,320
have many people all walks of life

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,600
all socioeconomic backgrounds all around

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,159
the world etc

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,679
and so you know the thing i definitely

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,000
say is that merit is not

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,799
based on age sex religion sexual

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,600
preference

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,039
ethnicity um you know country of origin

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,480
physical cultural traits

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,320
it's one of the wonderful parts about

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,200
mailing lists and uh you know working

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,320
online is

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,320
you know people don't have to know

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,000
anything about you if you earn merit

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,520
by writing good code or being a good

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,559
netizen in the community

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,320
that's all that's needed so um and that

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,760
inclusion is very important as i talked

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,120
about it you know that's where we get

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,400
community over code

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,400
that's where we're working to fix our

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,000
diversity issues i mean your computer

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,440
industry has a problem with too many

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,080
people like me that are just

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,840
white older males and and you know that

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,520
doesn't bode well for the diversity so

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,760
we like to make sure we're trying to

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,840
promote diversity uh recently about a

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,600
year and a half maybe two years ago now

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,000
we started our diversity and inclusion

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,000
group um headed up by grizz does a

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,840
fabulous job uh getting people in there

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,600
and that's part of what we call the the

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,240
pipeline just getting people involved in

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,159
the projects

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,440
finding out what our issues are and

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,240
finding out how to make us more

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,080
inclusive

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,760
and all of that is to try and build

00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,159
stronger communities because

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,120
uh the communities really are much much

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,159
more important

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,000
than the code and i will leave you with

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,159
one final tip here before i go into my

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,520
last section i think i'm doing okay on

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,960
time um

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,880
and that's really just kind of applied

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,480
behavioral analysis um

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,240
what this basically does is you

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,000
reinforce the behavior you want to see

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,640
repeated so if you're ever training a

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,640
dog

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,320
you know you only reward the dog for

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,080
good behavior and you ignore the bad

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,919
behavior if you punish a dog

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,520
for bad behavior for example the dog

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,000
will become confused

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,799
and won't learn well so it's pretty well

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,399
uh

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,000
pretty well documented that positive

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:37,120
reinforcement works better

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,960
for training um towards that end there's

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,000
a wonderful guy tim freeman

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,720
uh wrote this concept that i read over

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,200
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,720
well over almost 25 years ago it looks

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,279
like 24 years

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,200
tim freeman wrote this thing it was

00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:52,799
dnftec do not feed the energy creature

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,640
and today that's what we would call

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,679
trolls or flame wars and it basically

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,279
just said you know

00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,720
if there's somebody just trolling just

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,720
ignore them whatever you can do

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,919
not feed them not reward that negative

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,480
behavior

00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,760
is going to be what brings uh it to the

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,520
the forefront so

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,120
i do encourage you go back and read that

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,880
original uh post

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,559
i thought it was very ahead of its time

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,520
before trolls and whatnot were really

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,880
known but

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,320
uh you know we used to have this problem

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,440
back in the bulletin board days that's

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,039
when this was written

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,720
and i think it applies just as well

00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,640
today on do not feed

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,000
the energy creature i just now happen to

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,080
know more about the science and the

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,640
psychology behind why it works

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,640
so all right the last section and this

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,360
is a pretty small section is just really

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,279
about

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,480
you know the apache software foundation

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,039
the apache way

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,520
and innovating open source software so

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,520
one of

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,799
the the key points that i wanted to

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,520
bring up again

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,960
so 386 is the current open source count

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,720
you can always get our account by going

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,200
to projects.apache.org

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,640
i also love showing off apache.org logos

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,240
so you can just see all the cool logos

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,240
that fall underneath

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,080
the apache software foundation

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,320
additionally we have 47 incubating

00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,279
podlings what that means is those are

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,960
projects that haven't

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,480
that are still learning the apache way

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,159
and they're still going through the

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,120
process of learning how to be underneath

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,039
our umbrella

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,559
and it can take anywhere from you know

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:11,360
let's say a year to

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,000
never to graduate out of the incubator i

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,840
am proud that

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,039
uh i'm working on mentoring and

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,120
championing i think

00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,200
uh about five projects one of them just

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,919
graduated so iotdb

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,600
just graduated as a top level project

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,120
that means they used to be a paddling

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,120
but now they're a project on their own

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,520
running their own controlling their own

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,279
destiny etc and voting as their pmc has

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,760
learned with the apache way

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,440
again from that bottom-up design the

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,760
apache incubator is where

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,120
they're taught that process it's a great

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,720
place to get involved if you want to

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,640
learn about new technology and

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,480
what's coming down the pipe and and what

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,000
might be the biggest thing uh years from

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,279
now

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,760
to get involved with the patching

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,039
creator you go to incubator.apache.org

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,039
um you know if you're interested in

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,440
being a project you there's

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,399
tons of wikis out there that have what

00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,679
you're doing you

00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,279
you want to try and bring a proposal

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,559
about your project and really what we

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,840
look for a lot of times is

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,360
what you're doing towards building a

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,799
community around that and how we can

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,640
help you build that community

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,399
we aren't just a repository of code as i

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,399
mentioned communities are more important

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,679
to us than code so we want to see at the

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,600
incubator how we can build your

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,480
community how we can make you stronger

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,880
how you can use the apache way to make a

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,000
really

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,679
really great project it is our entryway

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,720
into becoming part of the foundation's

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,000
effort especially if you have an

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,399
established product

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,200
um typically it needs to be licensed as

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,520
apache or

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,480
able to be licensed as apache we can

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,320
help answer

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,559
questions about how you might have to do

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,799
the re-licensing and whatnot

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,799
but basically all your any external

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:41,120
projects or any code donations

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:43,200
um enter the asf through the incubator

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,919
that's the formal process for it

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,720
um additionally it has uh two primary

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,080
goals uh

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,240
basically first of all make sure they

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,880
meet our legal standards as we mentioned

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,960
licensing able to make sure the risk is

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,080
mitigated things like ip providence are

00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,120
handled

00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,360
things that as well number two is that

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,960
we're able to develop a new community

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,120
you know what we want to see is as

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,279
people behind the project we don't care

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,960
what the project does you know you we're

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,480
not there to judge whether or not

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,080
we think it's a good project or a bad

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,679
project or whether it's

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,440
kind of a short lifetime or a long time

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,360
a lifetime what we care about is

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,200
is there a community behind this project

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,720
can it follow the apache way and can it

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,120
benefit from follow-up from

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,919
uh formal mentorship in the apache way

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,320
and if so

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,320
the more the merrier uh you know uh

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,320
merry band and misfits and whatnot so

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,000
you can visit the foundation and how it

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,640
works it's a great introduction or as i

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,039
mentioned before the

00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:38,000
incubator.apache.org

00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,760
has lots of great information and the

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,799
final slide

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:46,960
i wanted to excuse me the final slide i

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:48,480
wanted to leave you with

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,600
really brings us all together with you

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,480
know what is the apache software

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,399
foundation

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,399
about the apache way and the apache

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,919
incubator and about how

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,000
um i've really been able to innovate

00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,600
with open source software and doing so

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,120
with real companies with

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,559
the fact that you know i have to earn

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,919
money to pay for my kids to go to

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,200
college and put food on the table et

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,360
cetera

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,960
and you know at its core with open

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,120
source software is kind of this concept

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,519
of radical transparency so

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,880
uh over the years my company uses a lot

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,279
of things where we

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,039
uh do things like google docs because of

00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,559
the high level of collaboration where

00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,399
multiple people can work on say

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,159
the same thing and we try and make sure

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,279
that it's shared with as many people as

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,440
possible

00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,559
this type of radical transparency is

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,960
good because

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,480
um by sharing it both with the world we

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,000
can get other people who are

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,919
interested in moving the technology

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,120
forward we're able to get other ideas we

00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,640
might not have seen

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,480
and the number of times that people have

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,760
come up with ways to use software i've

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,640
developed that i never would have

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,360
envisioned

00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,640
has been just huge um so by promoting

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,960
radical transparency

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,679
sharing our ideas sharing our code

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,760
sharing

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,519
uh both internally as high as we can and

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:57,039
with the world as high as we can

00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:59,919
it has really helped us be monumentally

00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,919
successful additionally one of the

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,519
things that i can do an entire talk just

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,320
about this one point

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,640
is that at my firm we use a very good

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:11,360
conflict of interest policy

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,799
we promote open source and uh this is so

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,559
this is the paragon computer consultants

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,799
corporation and apache software

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,399
foundation that's open to link um but

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,440
you you'll notice what it does is it

00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,720
merges with the

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,399
uh the atf excuse me the asf and merges

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,200
with the apache way it talks about the

00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,880
fact that

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,480
you know for example you're allowed to

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,320
vote and um

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,919
your vote has no bearing on your

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,279
employment you know you're not

00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,720
going to be um stressed

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,080
about voting against something just

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,640
because it might benefit the company

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,000
you're

00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,159
a member of the asf as a individual etc

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,919
and these type of points are well

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,279
caveated here

00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,279
i don't know that it's perfect but we

00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,000
found it to be very good we found it to

00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,279
be

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,679
excellent for our customers to

00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,080
understand uh that we're willing to work

00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,760
on

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,840
open source projects and we're willing

00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,039
to do things and this is the conflict of

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,360
interest policy we

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,480
we follow uh when we're working with

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,880
that and how do we

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,720
maintain you know the as a you know that

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,480
conflict and do it well

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,720
with both the corporation and the

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,440
foundation uh so i do encourage

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,839
uh your organizations that you work with

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,119
to

00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:20,720
um have a good conflict of interest

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:24,079
disclosure policy and um

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:26,639
and whatnot so anyway

00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,119
uh i will say uh thank you after that

00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,480

events are up online but they will be

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,160
available

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,960
on youtube um the the the program that

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,880
we're doing

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,240
uh hope and does uh record everything

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,040
and it takes some post processing and

00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,400
whatnot but

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,920
