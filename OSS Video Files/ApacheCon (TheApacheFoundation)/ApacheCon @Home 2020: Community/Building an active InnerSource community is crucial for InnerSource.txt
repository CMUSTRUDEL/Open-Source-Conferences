	Building an active InnerSource community is crucial for InnerSource
Jerry Tan

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

InnerSource is the use of Apache Way within an organization. it needs both high-level support and internal engineers community support. Sometimes, high-level support is easy to get and implemented, but internal engineers' community support is much hard, it means culture shift. So building one active internal open source community is very important. As OSPO of Baidu, I adopt InnerSource inside Baidu for more than 4 years. I will talk about how I build the internal community in my company, including how I plan, how I implement it. I need to attract the target people, set small tasks to let them participate and contribute, and incentivize them. InnerSource is a long journey, but it is worth the investment.

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,039
okay

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,399
let's get started

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,760
okay let's begin hello everyone welcome

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,559
to messaging

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,520
the topic is building an active inner

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:45,760
source

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:48,079
community is crucial for inner source

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,039
first let me introduce myself a little

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,800
bit

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:55,199
my name is name is

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,719
jerry so you can call me jeritan i'm

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,440
from china

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,559
i have more than 20 years experience

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,840
with open source

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,799
software and open source community i'm a

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,600
community of

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,200
bozella glom and apache software

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,760
foundation

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,439
i was a former open source leader of

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,479
baidu company

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,520
i'm also an advocator of inner source in

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,320
china

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,960
i'm an organizer of inner source child

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,960
working group

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,880
here's my agenda first i'll talk about

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,799
what is inner source and an inverse

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,920
community

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,840
then i'll talk about why we need to

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:41,200
do one then how to build

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,520
and how to measure then

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,399
i'll talk about my practices in science

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,680
i do

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:51,360
include the community user model plan

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,360
practices and results

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,840
summary and questions

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,360
so what is inner source

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,079
inner source is the use of open source

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,040
software

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,319
development the best practices and the

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,560
establishment of

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,560
an open source like cultural visit

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,360
organizations

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,319
the organizations may still develop

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,520
temporary

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:23,599
software but internally opens up

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,720
its development this definition

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:29,280
is from wikipedia it's a little

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,280
complicated

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,920
in short inner source is absorbing the

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,920
opposite way

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:41,360
inside an organization this is much

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,720
easier to understand this definition is

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,720
given by dennis cooper

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:52,319
the open source deva

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:55,360
who made inner source very popular

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,360
in recent years

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,360
so what is the inner source community

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,800
industrial community is one type of user

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,840
community

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,440
it's inside an organization

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,480
most of the members are engineers plus

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,000
employees from legal strategy

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:21,280
and hr departments they share

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,400
the same value of inner source

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,400
the apache way

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,959
i know error apache guys

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,640
may have a different understanding of

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,480
the apache way

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:41,280
here is my understanding of the apache

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:44,319
apache way including the mission

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,400
provides software for the public good

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:51,360
the core value community overcome

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,640
principles collaborative software

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,879
development

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,840
and commercially friendly standard

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,040
license

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,439
and so on and it also has private

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,280
premises and conventions

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:08,560
such as using mail list and the voting

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:12,720
when needed it's

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:16,160
a whole function of

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,680
mission venue principles and the best

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,799
practices

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,240
but for me the most

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:29,040
why inner source falls apart because

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:33,600
they believe with the core value

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:36,960
of the open source

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,400
can make it happen making it successful

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,880
that is committee over code we need to

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,880
make it

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,919
open we need to make anything

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,520
transparent

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:50,800
and we need collaborate to make

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,800
a inner source

00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:02,639
so why inner source is important

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:06,160
here's one model of ignorance model

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:09,440
to make it successful we need both

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:14,080
exact support from the top down

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,080
and the internal community both are

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:21,199
both are needed sometimes

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,560
executive support is easy to get

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:28,240
but internal community support is much

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:32,320
harder why because

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:35,440
it means culture shift cutter shift

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,440
is never easy

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:44,479
so why we need it very much

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,600
why i said and actually community

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,880
resource community is

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,080
crucial because we need

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:56,800
an atmosphere to emphasize everything

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:59,680
that open source is important

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,800
we need a community to let internal

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,479
developers

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:08,240
to fund their users their contributors

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,280
their partners we also need the

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,560
community

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:17,919
to let contributors to feel respected

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,919
and belongs to recognize their merits

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,360
here is the needs of inner source

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,639
community users

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,160
i use the graph of msnos hierarchy of

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,840
needs

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,400
it divides people's needs into five

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,080
layers

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:41,280
here is the third layer of

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,560
at least belonging and

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:48,080
lovely did so we need to

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:51,840
make our inner source users feel that

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:55,759
they belong to this community

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,400
for the level 2 we need to make them

00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,440
feel that

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:03,199
they are respected in this community

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:06,000
and for the first learnings

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,639
the contributors contribution need to

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,759
get

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,880
recognized so they think

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,000
their values have been

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,000
success successfully self-fail

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
self-fulfilled

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:27,440
so how to judge if

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,639
an inner source community is active

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:35,199
it's very many very easy

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:38,319
it needs to strip many people

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,080
from directors from vp to normal

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:44,400
engineers

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:49,599
from engineers from hr

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:53,520
from qe from product manager

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:58,319
many kinds of laws

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,319
second many is many interactions

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:11,360
the third method is medic contributions

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:16,800
patches issues documentation

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,800
tests and feedbacks are all welcomed

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,199
so how to build an active inner source

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:26,240
community

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,680
please remember it's one type of

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:33,279
user community but it has its own

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:36,560
characteristics the euros

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:40,880
come from the same company so the

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:43,919
reputation is very important

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,200
the targets of

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:50,720
industry community is not for revenue

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:54,320
because you cannot make money from

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,360
internal employees instead

00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,760
is for your contributions

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,760
to help immerse those practice in the

00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,760
organizations

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,680
here is the model of aar

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,160
models we need to adapt it

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,800
a little bit within inner source

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,800
community

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:24,640
the first aid is acquisitions

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:28,000
it means how do us fund you

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:32,480
in in-house community we need to turn

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,399
normal employees into inner source

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:40,000
users the second a is

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:43,440
activations it means do users

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,120
have a general first experience

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:52,880
in immersion community it means let the

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,880
users participate in all kinds of events

00:09:53,040 --> 00:10:01,760
this the r is the retentions

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,959
means do users use it subsequently

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,640
in inverse community we need to provide

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:11,360
the industrial users fresh contents

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,360
and tasks

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:20,399
this second area is

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:23,360
revenue how do we make money

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,959
but in in-house community we don't make

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,240
money

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:31,839
we need to incentive

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,640
industries community guys to contribute

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,399
more

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,399
to our inner source projects

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:43,920
and the last is referral do

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:47,120
users tell others in english community

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,720
we encourage the users

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:54,160
to sh to influence

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:58,839
more people to contribute here

00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:01,600
is the whole model in industrial

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,800
community

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,680
the operational task is the same

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,880
we need content operations event

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,839
operations

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,839
and the user operations they need to be

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:21,760
combined combined together

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,760
to make operations successfully

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,880
okay let me talk about

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:34,079
by those inner source journey baidu

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,519
is the largest largest search engine in

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,800
china

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:43,839
support some people missing is

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,839
chinese google it has more than

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:51,120
10 000 engineers from

00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:54,839
2016 it adopted inner source

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,760
to improve their internal technical

00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:01,279
platforms

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,279
here's the schedules

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,279
first it

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,079
began its first open inner source

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,839
project

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:17,200
for the pilot project then i began to

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:20,639
build the inner source community for

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:26,880
only one project then

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,880
we adapted to the whole department

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:34,880
it means it has three so

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:37,920
300 engineers and my projects

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,959
are accelerated to build more and the

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,440
bigger communities

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,880
then inner source is adapting to the

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,399
whole company

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:54,399
i need to make the community more bigger

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:54,399
and rich and climax

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,000
here is the euromodal analysis and tasks

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,519
i made

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,880
for my inner source journey

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:10,639
i divided my people into

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:14,399
five layers number five

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:17,600
all employees volume five

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,639
the operation is acquisition i send

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:24,160
out regular emails with training and

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:27,600
even related and need to

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:30,000
turn them into inner source community

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,000
users

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:38,079
level 4 is inside the

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,800
committee i need to activation them

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,519
and the rotation zone so i organize

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,320
events

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,519
with no entry and i'll organize

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,680
technical trainings

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:52,639
and bootcamps the third layer is

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,639
active users

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,720
the discussion they are communicating

00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,920
they

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,199
collaborate in the community so for

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,480
livestreaming

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:07,600
i intensive contributions

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,040
i own as inner source contest and

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:14,800
hypernet

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,800
to let this active user to contribute

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,920
more

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,600
the number two is contributors for their

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,560
truth

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,519
and incentive referral prs for

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,360
individuals

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,839
and the building stars and the top layer

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,720
is opision leaders

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,800
these opinion leaders have a great

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,440
influence inside the company

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:44,480
they can influence many

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:49,120
engineers to contribute so

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:52,560
for level one i enlarge their influence

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:55,760
i give them many opportunities

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:59,199
for our inner source i

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:03,040
will encourage them to participate

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:06,160
in many events such as kong

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:12,160
kong or meet with

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:15,360
famous guys such as indus tours

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,680
my principles since i'm

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,480
building inner source community so i

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,600
need to

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,800
undoubtedly inner source ways to build

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,480
it

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:29,120
so i follow the same core values

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,480
the operation needs to be open

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,519
transparent

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:37,120
and collaborated and also i

i need to take part in

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:48,800
it means i need to be one member of the

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,800

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:58,079
here is the details of the action plan

00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:02,079

computation

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:10,720
for developers it has been

it's either one night event

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,400
with a sound test

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,360
engineers will come in and to finish

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,840
this

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:53,679
their output can be used by all

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,720
engineers when they're done they have a

00:19:53,679 --> 00:20:00,400

no threshold and high participation

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,720
such a citizen slogan

share t-shirt

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:34,559
here's one case so deciding snogma

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,480
slogan is important it's easy to

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,760
remember

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,480
as soon as i spoken it's easy to let the

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,360
user

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,360
to participate

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,039
i organized this event last for one

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,159
month

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,440
first we allowed it to satisfy this

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,120
token

00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:02,640
then we got over 100

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:05,360
options then we were for the top ten

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,720
the top ten winners came asked for

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,000
themselves and then

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:13,760
the community was again then

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,840
the last winter came out the whole event

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,840
last for one month and

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,679
one thousand users participate is very

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,679
popular

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:31,520
here is the result slogan tells us look

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,440
because of open source we made it

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:38,880
simple here's a reason

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:42,000
why we wonder because

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:46,880
it was related with by those value

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:51,280
by those value is simple and reliable

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:54,559
so connected with the core value

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:58,880
will make the people easy to remember

00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:02,080
and easy to understand second reading is

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,799
because code is open we can

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,760
work on the same code base so

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,640
collaboration

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,640
is so simple

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,799
so unless we choose this token

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,200
because our open source we make it

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,200
simple

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,200
it's very very

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,200
perfect

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,520
here is the anarchist kubernetes boot

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,159
camp

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,600
because engineers is interested in

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,039
correlating

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:40,400
hoping to get started very quickly

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:42,559
so i organized this kubernetes bootcamp

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,840
for beginners

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,840
i made it outlast

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,280
started to recruit the volunteer

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,559
internally

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,559
because i cannot

00:22:52,799 --> 00:23:01,039
give this course all by myself

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,559
i need volunteers finally

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:08,480
we got seven volunteers to train our

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:12,159
engineers these valentines are great

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,120
they write the papers they prepare the

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,720
course

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:20,400
and the right scripts and then

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:23,280
give speech the course

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,640
contents and screens are all inner

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,760

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:31,840
we got many contributions from our

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:35,760
students we organized

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:40,640
10 more training courses all

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:45,039
got very high comfort certifications

the community all loves this course

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:51,840
it becomes our branding course

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:30,480
open source and we also

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:34,080

is still not good courage is not enough

00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:02,799
i plan to cover uh

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:04,320
50 percent but the digital original

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,960
number

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,360

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,360
enough

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,960
