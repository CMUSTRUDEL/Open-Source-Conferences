Apache Pulsar is an open-source distributed pub-sub messaging system originally created at Yahoo and now part of the Apache Software Foundation(ASF). It is a multi-tenant, high-performance solution for server-to-server messaging. After graduation from ASF, the community grows bigger and stronger, with more and more users and contributors. This presentation shares how Apache Pulsar develops a borderless community in a short period.

Jennifer Huang is an Apache Pulsar committer and a senior technical writer at StreamNative. She contributes to Apache Pulsar documentation and community development proactively. She is dedicated to growing the Apache Pulsar community globally.
