	A view from the ivory tower: Participating in Apache as a member of academia
Michael Mior

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

Academics in an ivory tower conjures images of people toiling away nicely insulated from many of the concerns of reality. While this has it's advantages, anyone who's tried to use a project written for a research paper under a deadline can attest that it doesn't always result in useful code. While completing my PhD, I found an Apache project that fit well with the work I was doing s I rolled up my sleeves to write some code to make it more useful for solving my own problems. I've since had the opportunity to join the project's PMC and now as a faculty member, I continue to find value in encouraging my own students to contribute to Apache projects. I'll discuss how academics and Apache projects can find mutual benefit in close collaboration.

Michael completed his Masters degree at the University of Toronto and received a PhD from the University of Waterloo. While completing his PhD, he began contributing to the Apache Calcite project and has since joined the Calcite PMC. He joined RIT as an Assistant Professor in 2018. His research revolves around schema design and management and data integration for non-relational data. He continues to look for opportunity for himself and his students to contribute to Apache projects.

[Music]

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,560
um

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,119
so my name is uh is michael muyor i'm

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,040
currently a a faculty member

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,440
at the rochester institute of technology

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,160
here in rochester new york

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,360
and i'm going to be talking about how i

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,800
got involved

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,800
in asf projects and how

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,399
you might be able to as well and how

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,960
this is interesting from the perspective

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,680
of

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,039
uh both people who are our academics and

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,360
people in industry

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,280
and how we can work together in

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,920
meaningful ways

00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,000
i feel a bit at this point like one of

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,800
our our keynotes from uh

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,320
from edmond uh this morning maybe uh

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,799
cannibalized a few things i was

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,880
i was going to say um and i'll mention

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,640
some of the uh the work that uh that

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,240
i've done with with edmond and how he's

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,520
been uh been really helpful to uh to

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,000
some of the projects that we're working

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,960
on

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,920
uh so i'm gonna cover some uh similar

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,520
things to

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,200
what uh edmund's doing but you know what

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,200
he was talking about this morning was uh

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,400
was great example of some of the things

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,479
that uh that i'll be discussing

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,799
right so i'm just going to start off

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:34,640
just brief introduction to myself

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,159
how i got involved in the in the asf

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,799
and then a little bit about the the

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,680
apache way and how that sort of connects

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,280
with how

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,960
we tend to to operate as academics

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,200
then i want to give a few examples of

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,040
some some success stories of

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,560
you know asf and collaboration with

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,600
academia and

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:58,079
finally ending with how others can also

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,360
get involved so first of all my uh my

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,360
background

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,759
i i started off my education

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,959
in a in 2009 with an undergraduate

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,039
degree in computing science at what was

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,560
known as the university of ontario

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,920
institute of technology

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,599
is now known as ontario tech university

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,319
i did a master's degree in computer

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,720
science at the university of toronto

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,599
immediately after i joined a startup

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,520
called

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,040
bunch which i'm going to assume no one

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,200
has uh has ever heard of

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,400
uh which will you know lead you to

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,760
understand how

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,519
how that turned out uh it was a really

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,599
fun job you know working

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,040
a lot more hours than i would have liked

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,920
getting paid a lot less than i that i

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,400
would have liked but

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,640
it was just a really uh really great

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,400
time there

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,319
and then we took a leave from that to uh

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,200
start a phd in computer science at the

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,959
university of

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:58,319
waterloo a few years later while i was

00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,800
a phd student i joined the apache

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,840
calcite project

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,239
and then a couple years later graduated

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,360
that phd program and as i mentioned

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,239
earlier now i'm at the

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,040
the rochester institute of technology

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,120
and still

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,120
working with asf projects

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,200
so for me personally the sorts of of

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,080
things i work on and

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,480
what gets you up in the morning my

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,200
research is the primary part of my job

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,680
here

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,120
so my research is is focused around

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,400
nosql

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,040
database design and integration looking

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,879
at

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,519
connecting a bunch of different data

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,760
sources data in different formats

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,560
uh doing distributed analysis of this

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,480
data and

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,480
moving uh you know interesting sources

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,040
like open data

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,159
and also work with uh with schema

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,239
discovery

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,239
uh for semi-structured data

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,959
so this brings me to how how i ended up

00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,000
getting involved with uh

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:04,879
apache and the uh the asf

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,879
so while i was my

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,640
heterogeneous processing seeing what

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,560
existing research work there was

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,680
as well as what was out there that i

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,320
might be able to

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,280
leverage for my own uses and that's when

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,960
i happened to

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,360
come across the apache calcite project

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,320
which is a data processing framework

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,080
that operates

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,199
over heterogeneous data sources i'll

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,800
i'll talk a little bit more about

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,280
calcite in a moment

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,720
uh but i ended up contributing an

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,840
adapter for

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,400
uh apache cassandra to work with uh

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,800
site and also ended up making some uh

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,880
some contributions to uh to apache spark

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,199
through all this

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,280
uh so calcite for those who aren't

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,160
familiar with this specific project

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,560
um it's a data management framework that

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,280
does

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,960
sql query parsing and optimization and

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,560
actually forms a lot of the the basis

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,080
for query optimization

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,120
uh in apache hive and drill

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,600
we see it used by a lot of uh different

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,600
industry alibaba uber and tencent uh

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,080
we've got committers in the project from

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,600
some of those organizations uh and

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,560
calcite also

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,880
connects to a number of different data

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,000
sources including a few other apache

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,800
projects such as

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,919
cassandra and spark a little bit of the

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,520
background on

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,919
calcite itself so calcite

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,880
was originally entering the incubator in

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,320
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:39,600
as optic uh was then renamed calcite

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,160
uh a year later first version of uh

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,520
calcite non-uh beta released graduating

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,240
from the incubator

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,120
uh the following year i joined as a

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,240
committer

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,000
after my initial uh contributions to uh

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,639
to calcite

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,039
and then about a year later i i joined

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,319
the

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,759
the pmc and started a term as the uh the

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,759
pmc chair

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,360
uh i say term because in the in the

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,240
calcite project we

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,960
made the decision to have a new pmc

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,960
chair

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,360
um every year so that responsibility has

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,440
been uh been rotating around

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,280
but what was really interesting uh for

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,319
me and relevant

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,759
to uh to how i engage with uh with

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,919
calcite now

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,360
in 2018 uh some committers on the apache

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:29,440
calcite project

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,360
uh published a a paper uh in acm sigmod

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,840
which is a computer science database

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,360
conference uh

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:39,680
that'll get into uh to more later

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,360
so i mentioned some of my uh

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,840
contributions before

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,400
you know wrote this uh adapter and some

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,400
other

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,800
improvements to uh calcite as well as

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,680
some minor improvements to apache spark

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,880
and some other uh

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,520
products i've worked on and

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,800
i really didn't know what to uh expect

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,840
when i was uh first

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,800
trying to uh to contribute to apache

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,280
calcite

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,720
so this is a comment that i i snagged

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,759
from jira

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,919
uh after i opened my uh my first jira

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,840
case for the uh the cassandra adapter

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,400
that i implemented uh and i also just

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,520
wanted to to take a moment to uh

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,160
give some thanks to uh to julian hyde

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,319
who

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,560
is one of the original creators of the

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,280
uh the calcite project and still

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,599
uh very heavily involved uh despite that

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,680
uh i believe not being a part of his uh

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,199
his day job anymore working with with

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,160
calcite

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,240
and the response that uh that i had from

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,639
the uh the community and engaging with

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,520
with people in the calsight project has

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,319
just been

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,360
uh really great i think for those uh

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,720
approaching from

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,919
the outside into an asf project

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,960
i think generally you will likely find

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:57,520
that those in the in the project

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,000
may be a lot more more welcoming and

00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,759
accepting

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,199
of of contributions than uh than you

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,160
might see elsewhere uh that was

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,280
certainly

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,720
the uh the case for uh for me with uh

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,360
with calcite

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,520
um within a few months of that uh

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,360
original uh commit landing

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:19,120
uh i got the commit bit on uh on calcite

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:22,400
uh and then about a year after that

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,199
was uh invited to uh to join the pmc uh

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,000
and still

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,639
now i've been uh regularly contributing

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,080
to

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,560
calcite so

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,839
now here's an important aspect of i

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,479
think how

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,880
those working with the the asf and those

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,519
uh

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,399
in in academia can work together i think

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,039
a lot of the

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,000
the same principles that underlie the

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,760
asf

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,839
are also very well applicable to those

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,399
in academia so

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,800
i'm sure many many of you here are

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,519
familiar with the uh the apache way

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,839
i am going to uh to go through some of

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,040
the uh the key tenets of the uh of the

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,000
apache way

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,360
um and then just do some comparing and

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,320
contrasting for

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,279
how we tend to uh to work as a as as

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,959
academics

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:18,160
so give a few points on each of these

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:20,720
relevant to the asf and then also

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,120
how i find they're they're particularly

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,800
relevant to me and academia

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:29,440
and how apache and

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,399
academia tend to to share a lot of the

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,560
the same values

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,760
so one of the the first uh tenets of the

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,680
the apache way

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,360
is is earned authority this idea that

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,040
everyone can participate

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,279
and your your influence in a project is

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,600
based on the merit that you earn

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,080
and i've found you know in academia the

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,880
the most productive research labs

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,360
tend to have a lot of diversity in terms

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,360
of the

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,880
the types of of students they're

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,560
recruiting the

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,920
level of those uh those students in

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,480
their education

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,680
i've seen many places that have

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,680
incredibly productive

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,120
undergraduate students and all the way

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:10,480
up to phd students and of course faculty

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,640
making really meaningful contributions

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,600
so i think in both cases it's really

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,040
valued that

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,519
that anyone can can have a good idea and

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,040
those willing to uh to participate are

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,200
generally uh

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,680
should be given the opportunity to uh to

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,680
do so

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,880
the next tenet we'll look at is the idea

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,959
of a community of peers

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,959
so this idea that we're all contributing

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,680
as as individuals

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,880
in the asf and that our different uh

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,399
roles and titles

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,320
are considered equal and in academia

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,519
this is something that's generally quite

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,640
important as well

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:51,440
so for me i know that i

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,920
work with a lot of folks from uh from

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,360
different

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,079
institutions and different uh places

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,279
around the world at different levels and

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,120
even when it comes to

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,680
interacting with uh with students

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,560
especially uh graduate students

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,839
references to to treat uh graduate

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,959
students especially our

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,440
our phd students as junior colleagues uh

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,839
because that's uh that's what they are

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,040
now it's a it's it's true that in the

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,600
the context

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,040
of my relationship with my students in

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,760
in my day job there is

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,959
some level of of authority i have over

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,839
those students but

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,880
at the same time uh it's great to see

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,360
students who

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,079
really have great ideas who are willing

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,120
to

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:37,360
even uh challenge my own ideas to

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,040
push things in a new direction so i

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,440
think this is another aspect

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:47,440
of where both of these communities value

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,760
this free exchange of information here

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,480
which brings us to the the next tenet

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,560
here

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,880
of open communications so this idea that

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,800
any communication in an asf project

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,560
should be publicly accessible

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,160
all decisions should be should be made

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,519
publicly

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,000
now in academia actually this is uh

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,800
not always as true as i would like it to

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,240
be

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:15,279
especially in the case of source code

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,320
that gets uh published as a that it

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:21,279
exists as a byproduct of an academic

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,480
publication uh unfortunately often cases

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,839
uh source code is

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,839
is not made public uh but i think we are

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,160
starting to uh to see that change

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,320
however certainly uh publication uh as

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,959
an academic is uh is critical

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,160
uh and in some cases maybe more than uh

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,000
than it should be

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,240
but this open dissemination of

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,240
information is certainly uh critical to

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,240
to what we do as as academics

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,480
and the next tenet here of consensus

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,639
decision making

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,240
this is certainly something that we to

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,800
see across

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,839
academia as well so like in the uh the

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,480
asf

00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,680
seeing votes equal regardless of

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,880
position

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,360
uh although again in my day job

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,320
there certainly are people who uh who

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,720
have

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,720
authority over me you know i i do have

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,200
my my department chair who is my boss he

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,680
has

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,279
he has his boss and uh and so on uh

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,680
however in terms of uh

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,800
of governance and and voting uh

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,519
generally

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,959
faculty members in academia are

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,600
considered to

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,120
ideally have an equal representation

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,040
when we're trying to uh to make these

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,680
decisions and progress forward as an

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,920
institution

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,600
so i think this is another value that's

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,800
uh that's commonly shared between the

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,959
the asf and academics

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,199
uh the next uh tenant here of

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,519
responsible oversight

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,800
so for asf projects of course you know

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,320
self-governing and

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:51,040
commits are peer-reviewed uh now

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,440
this tends to be true to a similar

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,440
degree in academia as well that

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,680
different research labs tend to be

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,079
fairly independent

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,240
i know i've been uh you know asked

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,720
several times by uh by family members

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,880
who are who are not academics like well

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,720
so so who looks at all the uh the

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,199
research that you're doing and uh

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,199
who keeps track of where you're going

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,880
and the reality is for for most research

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,279
labs where we're operating

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,079
uh independently which is also the case

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,199
with

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:23,040
myself and my students where the the

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,600
oversight comes in is

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,320
the peer review process in in academia

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,199
when we

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,600
go towards a publication so we can think

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,000
of this

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,720
as being a bit of a mayor for the uh the

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
peer review

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,199
process of of commits uh to apache

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,560
projects

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:43,839
unfortunately uh from the code side

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,560
it's often not the case where where code

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,199
written for

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,720
for academic projects is peer reviewed

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,000
and that's something i'll likely come

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,600
back to

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,279
uh but certainly we could we could

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,279
benefit from uh from more of that

00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,000
another uh tenant the asf this idea of

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,399
independence

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,120
so of course the the asf you know vendor

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,360
neutral with

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,199
with no one having special privileges i

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,160
think academics generally

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,600
value that very much as well although it

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,800
is certainly true as it

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,519
you know can be uh if not intentionally

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,760
times elsewhere uh that in some cases

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,560
there are uh you know institutions with

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,959
uh with

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,839
larger budgets and clout that that do

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,680
maybe uh

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,880
you know have a bit of a bigger say in

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,279
some cases but

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,839
i think this is a principle that we we

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:35,279
generally all value as well

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:38,800
um and finally this uh this idea of

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,480
of community over code uh or in uh in my

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,519
case you know community

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,320
over uh publications uh i think is is so

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,519
important

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,199
uh i've seen many labs and many of my my

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,920
fellow students when i was in in grad

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,040
school

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,680
uh get really hit hard by by burnout

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,839
from

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,199
really just uh trying to uh to push

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,600
themselves beyond

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,959
what's healthy and i think it is it is

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,040
really important that we

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,639
take the time to uh to nurture the

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,600
communities that we have

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,000
uh whether within the asf it is the uh

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,959
the group

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,360
of of committers and and pmc members um

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,680
or

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,720
in my case the uh the students who are

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,680
working with me

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,120
uh in my lab and i think once we have a

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,839
healthy community there

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,839
we end up all being much more productive

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,839
okay so next i wanted to talk a little

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,199
bit about

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:34,880
some success stories that i've seen

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:38,079
in terms of the collaboration between

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,240
academia and apache projects now for

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,560
those of you again who uh who caught

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,600
edmund's uh keynote this morning uh

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,920
certainly the

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,800
the work that uh that he's doing uh over

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,920
in oak ridge

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,440
uh is a great example of some cases

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,600
where

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,920
academic researchers can have great

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,959
partnerships with uh

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:02,160
folks at the the asf

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,000
in terms of some specific projects okay

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,640
here's a just uh you know a few

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,640
that have kind of uh not necessarily uh

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,039
you know academic research labs in all

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,799
cases but uh but industry research labs

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:17,439
as well uh and we see some interesting

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,439
uh projects coming out from uh all sorts

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,240
of academic institutions

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,039
uh probably you know the most uh notable

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,760
here

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,160
being uh apache spark which uh of course

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,360
uh

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,320
was mentioned uh in the uh the keynote

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,039
this morning

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,440
uh as being a great example of a project

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,400
that

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,600
started in academia was adopted into the

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,240
uh the asf

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,400
uh and has also seen a lot of uh great

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,320
commercial uh success as well

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,440
uh but certainly you know projects like

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,280
uh like mesos

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:52,960
uh flink and and others have also

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:56,799
seen great success both within the asf

00:17:52,960 --> 00:18:00,720
and within the industry so

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:03,440
for spark of course sparks started as a

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,320
you know an academic project some of the

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,840
uh

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,080
papers on on spark have received

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,880
thousands of of citations covering

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,240
different aspects of apache spark

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,600
and has inspired hundreds uh if not uh

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,480
not thousands of

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,880
other related research papers either

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,840
making use of apache spark

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,000
trying to improve on on spark itself and

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,400
so on

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,760
uh now as far as uh you know the apache

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,880
calcite project

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:38,000
uh we have a bit more modest level of

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:41,679
of success on the the academic side

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,280
so we we started back in 2018 with uh

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:48,160
just a paper giving an overview of the

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,919
the technology within apache calcite uh

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,280
this was an effort that was

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:56,559
uh primarily spearheaded by by edmund uh

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,480
at oak ridge and we got overall a really

00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,600
great uh response from the uh the

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,600
community

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,760
uh we actually saw in in looking through

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,679
how calcite was uh was being used with

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,960
in academia and talking to uh some

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,679
different folks that

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,880
there were others besides myself who had

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,960
had independently

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,039
discovered calcite and we're making some

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,840
use of it uh and certainly we've seen

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:22,880
that continue to uh to happen over time

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,000
i think one of the the great things uh

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,320
for me about uh about

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,280
calcite was just having a great

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,480
foundation

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,960
of uh an existing project to build on

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,200
which

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,120
for me saved me a lot of time uh and

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,520
also gave me the opportunity to uh to

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,480
contribute back to this project

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,200
since then there was a another paper

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,120
published

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,799
last year at the the same conference

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,679
this was also

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,440
in collaboration with uh some folks from

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,640
apache flink

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,760
looking at streaming sql uh

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,559
both in in calcite and flink

00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,720
and one really uh great thing that we've

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,919
seen in the uh the calcite project

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,080
um was this uh this work here on on

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,440
automated reasoning of of database

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,640
queries

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,880
and this was by uh shumo chu he wrote

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,000
his

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,559
his phd thesis on on this topic

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,919
and developed a system called uh called

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,240
causette

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,840
so cause that was not uh primarily

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,840
focused around calcite

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,440
uh but for a bit of background what

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,960
cause that tries to do

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:32,720
uh is to prove uh equivalence between

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:36,080
different uh sql queries uh and

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,360
we found uh to our delight that uh the

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,840
cause that project

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,280
uh discovered calcite and they were able

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,799
to actually

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,520
formally uh prove for

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,080
many of calcite's uh rewrite rules for

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,640
sql

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,159
queries that those rewrite rules were

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,080
correct

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,919
so that's really great to see because of

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,200
course when we when we write

00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,240
tests we try to think of of edge cases

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,640
we try to

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,440
cover all uh possible bugs that we can

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,080
think of

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,200
uh and no matter how well we do uh with

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,080
that process

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,840
that's still a step removed from

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,240
formally proving correctness

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,159
uh so this was just a really a pleasure

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,240
to uh to see and some extra

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,640
validation of the uh the work that that

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,200
calcite folks had been doing

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,720
and a nice side effect this was that the

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,640
the test cases

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,440
that were provided by the calcite

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:33,360
project were also

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,679
useful to improve kazette

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,200
so it was a mutually beneficial

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,320
arrangement there working with the

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,760
the folks collaborating on kazette and

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,600
we've seen

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,960
a number of other pieces of work in many

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,600
cases uh

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,280
with no explicit uh collaboration with

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,320
the uh the calcite community

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,440
at all but people discovering the uh the

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,000
work we've been doing with

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,640
with apache calcite and then leveraging

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,039
that to

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,000
implement their their own systems uh

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,400
which i think is

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,400
is just really really great to see that

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,120
we're able to uh to build something

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,240
that's useful uh not just to uh to folks

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,360
in industry

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,400
but also to those who are really uh

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,760
pushing things at the

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,320
the cutting edge from an academic

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,320
perspective

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,960
okay so now here i think is the uh the

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,760
really interesting part which

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,559
you know hopefully is why some of you uh

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,000
you listening

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:31,840
are here which is how to actually

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:36,000
get involved with a collaboration

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:38,240
between academia and asf projects

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,120
so first of all for anyone who might

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,480
happen to be

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:45,200
an academic or reformed academic room

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,159
uh just reasons you might want to to

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,720
choose

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,080
the apache software foundation to uh to

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,520
work with

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,840
and i think this can be a full to

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,080
to find people who may be interested in

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,960
problems that you're trying to solve

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,320
um or also to find problems that that

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,640
may be interesting

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,240
to people that you have working with you

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,880
and and certainly i've

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,880
found both in my time collaborating with

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,880
people on asf projects

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,000
uh you may also discover some some

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,080
interesting

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,280
technology that may not be be published

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,080
yet that could be

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,400
worth exploring uh and finally is was

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,880
the

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,440
the case for me i was able from a

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,600
practical

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,200
perspective to uh to save a lot of time

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,840
by by building on some

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,480
existing platforms uh instead of trying

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,240
to

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:37,520
write my my own systems from scratch

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,840
so this is kind of mirroring my my own

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,400
journey and working with asf projects

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,600
was just looking for uh for a project

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,000
that happened to

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,520
suit my my interest and and some of my

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,600
expertise

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,120
and then actually just getting started

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,679
writing some code

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,240
and in my case that uh that led to a lot

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,799
of uh

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,600
very fruitful collaboration so i think

00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,440
that's uh

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,039
something that's that's good for anyone

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,840
who might be interested

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,520
uh in this kind of collaboration to

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,840
explore

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,200
now from the other side for for folks

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,320
who are are currently

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:15,200
working with the the asf and wondering

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,159
why it might actually be interesting to

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,960
work with with folks in academia

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,440
first of all i think it's a good way to

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,480
get

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,679
exposure for a project uh potentially

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,640
also

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,120
some more committers so for example you

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,039
know

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,520
edmund after working with us on on

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,480
calcite uh now also has the uh the

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,840
commit bit

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,679
on on calcite it's also

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,600
uh really helpful to get a different

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,120
perspective on on problems that you're

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,039
uh that you're solving

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,000
uh when you're working with uh with

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:50,720
folks in academia versus industry folks

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,080
often people may look at problems from a

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,720
different

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,840
lens and that can be really helpful in

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,400
trying to

00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,440
move things forward and you might also

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,919
just happen to

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,360
find people who are very interested in

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,039
solving some of the

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,200
the problems that you're that you're

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,720
having and might also be able to

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,080
contribute some

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,000
new technologies or new methods and

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,520
techniques for for solving problems that

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,279
your project is facing

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,760
that you may not have otherwise been

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,760
aware of

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,720
so from the uh the perspective of asf

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,640
folks i think there's there's a couple

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,080
different uh ways that you can end up

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,919
getting involved with with folks in

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,720
academia so

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,200
one if you if you have a problem uh you

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,840
know a technical problem that you're

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,679
finding is challenging to solve one

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,000
approach of handling this would be to

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,960
to contact some researchers who are

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,760
working on

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,880
relevant problems in that area and many

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,880
of us are certainly

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:53,360
happy to to find good problems often

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,159
we have for various reasons good

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,000
students who are

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,760
looking for for different problems to uh

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,679
to work on as well and

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:04,720
we're often able to contribute a

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,799
you know intelligent person power to uh

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,520
to work on some of these problems

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,320
uh and there's certainly also other uh

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,159
you know more

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,600
formal programs there such as you know

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,600
google summer of code

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:20,080
um other mentorship programs that uh

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,799
the asf has been uh collaborating with

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,600
that also

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:27,200
can be a great fit for for students

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,720
from the other perspective you might

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,799
have a very

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,760
interesting solution that you've

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,799
developed as

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,120
part of one of your projects that

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,440
you think may be uh maybe interesting to

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,360
uh to those in academia

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,360
and the first thing say there is that

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,640
academic conferences are certainly

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,640
not limited to academics i'm sure

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,120
many are already aware of this but there

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,080
are a large number of academic

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,360
conferences

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:58,559
that have an industrial track that's

00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:01,440
designed for people to present

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,880
real world work with with systems and

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,919
their uh their collaboration with

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,159
industry that

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,320
that may have some unique technical

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,720
elements that could be uh interesting

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,320
to uh to academics and you know this

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,000
could be a good opportunity to

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,960
potentially find

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,159
an interesting academic person to uh to

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,720
partner with

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,080
now some of the the challenges finally

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,039
that that i found

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,559
uh in trying to uh to work with the the

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,960
asf

00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,760
you know sometimes writing a working

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,240
code

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,840
uh is is a lot harder than writing code

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,559
ready to uh to commit

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,399
uh and often as you're a grad student it

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:43,919
can be difficult to uh to find

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:46,799
time to write uh really good code

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,960
uh and i i think from all of the uh the

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,240
code that i've seen in asf projects that

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,919
i've worked with

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:56,799
it's generally good code and if you

00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,880
have ever seen a code that was written

00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:01,279
as part of a research paper

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,399
under a deadline in many cases

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,880
unfortunately

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,840
you you probably would not uh describe

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,360
that as

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,080
good code and so that can be a bit of a

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,320
challenge to

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,399
actually set aside the uh the time to do

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,799
that um and often

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,000
many advisors of students also don't

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,320
really have the uh

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,760
the time or or in some cases you know

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,159
the uh

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,000
the deep technical knowledge of the the

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,640
systems themselves to actually do

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
uh appropriate code review so this is

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,440
another uh scenario where

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,919
we're partnering with with folks at the

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,240
asf can be quite helpful

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,559
um on the flip side you know industry

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,679
folks uh may find it difficult to

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:43,120
find time to uh to write papers often

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,320
this uh this might be something that

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,720
that could be

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,679
a difficult uh sell to try to get time

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,000
to

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,799
work on these things so this is another

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,480
case where

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,880
these sorts of partnerships can be

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,880
helpful

00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,799
so as as for me what i'm doing now in

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,080
this area

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:05,520
i'm still a a somewhat active

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,720
member of the uh of the calcite uh pmc

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,880
and being fairly early on in my career

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,000
i'm i'm fortunate enough that i i still

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,279
have the opportunity

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,440
to write code quite regularly

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:19,039
and i also have uh several of my

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,919
students regularly uh

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,880
working with uh with code on apache

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,360
projects

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,360
and i think it's been a great uh and

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,600
useful experience from uh from both

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,080
sides there

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,640
but uh that is uh all i had for you

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,840
today

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,440
so if anyone has uh has any questions or

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,000
there's anything that that you'd like to

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,840
discuss

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,840
i'd be happy to answer

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,760
so feel free to uh to type a question in

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,799
the uh in the chat

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,679
okay so i'm sharon i'm here to sort of

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,720
help as well

00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,559
um so meanwhile um

00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,760
people are thinking about any questions

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,799
for uh for michael

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,559
i had i had a few actually so

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,080
with the amount of sort of open source

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:07,360
tools out there i mean

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,000
in in academia is is there like a i

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,240
don't know an

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,679
open source tool stack that people

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,720
automatically go because you think about

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,200
academia and

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,640
limited planning so open source tools

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,640
are all the rage is that

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,399
is that true or absolutely i mean i

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,840
think it really depends on the uh on the

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,880
domain that you're uh that you're

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,279
working in

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,240
um so so one of the uh the challenges

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,120
sometimes

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,600
um is is really finding you know a tool

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,080
set

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,159
that is is both useful for the problem

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,799
domain that that you're working on

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,840
uh but also you know is going to be

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:41,200
flexible enough

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:43,760
to uh to really get deep into uh the

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,360
internals and mess around with things um

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,960
and it really depends on you know the

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,200
type of research you're doing so

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,000
you know if you're more on the the

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,080
applied side

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,679
of things for example uh you're probably

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,000
going to have a much easier time

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,000
finding a you know a useful software

00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,519
stack for uh for your purposes

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,200
um so for example you know people

00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:05,760
working in uh research on applied

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,720
deep learning you know obviously these

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,200
days have a huge amount of tools uh

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,559
available to them and and things like uh

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,159
like tensorflow and

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,720
one and you know even from the uh the

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,519
apache side you know ml lib from uh from

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,039
spark and

00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,000
and so on um for people who are uh who

00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,919
are really uh

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,919
you know getting deep into the uh the

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,039
internals of some of these systems that

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,559
it can be challenging

00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:33,919
so i'm i'm a database researcher myself

00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:35,039
uh i know you know postgres is often a

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:39,039
common target for

00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:42,000
for people who want to get deep into

00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,120
the guts of of query optimizers like

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,960
that

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,960
calcite we've also seen fortunately

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,919
start to uh to gain some popularity

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,240
there

00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,399
and and i think that's one reason why

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,360
it's great to uh to have these

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:57,039
open source projects be made known in

00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,760
new year because i know

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,760
that uh that others even in uh in my

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,519
research group as a as a grad student

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,480
other students other faculty

00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,159
uh were generally not aware of calcite

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,399
and i i'd heard uh

00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,080
from from several people at conferences

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,360
i've been to once we had discussed

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,279
calcite a little bit

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,200
that it likely would have uh have saved

00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,679
them a lot of time had they known that

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,080
the uh

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,440
that the project existed uh because you

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,120
know it

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,039
when you have something that you can at

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,480
least you know start with as a as a

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,720
foundation that's uh

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,559
that's designed to be uh extensible that

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,919
you can work with it can certainly save

00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:34,000
you a lot of time from starting from

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,480
scratch

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,120
another question so you talked about

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,480
your your journey in open source and

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,519
and you know the sort of challenges and

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,480
things that you faced um

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,080
i i attended a a session i think it was

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,279
on the on the tuesday

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,919
uh what from daniel ruggieri and he he

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,720
had

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,399
put together some a syllabus for

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,480
teaching open source

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:01,039
yeah i think just a semester course of

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,159
you know and

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,600
you're would would it be is is that an

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,919
option or do you think that

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,519
you know people need to learn about open

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,600
source by participating

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,559
rather than just the theory i mean i'm

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,840
just trying to

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:18,799
see sure yeah i mean i i would say both

00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,880
so i i think uh it's great for students

00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:23,519
to have the opportunity to uh to

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,480
participate in open source projects

00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,360
and many students i know uh here at my

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,640
institution

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:33,279
uh do so of their own accord these are

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,360
often you know the the top tier students

00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:38,799
who many of whom are already

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:41,279
fairly skilled coders even as freshmen

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,919
but i think it can be helpful certainly

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,159
to

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,039
actually spend the time educating

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,039
students

00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,399
on open source on some of the uh the

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,320
tools used on

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,799
on how they can uh can participate

00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,760
because not all students uh necessarily

00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,679
feel

00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,880
comfortable just uh just jumping right

00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,640
in even if they

00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,399
they do have most of the skills they

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,279
would they would need to do so

00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:05,120
uh and over here we uh it's it's still

00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,279
in in pretty early stages we

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,919
have an initiative that's uh that's

00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:12,720
starting here called uh open at rit

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:14,560
that's looking at how we can incorporate

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,159
uh open source into

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,079
different areas of the uh of the

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,040
curriculum whether it's you know finding

00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,960
ways for

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,240
for students to contribute to open

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,320
source projects how

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,000
how we can use open source software how

00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,800
that that fits into

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,359
our research agendas as well so i think

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,960
there's a

00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,280
there's a lot that can be be done there

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,879
and and i i think i should probably uh

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,639
connect with uh with daniel moore in

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,480
that so i'm glad you you brought that up

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,839
i just see a comment here from from

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,879
tomic um

00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:45,359
he says i think engaging in oss projects

00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,560
may teach people more than uh dummy

00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:49,440
projects that

00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,079
are sometimes done in the universities

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,040
yes

00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,159
yes so i i absolutely agree with that

00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,560
and and i'll say uh

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,599
you know i would love to uh to see that

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,040
happen more

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,520
uh in my my courses as well uh you know

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,359
i think

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,560
it can be uh can be challenging

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,960
depending on the uh

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,119
the nature of the course uh in in my

00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,359
case i'm mostly spending uh

00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:14,240
time working with our graduate students

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:16,640
so we're often uh you know working on

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,440
fairly specific topics and and problems

00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,599
where

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,960
it can be a little bit more challenging

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,560
to to find

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,079
you know open source projects that we

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,960
can uh connect with

00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,160
uh in there um i have been trying to you

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,960
know find ways to

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,839
uh to get my students uh contributing to

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,720
to open source

00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,920
either uh as as part of their uh their

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,560
course work or

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,640
some of their their final projects that

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,440
need uh and so on but uh yeah it can be

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,440
a challenge

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,880
yeah i think the follow-up question is

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,960
do you think it can be changed

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,200
and how but i think you've pretty much

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,880
responded to that as well yeah

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,160
okay um so so um one of the things you

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,160
mentioned as well was

00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:59,839
around um oh oh yeah so consider the alc

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,400
chapter oh right okay

00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,280
um so one of the lots of things here

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,280
lots of comments

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,200
um so one of the things that we have uh

00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,800
or what what as part of community

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,000
development is we're setting up of

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,560
is uh apache local communities so where

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,400
we have

00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:18,240
um either a group of apache enthusiasts

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,640
together we can sort of set up meetups

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,040
and

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,079
and and sort of training and things like

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,079
that to sort of

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,839
educate people about uh um apache

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,160
so i'm not sure i'm not sure there's one

00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:34,160
in the us yet actually so

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:36,640
um but we'll we'll see we'll see yeah

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,920
that's certainly right you're in

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,880
partners all right you're in canada

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,720
right

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,240
no i'm in i'm in rochester new york i

00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,240
wasn't really here

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,880
but uh yeah i just uh hopped on the

00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,400
other side of the border

00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,160
well and i think certainly you know one

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,920
other way that uh that open source can

00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,280
uh can fit in especially

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,079
uh you know in in larger uh technology

00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,119
colleges

00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:01,680
uh such as as here at rit you know we

00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,800
regularly have sizable uh student

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,520
hackathons

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,960
um here our regular hackathon is called

00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,359
brickhack

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,560
and we have you know hundreds of of

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,040
students typically uh

00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,920
participating in in these hackathons and

00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,720
and i think that's

00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,480
certainly another case where there can

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,640
be a lot of integration with uh

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,000
with open source there whether it's you

00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,599
know trying to uh

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,320
to find some uh some problems that uh

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,640
open source projects are having and and

00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,640
have

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,760
a hackathon be focused on on solving

00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,520
some of those or

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,200
you know leveraging some of those uh

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,119
technologies as well

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,560
and the same was certainly true uh when

00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,079
i was in grad school

00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:44,000
uh we had uh the university of waterloo

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,599
hosted a hack the north which i i

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,160
believe is is canada's

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,160
largest uh hackathon drew like several

00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,000
thousand participants there so that's

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,640
that's certainly uh you know another uh

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,079
great venue for that

00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:00,240
okay so sorry i i've

00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,839
sort of asked you all the questions so

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,599
if if you have any other questions for

00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,880
michael then please pop them into the

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,160
chat

00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,800
so thank you very much for a great

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,960
presentation it's really interesting

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,640
great thank you and yes certainly if uh

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,880
if anyone is interested in uh in

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,280
discussing uh more on this topic

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,000
uh you are are welcome to uh to reach

00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,320

contact info

00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:28,079
on my uh on my slides here um but uh

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,160
there is uh is my my name here uh and if

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,880
you were to uh to search for me you will

00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,560
our

00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,200
community track um so we've had three

00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,079
days

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,079
of really really interesting talks lots

00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,079

be

00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,280
part of the community track uh this year

00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,640
at

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,880
