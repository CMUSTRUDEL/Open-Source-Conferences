A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

In this talk we'll talk about the research efforts the D&I committee has been working on for the past year. We'll talk with our researchers and will deep dive into the insights and results we obtained from the three phases of our work: The ASF Community Survey, the D&I research interviews and our quantitative analysis with Bitergia's technology. We'll also have an opportunity to ask questions to the researchers and the team behind this effort.

all right so welcome everyone to this

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,960
session where we're going gonna be

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,399
discussing the state of diversity and

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,760
inclusion at the apache silver

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,520
foundation

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,520
so here with me are uh par like the

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,680
participants of the team that help us

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,680
make this research possible

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,719
so anita sarma from oregon state

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,000
university

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,200
danielle scardo from pitergia marion

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,600
gizani from the

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,600
from oregon state university as well and

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,320
gary gilling who was also part of the

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,640
team but

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,480
is not here with us today but also a

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,960
crucial part of this research

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,879
team and lastly myself christel de

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,479
cuevas from the apache solar foundation

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,479
as a vp of diversity of english

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,360
so let me introduce you to what

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,880
motivated us to do the research that

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,760
we're going to be presenting to you

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,400
today

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,320
so in 2018 when the diversity and

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,520
inclusion committee was formed

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,680
we defined short-term goals medium-term

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,680
goals as well as long-term goals

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,680
so in the short-term goals we discussed

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,960
that we wanted to

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,200
gather scientific data that could help

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,200
us

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,040
study the current state of diversity and

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,600
inclusion in the foundation

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,880
specifically in the communities of our

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,040
projects

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,079
we also said that we wanted to raise

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,399
awareness about

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,000
what are some of the uh contribution

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,840
barriers that

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,360
some people face when they want to

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,759
participate in the projects

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,119
as well as find any indicators of things

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,479
that might help us

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:59,920
track over time to measure progress

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,960
year-over-year on the medium-term goals

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,520
we wanted to have a participation

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,439
baseline

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,880
understand where we are today based in

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,039
the metrics that we defined

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,479
as well as to create a toolkit that will

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,080
help projects

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,599
identify ways to smooth

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,440
the contribution barriers for their

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,400
projects and lastly

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,440
we want to like little by little become

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,440
a trusted partner

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,760
for each of the projects at the apache

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,640
sovereign foundation to address

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,599
these contribution borrowers as well as

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,440
becoming more

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,920
inclusive and diverse in their

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,959
communities

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,599
so as part of this research we actually

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,000
drove three different efforts that have

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,040
taken a year to complete

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,360
and these three efforts are uh like

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,680
are part of complementing each other to

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,440
get a deeper dive into the

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,519
re into the insights that we have been

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,160
getting from one another

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,280
so the first effort that we launched was

00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,519
a community survey

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,200
that you might remember uh launched in

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,080
december last year

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,480
and that i am to give us that baseline

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,879
that we were discussing previously

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,400
after the community survey we we

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,959
designed we defined

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,159
a few hypotheses that we wanted to test

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,159
through interviews

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,840
these interviews were just another

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,920
avenue to deep dive

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,680
into some of these hypotheses and find

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,159
more information about them

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,239
and lastly we are currently moving into

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,480
the quantitative analysis that will help

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,799
us

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,799
understand the activity in some of the

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,440
projects to tie back to some of the

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,040
insights

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,040
that we got from the previous efforts

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,200
so after each of these three efforts

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,000
were completed

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,560
we are we started to see some trends on

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,680
the internet

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,239
that we got from this investigation the

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,840
top

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,519
insights that we got are here in the

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,319
screen i'm going to walk you through

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,319
through them

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,239
the first one is that the typical apache

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,720
foundation contributor is a male

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,799
that is fluent in english or proficient

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,840
in english it's highly educated

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,519
and also has time to volunteer so

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,360
these attributes is what make the

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,799
baseline of our contributors

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,200
at the foundation the second insight is

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,680
that

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,720
the top challenge types and we will hear

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,879
more about this

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,079
as marion and anita walk us through the

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,519
research

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,759
are within three main types of topics

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,400
first one is the contributor background

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,320
in this category we find things

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,080
we find dimensions such as the language

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,280
that the contributor speaks

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,639
the culture how technical they

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,560
are or how technical is their expertise

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,639
and then we have technical hurdles

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,360
technical hurdles refer more to the

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,759
project

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,919
the architecture the technologies that

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,320
are used to contribute to them

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,120
and lastly communication communication

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,960
styles processes etc

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,040
and lastly one of the one very

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,360
interesting insight that we got is that

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,960
challenge experienced by minorities are

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,560
not only present when someone

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,479
starts contributing or are new

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,440
contributors they persist

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,960
as they evolve in the contributor funnel

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,600
they become committers or part of the

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,400
pmc

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,400
day is still true

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,840
all right so from these three insights

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,280
that

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,360
we we saw we have through

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,720
preliminary recommendations that can

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,039
help ease them

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,479
the first one is to document a bachelor

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,520
foundation and project

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,280
specific policies and expectations it is

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,800
true that some projects already do this

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,720
but there's also others that have the

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,840
opportunity to do this in a more clear

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,919
way and accessible to everyone

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,520
a second recommendation is to streamline

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,720
contribution and decision making

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,440
processes

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,160
so this will help understand along with

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,639
the

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,479
queer documented expectations what are

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,720
the processes that a newcomer should

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,080
follow as well as creating safe space

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,039
for the current

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,840
for the people currently contributing

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,240
and lastly

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,919
is to create accessible resources for

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,360
technical contributions such as

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,039
documentation

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,199
setting up the contribution environment

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,520
etc

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,479
all right so with this i am going to

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,479
pass it to

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,400
daniel who's going to share with us the

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,840
phase 1 of the survey

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,080
sure so um the survey was

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,199
uh well we are starting to discuss about

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,160
the survey

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,680
in october 2019 where we had the survey

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,000
design and

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,680
this was released to the community for

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,280
further discussion

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,280
uh the following months and so on so

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,720
we have this community feedback in in

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,560
the next two months

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,280
so as as as greece mentioned we had the

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,639
release of the

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,400
of the service probably you will

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,560
remember by the end of the year

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,919
of the last year so we have in these two

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,600
months really

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,680
fruitful and interesting community

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,360
feedback with open discussions and

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,599
comments and concerns and

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,880
et cetera et cetera and then we started

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,680
the data collection

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,479
um in at the end of the last year

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,240
beginning of

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:02,319
of this year in 2020 and we have bunch

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,360
of emails that were sent mainly

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,360
to the committee's mailing list um

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,759
well we we kept asking probably you

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,160
remember as well we kept asking to

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,479
have more answers and so on and then we

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,319
had the opportunity to

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,360
to to to attract more more interaction

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,599
in

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,759
standing at the at the both in in boston

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,880
that i so thank you sharon for your time

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,240
there as well

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,720
and we were working there together um

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,240
this was the deadline extended till till

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,840
the end of february so that was a time

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,599
where where we close on

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,720
uh the survey the survey is split into

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,960
six main areas

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,639
uh you can see at the bottom a long url

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,120
so we will share the slides with all of

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,960
you

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,400
so this is already publicly available in

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,120
the confluence

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,720
apache site and the six main areas are

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,720
as you can see contributor role and

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,680
tenure motivation availability of

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,720
protocols or

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,400
guidelines support for newcomers

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,120
diversity in inclusion

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,160
and then wrap-up session section where

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,840
we ask for

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,199
a specific um if any of you have a

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,440
specific interest to

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,400
to follow up with us on the right you

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,039
can see

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,319
an example of the website that we uh

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,319
that we produce for

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,919
for the survey and then again at the at

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,599
the bottom you can see the url where you

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,759
have you know in the wiki the

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,720
all of the questions so then we can we

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,120
can reproduce

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,400
uh part of the analysis the survey is

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,800
based on

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,759
on different inputs one of them is of

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,120
course the

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,680
survey that were run by by saran in 2016

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,839
so part of that feedback and and and

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,440
questions we had integrated into this

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,200
into this new version and then some

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,880
others as

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,120
coming from openstack the chaos

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,160
community and some others

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,600
um the process

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,600
this couple of months

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,200
was based on a couple of internal

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,200
iterations followed each of them by

00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,800
feedback process this was done

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,680
in google docs and we asked for public

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,959
feedback

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,600
looking for for input in the in

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,480
different main list so we had the

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,839
specific

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,680
comments by the people we have

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,120
discussions and so on

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,640
and we have the usual bolt-in and better

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,560
process followed by

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,920
uh by the bmc um well all of this is

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,519
we are sharing all of this with you

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,720
because uh we want this to be

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,959
reproducible in the

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,560
in the future so then you have all of

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,240
this information the process

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,640
documentation a lot of the questions et

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,120
cetera et cetera

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:39,040
um we had a we reach a total of uh

00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,600
624 response responses which is around

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,519
nine percent of response rate based on

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,880
a total community size of committees of

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,200
seven thousand

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,959
um yep so these are more or less the

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,480
numbers we open it's true that we open

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,800
the uh

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,720
the survey to anyone that even

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,760
participated in the community but

00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:01,120
the main focus uh initially was uh

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,240
were the committers now uh anita your

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,000
turn

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,160
all right thank you daniel so when we

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,680
got the survey results for the analysis

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,640
we kind of focus on three main

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,399
dimensions

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,200
one is demographics you know like the

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,320
age gender english fluency as well as

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,560
background culture

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,240
like where they grew up uh participants

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,399
and where they are working now

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,000
a socio-economic status which includes

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,839
their education background

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,920
whether they are paid or unpaid that's

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,000
what compensation means here

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,399
and how much time do they have volunteer

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,800
in a weekly basis

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,480
we also look at the experiences in asf

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,040
itself like the tenure

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,120
uh whether they had mentors and what

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,600
kind of challenges they might be facing

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,760
and how many challenges they are facing

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,279
they specifically looked at these three

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,760
dimensions as

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,560
analysis lenses because we wanted to

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,880
kind of

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,680
look into barriers and challenges in

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,200
open source

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,360
and past research has said this is

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,360
something useful so going into the

00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,480
survey results

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,600
as grace had kind of alluded to it

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,320
um the majority respondents kind of fit

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,600
into this

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,000
average asf contributor if you look at

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,160
the demographics this is a 40 years old

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,360
man who is confident in english

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,839
and has been born and lives in the usa

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,959
um they have a bachelor's degree they

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,279
are working

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,519
as a volunteer and they have one to two

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,880
hours per week to do that

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,640
they have been in the community for

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,399
about five years uh

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,680
didn't have a mentor when they started

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,440
and they're doing pretty well now

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,880
they're not facing any challenges right

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,680
so this is kind of the broad

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,200
view of your typical asaf contributor so

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,480
next few slides we're going to go

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,320
deeper into these different dimensions

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,480
the first thing if you look at the slide

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,800
if you look at the pie chart

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,640
at the bottom is you know what is the

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,320
effect of formal education

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,160
and we found majority 57 percent who had

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,279
some kind of a graduate degree either a

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,959
master's or a phd and another 32 or

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,200
alexa 33 person

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,760
who had some college bachelor's degree

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,040
and only about 10.5 without any college

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,720
education

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,399
if i can draw your attention to the bar

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,560
charts where

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,200
purple means they are unpaid and it goes

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,360
all the way to green which is fully paid

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,399
so if you just look at the eyeball the

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,120
bar charts here

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,760
those who had no college education seems

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,160
to be more

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,519
volunteers and and there seems to be a

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,360
trend about that

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,760
so what we wanted to do is like you know

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,040
what is the effect of formal education

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,839
on being compensated while working asf

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,519
we ran a chi-square test to see if these

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,639
differences we are seeing are actually

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,079
significant

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:42,320
at the level of 0.05 and we did find

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,279
such a significance so yes seems like

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,000
education does

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,760
impact compensation so what might be

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,320
happening what we are thinking might be

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,240
happening

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,399
is those who do not have formal

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,279
education without any college

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,240
might be volunteering at asf to you know

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,639
build their skills

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,200
build their careers but we have a very

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,920
short percentage only 10.5 percentage of

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,800
these people

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,079
who are our contributor the question of

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,399
the community then is you know

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,800
how do you attract volunteers who have

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,079
no college education to broaden the base

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,320
and also you know

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,160
help people you know reach their career

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,760
goals

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,360
next slide daniel next question was kind

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,880
of looking at the demographics was you

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,839
know what is the effect of english

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,160
fluency

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,959
on challenges looking at the pie chart

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,760
again about

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,160
80 percent of the respondents are kind

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,560
of

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,600
at least confident in english fluency

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,600
13.1

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,680
thinks that average and about seven

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,440
percent who are uncomfortable

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,959
looking at the bar chart again those who

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,360
are uncomfortable or

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,800
have average fluency do seem to be

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,000
facing more challenges

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,079
and again these differences were

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,360
statistically significant

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,760
so the question of the community then

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,519
comes back is you know what can we do

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,279
to lower the language barrier that

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,279
exists especially since

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,720
all discussions and every communication

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,800
in asf is happening

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,959
via english so what can we do to broaden

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,519
our base again

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,040
that's right then comes the effect of

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,839
gender

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,639
not surprisingly about 89 percent of our

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,399
respondents

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,880
um identified as men 4.6 as women

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,000
and a short percentage over six percent

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,920
where we can't

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,600
constitute them as others these were

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,320
people who did not want to disclose

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,440
their gender

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,279
or prefer to self-describe um

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,800
and if you look at the challenges faced

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,720
there seems to be a trend again

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,880
men seem to be facing less challenges

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,399
than women and these differences are

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,639
statistically significant

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,880
so the question again comes out is what

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,199
can we do to reduce these values

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,040
and we'll go a little bit into deeper uh

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,079
when maryam presents about what these

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,639
challenges are that might be occurring

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,880
um this is the last of our barchar slice

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,600
and here what we wanted to do was like

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,920
you know

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,440
challenges exist but does having a

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,680
mentor actually help

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,959
so our chart shows here the pie chart on

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,920
the bottom that

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,680
a large majority 62 percent did not have

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,240
a mentor when they joined

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,839
whereas 36 percent had a mentor and we

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,839
have this little gray sliver that is

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,880
about eight or 18 participants

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,160
who have not made a contribution yet so

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,519
when we came into the

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,519
research we thought you know having a

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,920
mentor would be something that will

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,040
lead to lower challenges but the results

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,440
are kind of opposite

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,240
seems like those who have had mentors

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,480
have faced

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,079
slightly more challenges the results are

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,560
statistically significant

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,360
but this is counterintuitive and does

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,839
bring to the

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,240
you know mind questions like you know

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,720
why is mentoring actually not helping

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,959
reduce challenges is it because those

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,199
who are actively seeking out mentors

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,040
are those who face challenges are those

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,279
who are underrepresented and

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,399
face you know additional hurdles are the

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,560
other people

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,160
looking for mentors or is you know

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,079
mentoring not really helpful

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,680
like is it mentioned for projects

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,079
mentoring for individuals

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,800
what is the role of mentors in asf and

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,639
what could be

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:05,360
done to actually reduce these challenges

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,360
next slide please

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,320
so just as a recap of what we talked

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:13,120
about so education did impact

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,720
compensation those in minorities face

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,920
more challenges

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,560
english fluency gender effects

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,800
mentor not so much we also did a

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,800
segmented analysis of

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,480
men who said they are facing challenges

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,920
to see if there was any demographic

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,800
differences but we couldn't find

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,040
anything

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,880
we also looked at the segmented analysis

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,519
of those who had moved countries when

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,000
they grew up

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,680
but again nothing to report so i'm going

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,360
to hand it over to maryam now who's

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,440
going to go deeper into this

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,000
deeper dive follow-on of survey

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,440
respondents and the challenges

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,560
thank you anita uh so our feast 2 was

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,560
about the interviews

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,440
so the objective here was mainly to

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,279
identify

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,279
what are these challenges that asf

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:02,839
contributors are facing

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:05,120
and from the survey we had 221

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,640
contributors report that they face at

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,400
least a few challenges

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,079
and they describe their challenges in an

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,319
open-ended question

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,360
but we wanted to dive deeper into this

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,919
so we

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,959
followed up with interviews we did 19

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,319
interviews

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,799
from june to september 2020

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,120
and these interviews were of two types

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,880
so we had follow-up interviews with

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,160
contributors that did respond to the

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,960
survey um

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,880
and we followed up with contributors

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,840
that were within the gender minority

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,240
group

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,960
those that were within language minority

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,039
group

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,480
and also contributors who identified as

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,080
men and

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,679
reported facing at least a few

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,240
challenges

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,760
in addition to this we also added

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,840
additional interviews

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,320
with people that were not part of the

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,760
survey so these are contributors who

00:17:52,320 --> 00:18:00,480
left the community

00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:03,760
and newcomers who are interning with asl

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,320
so after running these interviews we did

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,400
multiple rounds of qualitative analysis

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,679
of both the interviews and the survey

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,480
responses and we ended up finding 12

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,440
categories of challenges so these

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,720
categories

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,760
each one of them comprises of subsequent

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,039
subcategories

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,600
and subsequent challenges so if we look

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,000
into

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,880
the middle graph the tree diagram over

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
there

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,880
we can see the full image of the

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,520
categories and challenges out of those

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,320
uh

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,679
six categories were already found in

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,400
academia

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,600
in other open source projects and were

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,240
linked to

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,600
challenges for newcomers coming in and

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,240
six others were specific to asl

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,320
the red dot in that like tree diagram

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,919
represents the ones that were specific

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,640
to asf

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,200
so if we look into this flowchart over

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,880
here

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,919
um we can see that the top part which is

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,160
um in red um

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,640
we can see that that was the those were

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,200
the categories that were specific to asl

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,919
and here we see that communication comes

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,880
up

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,400
quite a few times we also see process

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,440
and geolocation

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,559
as categories of challenges from the

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,679
challenges that were

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:26,799
found in literature but also ended up

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,799
being also in the asf data we can see

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,320
the contributors background we can see

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:33,440
the technical hurdles

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,559
documentation problems etc

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,880
in these challenges what we found about

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,440
them

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,760
is that the inter-represented groups

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,400
tend to continue facing these challenges

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,600
even

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:49,840
after becoming experienced

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,840
so moving on to the next slide

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,480
so now let's take a look into a specific

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,440
category

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,440
um so for example the technical hurdles

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,880
in this category we found

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,360
three subcategories um hurdles

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,200
associated with this change request

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,280
hurdles associated with

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,320
the code architecture and ones

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:15,600
associated with local environment setup

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,280
so let's take an example of the change

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,159
request hurdles

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,480
quite a few people mentioned the delay

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:25,200
to get contribution accepted or reviewed

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,760
and also the fact of getting a

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,159
contribution accepted was quite hard

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,280
for instance one of the participants

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,280
mentioned this

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,280
i had the difficulty to understand

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,559
project guidelines for accepting code

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,559
changes

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,159
some remarks indicated that style

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,280
guidelines were important

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,919
yet large refactorings were shunned

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,960
another contributors mentioned this by

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,799
saying

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,960
it was hard to convince the project

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,640
committers in my decision

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,039
and why they should have accepted my

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,039
code

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,120
moving on to another

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:04,320
challenge category and this was one of

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,720
the challenges that was

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,480
specific to asf and this was the

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,200
communication category

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,400
which um included the style of

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,720
communication

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,200
the tools used for communicating and

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,559
also interaction hurdles

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,480
so for the style of communication uh

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,559
the main thing that was reported was the

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,080
use of slang irony and technical

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,880
discussions

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,080
for instance um one contributors

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,919
mentioned

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,200
some people use more idiomatic

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,520
expressions when

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,280
expressing their feelings for example

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,559
which is hardly understandable or

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:43,120
misleading to non-native speakers

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,000
another subcategory of the communication

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,520
hurdles was

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,559
the challenges related to interaction

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,240
for instance conflicting views were

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,919
mainly reported in

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,600
different ways of viewing the project

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,360
the vision of the project or its

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,280
architecture

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,559
for instance technical disputes over

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,159
architectural

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:07,120
direction of a project another

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,440
um challenge that was mentioned was

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,480
about the overwhelming interaction

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,760
uh and for this we have

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,320
some contributors uh mentioning that

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,960
also very hard for an underrepresented

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,440
newcomer

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,480
or coder to catch up with a heated

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,919
discussion

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,000
with the heated discussions on the

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,799
member list i was happy being a

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,280
committer

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,200
but once i saw all the member discussion

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,039
in the list i was overwhelmed

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,799
i have never commented on the members

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,919
list for this reason

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:40,080
um so this was an overview of the

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:43,120
challenges that we found in the

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,480
surveys and also the interviews and i'll

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,200
hand it over to daniel

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,280
with the quantitative analysis sure

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,720
thank you thank you very much for

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,799
all of the work up to now so the

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,080
quantitative analysis is a thing that is

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,320
happening next

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,840
um we are focusing on initially untold

00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,720
projects that are the ones that you have

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,760
listed here

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,360
flowing cassandra cows tv and others and

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,600
these were listed by

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,640
uh survey youngsters so we were

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,039
aggregating them

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,720
and counting the number of times that

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,760
they appeared and so on so these are the

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,720
the most

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,600
um the most mentioned once and again in

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,039
the

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,919
in the in the analysis in the survey um

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:24,320
the the goal of this analysis of the

00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,480
quantitative analysis is to

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,440
bring some certain understanding about

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,760
the

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,080
gender diversity that we have in the

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:35,200
community for all of these projects

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,720
and of course as a limitation we are we

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,960
are going to use a specific

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,960
apis and so on that will provide that

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,640
gender based on the first name

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,320
and this means that this is first the

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,559
only attribute that we

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,000
will analyze in an automated way and

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,320
second this is

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,640
limited to a binary gender so the goal

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,159
here is not to be

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,640
any means let's say it's really concrete

00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,480
or specific but to bring certain

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,480
starting point for for further

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,080
discussion in the community

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,840
as uh limitations uh well i

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,760
just mentioned that these are related to

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,760
the binary result of the gender

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,760
and of course heuristics and how to

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,080
split the names and look for the first

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,279
name

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,080
and so on it's uh based on previous

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,440
experiences

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,520
is harder for instance to to deal with

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,400
names coming from asia than western

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,360
names that typically apis are working a

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,760
bit better

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,960
there are some specific academic studies

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,120
and so on that we

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,360
can mention later if needed so the idea

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,279
is to give this a quick overview and

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,720
current status of the diversity in this

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:42,159
project so we have

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,080
uh this this starting point um

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,279
as i mentioned this analysis is not

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,600
intended to be

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,200
let's say exhaustive by by any means so

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,320
we are focusing on certain projects

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,799
those that were

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,600
detailed by the by the community itself

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,720
and then we go

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,440
through uh the usual data sources as

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,480
uh git repositories uh pull requests

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,480
jira issues

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,720
or vaxila so we need to check the data

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,600
that it's available and check what we

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,480
have

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,120
um the output itself is a dashboard that

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,240
will

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,320
where we'll aggregate all of the

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,240
information and we'll we'll aggregate at

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,360
the level of project so then we

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,679
we don't work at the level of

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,600
individuals our goal is not to have a

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,720
specific manual data cleaning

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,480
but to bring those numbers as this

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,720
starting point for discussion you can

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,600
see at the very bottom one example of a

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,600
dashboard with

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,279
some tables a pie chart so this is the

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,279
kind of information that we have

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:36,799
at the end um so these are the

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,279
six main areas for the quantitative

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,919
analysis and then finally as a summary

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,440
for

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:46,559
for the talk so it's a reminder so

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,880
uh main insights so we

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,120
we we've seen that the the average

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,159
persona a typical isf contributor is a

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,559
male with

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,640
english proficient highly educated at

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,360
least popular and with time to volunteer

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,480
from one to

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:03,600
two hours there are

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,400
three main top challenges as greece

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,120
mentioned

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,880
the contributor background technical

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,400
hurdles as we were discussing

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:15,440
specifically in one of the interview

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:19,039
interview slides and then communication

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,720
and finally another insight is

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:23,039
that we've seen is that challenges

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,520
experienced by minorities when they

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:27,360
when they join the community they they

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,000
exist they persist even after they

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,320
become

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,039
uh they reach certain experience right

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,559
so

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:38,240
this is this is an interesting insight

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:41,279
in terms of uh recommendations we have

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,840
a certain improvement about the

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,320
project policies and expectations in

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,960
each of

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,480
the projects of the of the asf we've

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,200
seen that each of the projects at the

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,279
esf they have their own

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,520
decision-making process even when there

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:59,440
is a a general umbrella

00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,400
or a general uh genetic lines about how

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,720
to proceed

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,080
there are certain processes and so on

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,840
that they are not clear

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,279
and for this another recommendation is

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,360
to create accessible

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,960
resources for technical contributions

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,799
documentation in general

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,960
how the decision-making process works

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:18,000
and and other similar ones

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,279
um just to mention as one of the outputs

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,120
of the project we

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:23,919
we had a few months ago a readout of the

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,279
survey

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,640
that we can share later with you in the

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,200
chat and

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,640
and others and then we'll have from

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,039
these these specific

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,440
interviews and cognitive analysis

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,399
another presentation plus a final report

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,320
which is the

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:45,279
specific output of the of the project

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,360
so um i don't know mariam and italy's if

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,799
you have any other comment or so

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,799
we can go to the questions

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,720
just like you thank all of our uh

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,360
participants

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,840
can you hear me yeah i would just like

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,000
to thank all of our participants survey

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,320
as well as interviews who really gave

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,080
us the time and effort as well as grace

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,399
and in everyone at asf for

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,039
you know helping us along the way when

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,039
we go through

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,200
thank you anita i i also refer so daniel

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:23,520
uh before we we come up to the questions

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,480
i wanted to add that

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,720
the diversity and inclusion effort

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,399
started last year i've seen that in the

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,120
polls section here

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,000
a lot of the attendees are new to

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,039
apachecon

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
and also our users of the apache

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,080
software

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,840
uh projects not necessarily part of the

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,799
foundation so i wanted to give a little

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,200
bit of context

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:47,279
that last year was when we first formed

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,200
the diversity and inclusion committee

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,120
and ever since we have been creating

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,720
initiatives like this but we also have

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,480
other initiatives like the outreach

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,360
programs and there is opportunity for us

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,480
to create

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,840
more tools and more projects to help

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,080
projects become more diverse and

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:08,559
inclusive so if you are interested

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,559
you can join the conversation at dev

00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,039
diversity.apache.org

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,039
enough request

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,960
so there is there is one one question by

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,399
law friends

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:29,600
about how we came back with the

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:32,399
with the clusters and so on so i

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,159
assume lawrence that you mean do you

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:37,600
mean about the

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,320
uh the experiences and challenges for

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,600
each of the

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,399
so the three diagram that we presented

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,200
uh i think from the chat maybe maybe i

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,200
can talk about

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,240
he is referring to the readout seems

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,840
like lawrence

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,240
and where we had talked about the

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,399
cluster analysis to kind of find out

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,200
what is the majority profile

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,720
so those are more deeper answers which

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,640
we didn't go into here

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,840
because then we looked at you know who

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,880
is the

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,960
face of asf is we did some cluster

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,360
analysis so we know statistically you

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,720
know

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,240
what our main face was so happy to talk

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,399
to you more about how we came up with

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,440
those clusters but we found like one big

00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,559
cluster

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,279
that was you know north america and

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,720
the things we said the second cluster

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,200
was you know

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,200
bachelor's degree and from germany so

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,440
germany was the second biggest

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,640
country that we found our participants

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,640
to come from in the survey

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,440
do you have any other questions more

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,440
comments questions

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:53,200
so how surprised were your results maybe

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,200
greece this is a good question for you

00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,840
uh i think more than than surprise i

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,640
think it has been very insightful

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,000
to have had the interviews and have that

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,519
very good analysis

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,240
on the challenges type because we can

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,360
start to separate technical challenges

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,360
from

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,880
kind of like social interaction uh

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,640
challenges and

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,000
we can have more concrete plans to

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,320
address both i think that

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,679
that is a very positive outcome from

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,039
this research

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:27,840
and i think like it's also

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:29,440
a good way to achieve one of our

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,320
short-term goals which was

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,880
put scientific data behind the current

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,640
baseline

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,039
and not just like you know we we

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,200
anecdotally know that

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,320
the profile of the contributors at the

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,480
asf are

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,240
male uh familiar with english and all of

00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,440
that we already knew it but we wanted to

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,320
to get that data in the scientific

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,559
approach to that

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,720
so i think like more than surprises it

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:55,679
has been very good insights

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,679
and actionable too

00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:02,080
all right perhaps in another

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,600
maybe maybe anita marian you can say but

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,679
i remember that we were looking at the

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,360
at the numbers and so on and we were

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,559
surprised we were surprised about

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,880
how uh highly uh

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:15,039
how many people are with bachelor or phd

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,000
or masters and so on so that was

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,440
an interesting approach and and with

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
this the relation with

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,480
with the compensation or not in the

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
community

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,679
was one of the results right to me that

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,159
was the two major things that was

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,960
different

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,799
or surprising was amount of you know

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,279
people with college education

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:37,039
as well as higher education really and

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,559
the amount of people who are actually

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:42,240
being paid

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:43,120
as employees who responded so and that

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,519
kind of

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,120
when we go much deeper into challenges

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,440
when we put our report

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,480
did affect the incubation process and

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,279
the communication

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,360
processes so this is a new dynamics

00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:58,480
coming from an academic perspective

00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,559
that asl is in front of

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,799
with the hybrid model where you have

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,039
vendors and companies and what that

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:07,039
means to get the consensus done

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,919
what that means about how fast things

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,679
can move what that means for competition

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,279
um that are from closed sources so

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,240
that's kind of bringing out very new

00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:18,480
dynamics

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,240
into this whole um open source itself

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,080
there is there is another question about

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,799
uh if we look by yeti

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,240
if we look at any uh location i i

00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,440
understand that this is geographical

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:32,559
location as part of our

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,559
analysis maybe anita you can go online

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,440
go ahead i just i just wanted to say

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,279
that in the location

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,039
piece we actually took a very

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,919
interesting approach with the cultural

00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,600
background and

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,919
location background but anita can tell

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,919
us where

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,480
right so just a basic thing we had the

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,880
location and daniel has put in the

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,600
question so which country you are in

00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,399
a majority where from north america

00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,240
followed by

00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,840
western europe germany was kind of the

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,360
bigger bigger uh thing

00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,079
um non um like

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,879
typical suspects brazil was uh high

00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,040
enough

00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,919
uh but instead of looking at us as grace

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,839
manson just

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:18,240
from the countries we tried to find out

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:21,679
people who were moving countries like

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,440
someone who was born in um you know um

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,440
we had some people who were in the us

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,760
but now in france we have some people

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,760
a lot of people who were from india or

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,240
china but now in the us

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,480
um we took this new perspective because

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,720
what we wanted to do was like you know

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,800
um culture plays a role in how we

00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,679
communicate how we reach decisions how

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,159
we you know

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,159
talk about decision making so we wanted

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,240
to take that perspective

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,159
and and see if we could find anything

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,720
but just looking at the countryside like

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,599
you know

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,119
x country to y countries did not help us

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,040
so what we want to do like

00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,879
help us in the sense we didn't get any

00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,960
different um like significant

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,079
differences and the challenges faced

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,760
but i think what would be more

00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,720
interesting and that's something you

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,960
plan to do

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,400
is kind of do it on a continent basis or

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,160
like a cultural basis

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,160
so you know from south america to north

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,160
america or maybe western

00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,359
europe is similar to northern america

00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,240
but kind of looking at

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:17,280
asia to europe or like a little broader

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,680
analysis

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,520
more based on culture than just the

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,880
country of origin

00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,119
so that's something we want to do in the

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,520
future yeah so we

00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:31,839
i think we have five more extra minutes

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,839
for questions

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,560
robert is saying uh communication

00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,839
challenges and actions are similar to

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,839
the ones we found

00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:45,359
when we tried to scale up from the early

00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:48,000
days

00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:49,680
i don't know who can answer that so uh

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,680
yeah it seems like

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,440
it might be because one of the things

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,320
you're finding is because

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,160
the policies the asf policies are are

00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,440
kind of philosophical not

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,000
operationalized

00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,200
really maybe so as you know and you're

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,200
getting new people

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,880
the same growing up challenges might be

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:13,839
there because new people are trying to

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:16,160
figure out what is the asf

00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,160
so

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,920
alan is saying maybe chris you can

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,400
answer that

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,359
what will one thing that you do for the

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,800
pnc

00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:30,800
sure so i think like

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,720
documenting expectations and

00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,920
contribution pieces will be

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:38,640
the one thing just because the nature

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,680
of the apache way is to just have

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,839
guidelines but let

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,960
projects implement them the best way for

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:46,000
each of the communities

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,480
i think like this independence is very

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,119
it's very unique it's very good it works

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,040
and

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,680
also provides a little bit of like

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:56,000
confusion as of how to progress

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,240
to become part of the of the commuter

00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,480
community and then part of the pmc

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,000
so i have i have seen a few projects

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,640
that actually do this very well

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,599
and they like minimize that confusion so

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,040
i will say that

00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:11,280
and if your project already do it just

00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,800
also another another good tool that i

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,760
have seen there is

00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,240
a project based surveys so it helps you

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,320
understand what your project is missing

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,000
to become more more inclusive and we're

00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,760
not and i know like this might sound a

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,160
little bit repetitive from the

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,240
survey we meet but the main difference

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,440
is the survey we made was very focused

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,040
on commuters

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:35,760
and contributors so a more user in

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,720
project level survey can help you find

00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,960
if you need

00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,119
or if you have a gap on documentation or

00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,000
perhaps on contribution practices

00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,800
so those will be my two recommendations

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,640
clear

00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,880
guidelines that are documented and if

00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,280
you want to explore further

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,640
a survey and projects like apache

00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,720
airflow have

00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,200
have done a very good job with this

00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,200
survey

00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,079
okay so only three minutes so as a call

00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,230
to action probably

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,640
is if uh you are interested in

00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:11,440
[Music]

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,280
sharing more insights from your site or

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,560
providing some pointers and so on so you

00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,200
can join the

00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,040
uh development mailing list for the dni

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,520
group

00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,640
and we are all here you have we are in

00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,640
the slack channel in apache and

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:29,839
we are wrong just let us know you have

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,920
any comments concern extra questions

00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,760
so robert has a good question right over

00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,440
here you can find the voices by

00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,680
analyzing the commit records

00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,800
maybe even if it's a pr based thing

00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,880
who's actually

00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,960
talking on the pr so that would be

00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,000
something to also see like you know

00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,240
is it is it really a core few people

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,119
who are getting hurt and the rest of the

00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,040
community is

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,040
in that project is not getting hurt so

00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,800
that's why like going deeper into a

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:59,839
project-based analysis can

00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:01,760
highlight much more um making nuanced or

00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:04,000
specific problems that individual

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,040
projects can face instead of the

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,920
larger asf so that's something

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,920
we'll also look at

00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:16,160
so i think this is all for today one

00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,880
minute left so

00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,920
just to thank you all again for your

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,640
time here with us

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,920
thank you for anita maria and griez for

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,960
your

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:31,200
all of the hard work and

00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,720
let's keep working thank you

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,680
number if you want to learn more

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,079
subscribe to the dev

00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:39,200
diversity.apache.org

00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:41,680
mailing list and thank you everyone

00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:44,320
thank you have a good day thank you

00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,320
thanks everyone

00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,680
um are we just hanging out here for

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:55,280
questions or what's the

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,720
do we guess we should i guess if there's

00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,000
nobody left then we can just leave

00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,839
there's only

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,359
9 10 people here but officially it's

00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:03,119
over i guess

00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,240
but i believe sharon said you can hang

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,160
out here if you want to ask some

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:11,839
questions

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,839
oh yeah

00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,920
so robert had mentioned um

00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,599
looking at the documents so i don't know

00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,200
if you can save the chat here it might

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:28,079
be useful to save the chat so we can

00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,079
look at these questions

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,280
i was actually gonna say that in terms

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,400
of the documentation just be

00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,319
written by a few of us i think like one

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,560
of the root causes there is that also

00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,440
documentation contribution isn't really

00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,480
recognized

00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,480
equally as a tech contribution so

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,160
it could be like a chicken neck problem

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,000
there where if you don't recognize that

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,280
type of contribution or you don't make

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,160
it part of

00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,280
you know like your release kind of like

00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,640
process

00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,000
to write documentation this is never

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,280
going to be a gap that you can really

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,359
address so i think like there

00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,319
are two areas where you can make this

00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,440
part

00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:12,160
of a when somebody sends like a

00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,920
pr asks to have comprehensive

00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,640
documentation about the future

00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,839
or contribution and also encourage

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,280
participation from technical writers by

00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:23,200
recognizing documentation

00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,920
website design other type of

00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,920
contributions

00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,839
right i think that's a great point grace

00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,839
and one of the

00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:34,160
slices of research i'm trying to look at

00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:37,440
now is how to recognize

00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:39,599
non-code contributions right so

00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,000
mentoring is also an important part and

00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,319
especially for those who are

00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,920
underrepresented

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:46,079
you know you have only so much time in

00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,760
your volunteering time especially

00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,720
so you know if you go for doing

00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,760
mentoring or documentation or non-code

00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,599
related

00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,079
um contributions then your reputation in

00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,520
this

00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,079
community is not seen or you're not

00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,079
recognized so

00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,359
but without that you know your community

00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,680
is not as healthy

00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:07,280
so you're looking at ways that how to

00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,520
recognize these kind of non-code

00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,720
contributions some kind of karma points

00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,040
and things like that

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,000
so that you know projects can start to

00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,520
increase that

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
because what research has shown that um

00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,119
you know if you have this ways of

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,920
recognizing just

00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:26,240
not diverse contributions you are likely

00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,640
to get more contributors and diverse

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,040
contributors to the project

00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,720
so that can have like a feedback

00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,040
positive feedback loop

00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,079
yeah so maybe maybe uh so robert was

00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,079
pointing to uh

00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,280
perhaps a lack of diversity of voices

00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,440
robert please correct me

00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,800
wrong and he said that even today when i

00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,599
read the foundation documents i can

00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,599
guess who wrote

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:50,800
what which is quite interesting

00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:59,839
okay yeah yeah

00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:59,839
yeah yeah

00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,000
yeah it is mentioning about the all that

00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,119
represent

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:13,520
the africa is in general this is a

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:15,680
community of brilliance

00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,160
i'm going to go and see if i can very

00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,400
quickly find our full areas of readout

00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:24,319
because where we had the country so let

00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,319
me see if i can quickly look at that

00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:32,340
[Music]

00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,839
he's daniel we're so sad we deleted all

00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,839
the slides

00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,400
now i'm saying and i'm trying to go back

00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,240
to our readout and see the slides we had

00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,000
for the countries

00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,000
and we were like kind of sad right we

00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,040
removed it um

00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,319
so do you have the readout daniel this

00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,280
is our

00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:05,040
our slide deck i believe and uh if you

00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,800
go to slide 89

00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:12,880
yeah is where our

00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,800
uh where it says i just put it oh sorry

00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,280
i put the wrong one no that's not what i

00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,280
should have put

00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,040
here is the monkey head

00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:28,720
i can't do the length anita i think

00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:32,000
that's the one okay

00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:37,839
so slightly nine if you go to danielle

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,839
or maybe i can start shaving i can share

00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:55,280
so this is kind of our uh data

00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,319
of the countries oops

00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,319
come on you can do it

00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:08,960
yeah so germany 8.96

00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:12,160
united states 47 percent

00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:19,839
uh you know africa we have nairobi let's

00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:19,839
see where is nairobi

00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:25,200
[Music]

00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:27,599
yeah i don't i don't see that over here

00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,599
but maybe

00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,880
maybe it was we really didn't get

00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,200
anybody to actually answer the

00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,560
survey question then because we have

00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,560
picked up

00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,079
front of culture so nobody from nairobi

00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:44,480
answered the survey then

00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:47,920
for us so completely unrecognized then

00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:51,839
there are four countries from africa

00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:54,319
so you can see but again this is not

00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:56,240
asf view these are the participants who

00:45:54,319 --> 00:46:01,040
responded to the survey right so

00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:03,970
this is this is our pool of participants

00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,280
well anyway um

00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:06,880
[Music]

00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,960
i'm afraid i have to leave it's a bit

00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,520
late here

00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,200
yes so yeah there's no other questions i

00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,680
think we'll hang up i have a class to go

00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:19,040
to and

00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:29,839
thank you everyone thank you bye

00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:29,839
bye bye bye thank you bye-bye
