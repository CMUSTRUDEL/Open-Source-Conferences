Description: 
	Teaching Open Source
Daniel Ruggeri

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

How did you learn about Open Source? Did you learn from a mentor? Did you learn from a colleague? Did you learn through hard fought experience? For a lot of us, we learned the hard way. But... what if all of the concepts, the tools, the licensing, the methods, and the terms were gathered into a course? Come join our presenter as he walks through his motivations and experience designing and teaching a college-level course about Open Source. We will discuss how to get started, what the curriculum includes, how you could deliver such a course, and other tips and tricks.

Daniel is Vice President of Middleware at Mastercard and an Open Source evangelist. Responsible for setting the direction of Mastercard regarding the Web and Cloud space, he spends his days and nights playing with infrastructure and the code that powers it both inside the firewall and outside. He is a member of the Apache Software Foundation and has contributed code to Open Source projects from simple pet projects to widely utilized servers. As a lover of Open Source, he even taught a course about Open Source Software Development (and will share the curriculum with you!). He has spoken at several conferences about expanding Open Source in enterprises, introducing Open Source, and growing understanding of Open Source in education.

[Music]

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,439
so

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,519
hey guys i i think i'll go ahead and

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,719
begin

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,960
uh we have a we have a small group uh

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,559
and i have no idea how i'm gonna do uh

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,920
on this one you guys uh if you've ever

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,079
seen my presentations i

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,520
prefer to be very conversational right

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,760
now i'm talking to a camera

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,800
so uh you know feel free to toss

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,160
questions in there

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,559
uh you know raise your hand

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,559
uh i i don't think i have a a ton of

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,079
content and certainly everything that

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,600
we'll talk about you know is i think

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,280
we'll easily be able to cover in the

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,479
time allotted so

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,880
um we're just gonna take it from there

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,640
and uh you know like i said i i very

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,000
much prefer this to be conversational

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,799
the reason

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,280
uh i'm giving this presentation is to

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,080
show

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,200
that uh you can also teach an open

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,439
source class

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,640
um it's actually not that hard i thought

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,159
it was going to be impossible i thought

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,200
there were going to be like a bunch of

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,080
uh red tape and hoops to jump through

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,400
but uh you know it turned out to work

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,439
pretty easily and pretty straightforward

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,360
and ultimately the hardest part is the

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,840
gift that i want to give to you guys and

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,520
that is a curriculum to start from

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,040
because developing the curriculum can be

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,520
pretty hard we'll talk a little bit more

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,720
about that

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,799
so by way of quick introduction i'm

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,920
daniel you can reach me at the email

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,759
address pretty much

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,280
anytime on the screen if you have

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,520
questions comments

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,560
uh if you want to follow on it's you

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,600
know i don't mind

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,920
not at all uh at work i

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,600
i wear a vice president hat for network

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,280
services at the

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,680
uh the small company you may have heard

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,920
of it's called mastercard

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,280
there i design and build our data center

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,080
and core networks that will

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,640
you know that does globally connect all

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,680
of our

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,200
web presences and a bunch of really

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,800
interesting things

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,280
i grew up in the internet space as a web

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,319
guy started out as a pager jockey

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,520
uh on call and just kind of grew from

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,080
there

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,120
but ultimately i you know despite being

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,879
an infrastructure guy

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,200
i'm very fond of code i write code

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,040
for fun uh that's one of the things that

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,400
got me involved at the asf it's one of

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,239
the things that kind of

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,599
uh has kept my sanity during this

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,599
coveted lockdown

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,120
uh if you look on my github repo you'll

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,080
see that i've released i think four or

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,360
five projects

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,480
uh since march because of uh that exact

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,840
thing

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,239
um i'm the the last founding member of

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,560
our open source program at mastercard

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,640
uh just recently though we're getting a

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,159
lot of new attention and new interest

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,879
uh in open source within the

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:10,400
organization so i'm excited to see that

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:13,760
growing uh for play

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,480
i mean i'm involved at the asf

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,599
a former member of the board i'm vp

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,720
fundraising

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,720
um a member of the foundation and i am

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,959
uh you know my first love i'm still

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,080
engaged in the apache http server

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,680
project

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,640
uh aside from that you know i love

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,760
talking about open source i love uh

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,840
maybe sharing some of the things that

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,040
i've learned that maybe

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,319
could potentially benefit others

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,480
and you'll see that actually is a big

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,599
motivation for why

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,879
i kind of did this sort of thing

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,720
a couple years ago uh so

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,640
diving right into it let's talk about

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,120
motivations like why would you

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,080
or me or whoever want to give an open

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,200
source

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,560
class like what would you uh what would

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,920
you what would move you in that

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,040
direction and

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,000
for me the thing that really um i think

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,480
is helpful

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,080
uh is think about how you yourself

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,360
learned about open source how did you

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,280
get engaged

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,959
right did you did you have a mentor that

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,320
showed you the ropes somebody that

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,519
pointed you in the direction and said

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,440
hey why don't you consider

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,639
getting involved here it looks good on

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,880
your resume or

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,960
you can establish a really great network

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,560
or whatever the reasons

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,160
that should be motivation for you to do

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,680
the same thing right

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,880
um did you self-guide and maybe stumble

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,680
or have some of the

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,600
uh some some challenges that's another

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,120
motivation right maybe the next person

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,800
shouldn't have to stumble or maybe the

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,600
next person would love to learn from the

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,639
lessons

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,199
you learn the hard way which is kind of

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,280
the next one right we've all

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,280
i'd say we've all stubbed our toe in

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,680
some way shape or form

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,280
engaging in open source or engaging in

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,199
communities or even

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,560
simple things just like you know

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,240
contributing

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,960
um that's a great way to motivate people

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,880
but not necessarily to motivate them to

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,800
to learn the hard way

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,560
but for me if i learn something the hard

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,039
way i always try to think of

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,160
uh that next force app that is trying to

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,560
uh

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,759
do the same thing and hopefully doesn't

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,600
have to learn it the hard way

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,800
the other thing and i mentioned about

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,199
this earlier

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,880
um open source is a passion for me i'm

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,160
i'm very happy to see that we

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,639
as uh as an industry or as a movement or

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,039
as

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,479
whatever you'd want to call us today uh

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,320
open source isn't

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,759
necessarily a bunch of barefooted

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,680
hippies that are

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,520
you know on the fringes of society it's

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,479
very clear that open source is here to

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,240
stay

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:50,320
uh and that kind of passion that i have

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,440
uh it continues fueling it and what's

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,759
what's really interesting

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,680
is because open source has entered the

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,400
common lexicon people have heard of it

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,280
people

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,960
know a thing or two about it um it's

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,840
much more likely that you'd be able to

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,280
latch on

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:09,280
to that interest to to

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,280
deliver your own passion right

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,520
so for me myself

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,720
i appreciate training and mentoring and

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,160
teaching people

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:23,280
uh obviously there's a philanthropic

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,280
angle uh it feels good to give back and

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,840
and then building the community um look

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,240
you know

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,840
i i'm gonna repeat a line from uh from

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,560
rich bowen that he said a number of

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,400
times

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,080
i have personally gotten so much more

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,000
out of my involvement

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,720
with the apache software foundation and

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,440
with open source than

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,639
i have ever received so it's good to

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,880
deliver that right

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,360
it's good to sorry that i have ever

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,720
given back it's good to return that

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,599
uh and you know what's interesting let

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,720
me let me just use a quick word about

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:58,000
um the passion and about just sometimes

00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,280
you just gotta let things happen um

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,080
it was apache con denver and

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,240
what year was that maybe 2012 uh

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,360
somebody can toss it into the chat if uh

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,280
if they recall

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,880
and and we were actually uh doing what's

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,639
called an unconference

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,160
and and unconferences you know you just

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,400
get together and you talk about whatever

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,919
you want to talk about um

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,400
what was really interesting while we

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,639
were talking in the unconference

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,800
one of the individuals in the conference

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,639
said you know i didn't even hear about

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,280
open source i'd never heard it

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,720
until after i graduated from university

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,000
and we all kind of took a step back and

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,440
said that's crazy how does

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,199
you know how does that happen you know

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,759
we are living it uh

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,520
so you know that really struck me really

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,919
really struck me and it was

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,440
kind of funny here's the circumstances i

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,639
came back to work

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,960
after coming from apache con and on that

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:52,080
monday monday sending in my inbox was an

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:55,919
email from the dean of the

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,680
information systems department

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,720
from my alma mater asking if i'd be

00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,680
willing to write a letter of

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,879
recommendation my

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,560
my college mentor was uh he was

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,919
going up for tenure uh he was being

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,680
nominated for an award

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,520
so he said hey would you write a letter

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,240
i said i would be delighted to write a

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,160
letter

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,759
you know by the way do you ever talk to

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,759
your students about open source

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,199
and that's how this thing started just

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,319
asking that simple question

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:24,560
question uh just asking that you know

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:27,360
opening that door is really how this

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,120
unfolded right how i ended up uh

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,560
teaching a class it was

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,840
uh the answer was no we don't really

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,519
talk about open source do you know

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,039
anything about that because i think my

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,719
students would like to hear it

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,240
i said yeah i'd know a thing or two

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,760
let's you know let's talk

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:46,320
and it grew from there

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,959
apache denver was in 2014.

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,959
thank you gavin

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,440
i say denver it might have been austin i

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,040
don't remember

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,800
so let's talk about the hard thing the

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,800
the really hard part about

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,480
delivering an open source curriculum is

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,440
really designing the curriculum itself

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,519
this is where

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,720
this is a big surprise for me it totally

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,600
took me off guard

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,399
uh because i figured you know hey we'll

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,120
just kind of

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,320
show up we'll talk about open source

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,040
it's going to be great it's going to be

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,720
awesome

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,959
and what i realized very quickly is that

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,800
when you when you give a class you're

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,920
signing up for

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,320
x number of 50 minutes or sometimes hour

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,440
and a half long presentations

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,680
uh and that that kind of hit me

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,120
you know the hard way and i took a step

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,640
back and said okay we'll shoot

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,320
how are we going to do this what are we

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,320
going to do um

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,240
oh actually you know what i'm running

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,720
down the path let me let me take a step

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,399
back

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,839
where might you teach this class or

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:50,240
where might you do this

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:52,560
um it can be difficult to find a start

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,080
as i kind of mentioned the the start

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,519
landed in my lap

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,800
keep an eye out for that sort of thing

00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,240
use your personal network in your

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,720
professional network

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,200
another way to do this uh and this is

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,399
actually

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,040
how i got involved in the

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,560
i forget the name of the uh uh the

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,600
programming club at one of the local

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,760
colleges but

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,160
i showed up one day to talk about the

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,399
apache software foundation to give the

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,360
apache way presentation and it just kind

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,920
of grew from there

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,839
right you you you gain the interest

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,519
people ask more questions you say well

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,040
hey i can come back you know

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,240
hey i could do a lunch and learn or

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,240
maybe something like that for your

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,360
faculty what do you think

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,480
another great way to do this is

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,000
speak at a conference just like this so

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,519
i'll tell you what here i'll make a deal

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,240
we have a handful of people now in the

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,360
session

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,200
everybody here uh is going to use my

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,440
call to action of going out and they're

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,160
going to try to

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,240
land a job as an adjunct instructor for

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,279
one semester teaching a class

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,640
and next year i'd love to see you guys

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,120
present here

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,399
on how you did it right that'll be the

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,880
uh that'll be the goal

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,480
i see rob thompson he's already starting

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,480
he's already working on it so

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,320
that's going to be great rob i would

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,839
love to hear about your experiences and

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,680
please reach out use me as a resource

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,600
so anyhow back to talking about

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,399
curriculum this is the hard part

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,279
uh and believe it or not there is

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,480
actually some

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:25,760
open source data open source

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,959
information uh that you can use right

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,480
uh stand on the shoulders of giants i

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,680
structured my class

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,519
i structured the curriculum heavily on

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,959
channey yoon's open source class that

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,959
you can see on the google code

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,959
site that he operates there's also a

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,120
terrific

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,640
amount of just really good open source

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,920
documentation

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,959
uh right here in the community track

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,600
which we're hanging out in

00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,600
community.apache.org

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,240
that's a great place to start browsing

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,920
and things that seem interesting to you

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,519
and then i'd be remiss if i didn't

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,880
mention carl's excellent book about

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,760
producing open source

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,360
it's it's free to download your students

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,279
will love you if you use this as a

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,880
textbook for your class because

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:15,680
you don't have to go spend you know 200

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,920
or whatever the current charge is for a

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,920
book

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,760
so starting with that information

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,800
some of the things that you really want

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,120
to hit uh keep the schedule kind of

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,399
in mind uh think about where the

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,480
semester breaks are

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,560
think about uh you know you have your

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,480
big areas to focus on

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,240
what are the things that build on

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,040
previous topics uh

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,240
and one of the things that will uh you

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,760
know maybe stand alone

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,360
that you know you might be able to slide

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,680
that into the schedule just before

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,760
semester break or something like that

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,880
um a really critical thing i've taught

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,800
this session

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,279
i've taught the open source type class

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,240
to two sizes of classes i've had 30

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,240
students and i've had

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,839
seven students depending on your style

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,120
depending on how you'd like to give the

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,440
session

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,519
you're gonna tweak a couple of things

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,639
right if you have a larger class

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:15,839
or maybe even a very interactive group

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,600
uh consider bringing guest speakers um

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,320
you know i mentioned rich earlier he he

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,000
came and actually spoke at one of my

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,680
one of my sessions as a guest speaker

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,079
and the students loved it

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,680
in fact i think rich we invited the

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,680
whole information systems

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,200
programming club to that one i think we

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,760
had a few extra participants

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,320
also consider especially if you're using

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,240
a uh

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,760
a textbook you know to prepare your

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,560
readings in advance

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,160
uh a great reading that i like to ask

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,079
students to take a look at

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,240
is the cathedral and bazaar right a lot

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,580
of us have read that book it's a it's a

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,440
really good introduction

00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:56,320
[Music]

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,519
the other thing one of the requirements

00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,120
i had when i was

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,720
delivering the course of washington

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,199
university is we really wanted the

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,320
students

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:06,800
also to engage in a project of their own

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,680
some of the students actually open

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,680
source their project

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,199
i think we in the industry we tend to

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,800
call those abandonware because after

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,279
they graduated they didn't maintain it

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,519
but

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,120
you know whatever um but this was

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,000
actually an interesting dynamic for us

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,240
because we also

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,839
asked the students to present uh you

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,399
know we were we're in the school of

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,880
business

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:31,920
at um st louis and i made it a point to

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,519
let folks know hey when you get out into

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,279
the big world of business or when you

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,120
get out into industry you're going to be

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,519
asked to do some presentations you're

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,120
going to be asked to

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,360
you know talk to maybe non-technical

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,199
folks prep for that

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,800
i think that is invaluable for students

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:50,399
to do so consider that

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,279
uh you know it maybe isn't so much fun

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,920
for them

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,160
but you know balance fun versus what

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,920
they need

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,160
another thing to consider how are you

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,040
going to measure a student's success how

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,360
are you going to know

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,079
that your student is they're getting it

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,160
right

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:10,800
uh it's you know it it's super easy

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,360
i i say it's hard to grade based on

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,959
memory

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,560
uh and i say it's hard because you're

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,760
not really necessarily getting a good

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,480
evaluation

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,680
uh if you're basing strictly on memory

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,079
you're not necessarily

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,639
understanding if the student like gets

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:27,279
it if they truly understand the concepts

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,399
uh or if they're just you know reading

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,320
the study guide

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,639
and repeating it and regurgitating it up

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,360
onto the test itself

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,040
so think about how you might evaluate

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,839
the students and what i usually did in

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,079
those cases i would ask leading

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,480
questions

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,079
and interact more with the students

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,920
obviously that's going to work really

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,560
well in a small class size

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,639
not so much in a really big class size

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,399
unless you set aside some individual

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,480
time for your students

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,040
so think about different ways that you

00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,000
could uh evaluate the students right i

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,639
tossed a few criteria up on the screen

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,639
um you know again most of the folks that

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,240
are in the room we've met

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,360
you know i'm very interactive i like to

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,240
talk i use my hands when i speak

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,040
participation was really big for me so i

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,680
would often

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,560
drag students into the discussion to

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,519
kind of gauge

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,279
in real time their understanding because

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,399
it you know provided me the value of

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,560
knowing

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,920
is the material i'm presenting being

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,440
understood or

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,160
you know able to be reflected by the

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,040
student do i need to adjust how i do it

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,839
or is timmy just not awake and i need to

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,160
wake him up and pull him into the

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,720
conversation

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,639
um so that's that's another area right

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,680
so the curriculum's one part and then

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,320
evaluations is another area to kind of

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,320
keep in mind

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:52,720
so let me talk about what i've done

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,600
uh at least with with the session or the

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,920
the uh

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,000
the classes that i've given um the

00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,880
curriculum contents are things that i

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,320
think are

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,799
um you know like i said super important

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,600
uh and and what i've done effectively

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,120
for

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:12,640
uh based on uh previous examples right

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:15,280
uh i've taken this this

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,640
basic syllabus and fleshed it out into

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,319
different lesson plans

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,480
and i'm gonna do something that they

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:24,319
tell you never to do i'm gonna do a

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:27,520
a live demo all right you ready

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:30,720
i have the screen open

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,840
here is the github repo it's very simple

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,200
um hop in here take a look around this

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,600
is actually something that

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,520
uh thank you to the apache community

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,480
development project

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,679
i shared on the cop com dev list a

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,120
couple of years ago

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,120
that hey i'm looking to put this

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,760
together and a number of people stopped

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,200
in

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,120
you know they popped into the repo you

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,160
can see that we have 29 contributors

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,080
people have made

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,200
you know suggestions people have made

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,840
improvements

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,600
a lot of typos have been corrected i

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,960
even gave my students bonus points if

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,280
they corrected anything that was

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,679
factually incorrect

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,360
but you can see two iterations of the

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,760
syllabus here

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,760
so poke around in there the interesting

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,240
part really i think is the lecture notes

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,039
where

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,240
we you know we take a single topic and

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,679
build it out into an

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,919
outline of how that class will be

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:26,080
delivered

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:28,160
so i'll put it back over here um

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,440
again these these are real world

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,400
examples that have worked for me that

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,919
worked for

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,400
you know the students they have they

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,919
have actually worked in other contexts

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,840
uh i've given some of these sessions i

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,679
assume a lot of folks here are

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,640
participating in training programs at

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,960
work

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,200
um there have been times where we might

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,640
have interns come along or

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,400
you know junior folks that are trying to

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,240
understand what is

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,320
cicd uh and i always refer back to these

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,760
lesson plans it's just you know let's

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,799
kind of talk about those things

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,760
uh let's let's take this and run through

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,120
it and then

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,880
you know maybe there are new questions

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,559
or something that you know i

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,160
hadn't considered before i always kind

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,840
of feed it back into

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,840
those markdown files

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,919
so as i mentioned you know that that's a

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,160
good skeleton use it

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,919
it's it's yours you're going to deliver

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,919
this class and i want it to be as

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,200
simple and easy process as possible for

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,280
you

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,880
consider also adding or subtracting

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,559
guest speakers

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,400
and readings i mentioned the cathedral

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,960
in a bizarre

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,320
classic classic document that you know

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,880
very early days of open source

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,720
i mentioned guest speakers i actually in

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,520
our in the first iteration of the class

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,080
we had

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,880
guest speakers on the opposite ends of

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,120
the spectrum

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,880
kind of give their perspective uh one

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,480
person talking about

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,160
you know the benefits or the reasons

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,919
that open source is you know

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,200
you should do open source because it is

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,799
just good to do

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,360
and then on the other side we had a

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,520
person uh present and say you should do

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,360
open source because you get free labor

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,799
and it's a business decision

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,159
uh it's very interesting differing

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,039
opinions

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,640
for the students to hear so consider

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:15,200
that sort of thing

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,280
i'll again point out i i'm more than

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,960
happy to

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,720
present give guidance i can even connect

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,120
those interested with some of my own

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,440
network if they would like to

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,400
do this sort of thing so you know like i

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,559
said

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,000
use me as a reference or a resource and

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,440
i'm happy to refer you to

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,600
other folks that might be able to

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,039
augment the open source class that you

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,320
might give

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,880
because i don't know if i'll be able to

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,640
do this again i you know recently

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,080
took a new role and it's been super busy

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,640
so

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,080
somebody carry the torch right

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,679
so i'd normally kind of pause for

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,880
questions but uh

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,240
you know i'm talking to a camera uh and

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,159
many friends of mine are on the other

00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,919
end of the camera but uh it's not as

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,440
interactive so i'll just kind of plow

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,000
through and then when we get to the end

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,600
you know open

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,240
for uh whatever you have in mind

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,440
so i've kind of grabbed a few things

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,720
that i think are very

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:15,919
very important topics to consider

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,880
i think i have two sides of these the

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,000
the first and

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,400
i think the probably the most important

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,240
arguably to give students a true

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,240
appreciation of open source is the

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,880
history of open source

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,360
when you look at the different reasons

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,039
people

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,200
started doing or are doing open source

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,400
there are you know four discrete

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,760
different reasons

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,559
i'll leave it as a uh an exercise for

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,200
the reader to take a look at the

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,000
syllabus to see what those four reasons

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,760
are but

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,120
you know getting getting students

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,120
familiar with that history

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,960
uh i think provides a richness and a

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,400
very good foundation to build the rest

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,799
of this

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,240
um moving further you know we also need

00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,200
to remember that we have to teach our

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,880
students

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:05,360
concrete hard skills uh tooling

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,799
guys you know we we in the open source

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,080
world have invented

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,200
tooling to augment our ability to

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,840
deliver software

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,799
think about it source control build

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,960
management

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,600
bugs and issue trackers these are things

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,159
that any software development student

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,919
any business student even will need to

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,840
understand and have some sort of

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,400
exposure to so these are things that

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,280
really need to be in place uh they

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,919
really should

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,840
you know highlight or have a highlighted

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,280
spot within the curriculum

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,960
and i'll talk a little bit more about

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,600
one of the reasons why that's the case

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,600
in my mind

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,559
depending on what area your students are

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,720
studying

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,480
uh the different development processes

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,440
might be important to cover

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,080
right i found that the students are

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,840
totally

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,120
on board they totally get the whole

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,000
kanban

00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,240
uh kind of thought process when i when i

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,760
tried to explain to them waterfall they

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,440
got a little confused and they said that

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,159
sounds awful so i guess we as an

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,919
industry are

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:09,679
you know progressing well at that front

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,440
it's also important especially if your

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,840
students will be participating in open

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,919
source

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,919
to talk about development best practices

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,679
there will be times that they might go

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,760
back to contribute

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,880
and depending on the community they are

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,559
engaging in

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,640
they may not have a good experience if

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,320
they forgot to update the readme

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,600
i'll let you fill in the blanks on what

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,760
that might mean for some of the

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,280
communities that are out there but

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,039
they should definitely understand these

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,840
things

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,200
and then a favorite topic i think this

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,919
is important

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,440
for open source um it's obviously

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,360
critical to the apache software

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,559
foundation so maybe that kind of slants

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,159
my view

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,080
let's talk about communities let's talk

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,840
about governance let's talk about how do

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,120
things happen within the different

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,440
projects

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,880
this is an entire hour and a half long

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,279
session sometimes

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,640
two hours that you can you can run

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,120
through here with your students

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,039
and uh it's interesting because when we

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,559
started talking about that

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,480
uh communities and governance

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,480
particularly and then licenses as well

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,880
the students were very fascinated

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,400
i was surprised by how interested they

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,159
were in some of the

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,360
softer side of the uh the platform

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:23,919
um rather than some of the hard you know

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:27,520
technical skills like source control

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,960
and things like that um

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,400
getting involved is another important

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,000
one and that that kind of feeds into

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,039
communities and governance i would tend

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,360
to recommend

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,039
teaching communities and governments so

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,559
people can understand you know the way i

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,559
get involved with

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,000
uh an open governance model is going to

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,880
be very different from the way i get

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,520
involved with

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,840
a open source closed governance type of

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:51,200
model that makes sense

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:55,679
uh and i found that hands-on labs and

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,039
doing even goofy exercises that you know

00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,880
in the grand scheme of things don't

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,760
necessarily matter but

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,360
using some of the tools that's a really

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,919
important thing to do get

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,480
get the students on the keyboard trying

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:11,919
some of these things out because

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,240
um you'll be surprised at how

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,559
sometimes they have issues with some of

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,679
the tooling

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,919
so i'm going to jump to the next slide

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,039
before i before i touch on that sharon

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,559
asked a good question

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,440
so developers are getting younger and

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:29,679
younger is there a minimum age

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,480
i would recommend a class for and i'm

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,440
going to say

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,880
no i wouldn't really have a minimum age

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,320
because

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,720
you'd be the judge right you know your

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,039
audience better than i would it may be a

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,880
bit

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:45,120
long you know not lost

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,520
it probably wouldn't be effective use of

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,600
time to teach 11 year olds about

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,039
license and open source and intellectual

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,320
property legal

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:57,039
implications um but they're

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,240
definitely going to be interested in uh

00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,840
logical flows

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,000
right how do you how do you make

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,039
computers do stuff like that

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,039
so i my my opinion would be

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,559
find ways to work open source into any

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,200
audience uh

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,960
you'll find it you'll understand it um

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,520
i've had to explain to my kids a handful

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,720
of times

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,520
why why i engage in open source what am

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,200
i doing

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,520
why what is that black screen with the

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,760
white text what is all that stuff

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,520
dad talk to me um and they've been

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,960
receiving those questions as young as

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,799
you know eight or nine years old so um

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,600
i don't know if we ever really got into

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,400
the uh intrinsic motivational factors

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,640
that you would see

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,960
in you know a public good type of

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,799
charity contribution

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,480
but at least the interest was there so i

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,600
would say expose the students early to

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,520
it

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:53,360
for a full-on curriculum i would suggest

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:56,559
no sooner than high school probably um

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,480
10th 10th or 11th grade

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,480
at a minimum because you know there's a

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,880
lot of complex topics that we would

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,760
cover

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:07,039
if we were doing an entire semester on

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,120
open source

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,559
um so think about additional things that

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,760
you might work into your curriculum

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,559
uh this is where it gets kind of

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,679
interesting um

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,840
for a team project this is uh

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,080
this will fit in very well with just

00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,799
about any computer science curriculum i

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,240
remember my

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:29,600
capstone class of my of my

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,840
undergraduate degree was to design

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,480
and deploy an actual system for a real

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,880
world client

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,240
that can be the underlying theme or the

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,480
the backbone i would say

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,880
of what you need to do in the class but

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,399
then as you work on that you can expose

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,440
and teach students all of these open

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,559
source topics

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,799
that's actually what we did at

00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,520
washington university when i did the

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,120
session

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,640
uh there is we would we would kind of

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,000
set milestones

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,399
and we would have the students kind of

00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,320
self-govern their team projects

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:03,440
but then the bulk of class time was

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,360
spent we had our 15 minute classes

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,520
the bulk of class time was spent talking

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,600
about these open source concepts

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,240
exposing the students to them gauging

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:17,120
their understanding and things like that

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:19,840
um the the caution that i'll give you is

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,840
uh be careful uh on overloading students

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,440
and i kind of mention this here

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:27,279
um if you're going to give them a very

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,679
heavy duty project that they need to

00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,840
complete by the end of the semester

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,159
you may have to kind of take the easy

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:37,279
way out on some of your evaluations for

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,200
open source understanding

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,120
cognitive overload is a real thing and

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,320
we don't want to burn our students out

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,880
and of course at the end of the day we

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,159
want everybody to succeed

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,320
um a thing i strongly suggest

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,679
for any student is giving individual

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,360
presentations

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:57,360
um two that i've i've had students do

00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,039
uh is you know tell me about your

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,840
favorite open source project

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,080
and i made it you know the the criteria

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,679
and

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,080
you'll see this in some of the the

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:09,440
syllabi that are up on the page

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,600
um i made it about open source as well

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,799
tell me about the project now what is

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,360
that project's

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,640
governance model how does that project

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,360
sustain itself through

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,840
contributions through funds uh what's

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,320
the licensing that that project has

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,960
tell me things about that and that can

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,440
also

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,880
serve not just not just the the horrible

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,080
thing that a lot of us hated in

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,960
secondary school of giving presentations

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,720
but it also kind of causes students to

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,640
internalize some of these concepts that

00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,760
they're hearing as they talk about

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,360
their particular project one of my

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,960
favorite ones and i'll tell you

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,640
generally in my experience

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,799
this is usually a miss more than a hit

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,039
with students is how do

00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,880
how do you make money with open source

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,960
um there are a couple of different valid

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,600
models out there

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,360
i think either i didn't do a great job

00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,840
of explaining them to the students or

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,679
maybe

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,200
that's a little obscure of a topic to

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,559
have them present on

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,080
but it was a fun exercise nonetheless

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,159
and then you know i'm gonna work this in

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:14,080
here writing assignments

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,440
um at some point

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,679
in all of our careers we're gonna have

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,159
to explain something technical or

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,919
complicated in a non-complicated way

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,279
that is a muscle that everybody should

00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,200
learn and build

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,520
uh it doesn't necessarily have anything

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,039
to do with open source per se

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,200
but that is something that we do need to

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,200
be teaching the next generation

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,399
i think it was einstein maybe was who

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,159
said uh

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,559
if you can't explain it simply then you

00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:41,039
don't understand it well enough

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:43,760
feel free to correct that citation i i

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,760
think that's correct

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,399
so giving the curriculum i wanted to

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,000
cover a couple of things that were

00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:53,200
surprising and not surprising

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,039
and then surprising for the students the

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,799
things that are not surprising i'm going

00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,080
to say them to make sure that you hear

00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:01,679
them and they're in

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,919
uh black or grayish and white

00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,519
students don't always do the readings

00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,120
and sometimes they don't show up for

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,039
class

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,120
it can be hard to gauge that until it's

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,480
a little too late for example if you are

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,200
setting a

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,960
schedule for your lecture or you're

00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,000
planning for an interactive session with

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,840
the students

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,840
and you get 20 minutes in and you

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,200
realize nobody has done the required

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,799
reading and they have no idea what

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,320
you're talking about

00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:32,799
uh you'll have to deal with that right

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,559
be aware of that have a backup plan

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,720
i assume we've all kind of been there

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,600
before where maybe we didn't do the best

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,360
of uh

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,360
keeping up on the required readings

00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:46,399
the other unsurprising thing is you know

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,559
many students i would say most have not

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:52,240
really been exposed to open source

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:53,919
what is it really right i mean people

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,240
i think people generally understand open

00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,360
source means i can go get this free as

00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,519
in beer

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,039
um they may not understand the whole

00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,600
free isn't free speech

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,200
type of thing but uh generally speaking

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,720
they they don't necessarily know the

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,039
whole ecosystem this is a

00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,799
vast and vibrant ecosystem so that

00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:13,600
shouldn't be too surprising

00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:15,519
uh and that's why we're here right we we

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,120
are going to teach this next generation

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,720
about this ecosystem

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,760
and rob's going to tell me all about it

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,600
next year um

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,200
it's also a little difficult to find the

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,480
right mix between in-class and

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,360
out-of-class learning

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,919
this is like required readings or

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,200
writing

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,840
outside of class versus you talking with

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,120
the students

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,360
during class again my personal style is

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:43,200
i like a very conversational

00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:46,640
uh type of presentation so

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,720
i i tend to just use the notes

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,919
right that you'll find in the uh the

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,559
syllabus

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,600
um or in the lecture notes i should say

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,279
and then we just kind of take the

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,320
conversation wherever it goes you use

00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:00,320
the notes as a

00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:03,120
skeleton uh the other part and this is

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,640
this is just the fact of learning

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,000
students will miss nuances

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,519
something that you and i take for

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,440
granted or we just intrinsically

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,240
understand

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,480
they don't necessarily understand yet

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,760
why that is significant so it

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,679
can fly right by them repetition will be

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,480
important

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,919
what was surprising for me and these are

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,720
some of the things that i wanted to

00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,320
share

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:30,080
um learning git is actually quite hard

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,519
for first timers actually any form of

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,080
version control

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,960
um if you if you think back to your days

00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,240
as a

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,039
university student um or if you got

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,840
engaged in

00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:43,440
software development before that i don't

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,200
know about you guys but i saved all

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,120
these files locally on my disk and

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,240
sometimes i would copy them to a server

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,360
but this whole

00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:54,480
commit a chain of commits

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,600
and a repository that holds these and

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,960
other people working

00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,200
what that was insane um students

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,240
this the students have have consistently

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,360
struggled with this

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,000
uh so i i definitely suggest lab

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,240
time you know repetition you know

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,960
talking about version control

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,639
is definitely something that not just is

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,280
important it's a hard skill that is

00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,800
required these days

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,040
you will need to spend some extra

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,119
attention on some topics

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,480
i mentioned earlier in the session make

00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,560
sure you save

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,079
you know save an empty class or two

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,800
because there will be things that need

00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,679
to spill

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,960
and you may need to you know kind of

00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,960
juggle the schedule

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,560
just a little bit to make sure you give

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,560
something appropriate coverage

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,359
it was also kind of surprising to me if

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,800
you are very open and transparent about

00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:50,079
how you will grade

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,919
students will deliver exactly according

00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:55,359
to the grade

00:34:51,919 --> 00:35:00,160
which can be unexpected

00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,160
right keep that in mind

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,320
finally the other thing that i i thought

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,040
was kind of surprising generally

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,560
speaking the

00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:13,119
students even in the senior year uh of a

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:14,560
software engineering type of degree um

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,400
they they don't necessarily understand

00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,839
the full software development life cycle

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,760
so i will uh i will definitely recommend

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,240
covering the life cycle of software

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,359
development from

00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,640
conceptualization all the way to release

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,320
and then day two

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,280
you know issues and tracking and stuff

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,800
like that

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,040
so i did want to share a couple of

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,400
things that i i gathered were surprising

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,200
for the students and most of these are

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,079
great

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,880
um open source is more than github this

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,800
is something that

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,000
you know i consistently can kind of see

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,760
it dawn

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
on the students faces as we would talk

00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,320
about these concepts and they're like

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,200
oh it's just not a place that people

00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,560
don't code

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:58,240
cool let's learn more about this

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,359
um the other thing i found really

00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,520
fascinating

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,640
so i've taught this this session in the

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,680
school of business

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:09,280
and in the school of computer science

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:11,200
and consistently these uh these students

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,079
have been very interested in licensing

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,599
and intellectual

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:18,240
property it was it was a

00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,920
very interesting conversation when we

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,599
got around to licenses it was funny the

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,480
first time i taught the class

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,160
when i would reference the licenses talk

00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,680
i would always say that talk that you

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,040
guys are going to fall asleep in

00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,040
and it turned out to be the exact

00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,640
opposite the students were super engaged

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,119
they were really interested

00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,760
uh they challenged a lot of the you know

00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,880
uh

00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,280
things that they heard um so i would say

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,520
as

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,880
as you give your sessions make sure that

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,800
you're pretty well buttoned up on that

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,880
particular area because the level of

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,079
engagement for licensing and ip was

00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,520
was really cool um

00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,359
another thing that was kind of

00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,839
surprising for students i would say

00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,880
is writing for a non-technical manager

00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:00,160
is hard

00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,599
you know it's i i think this is maybe

00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,040
the third time in this session

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,680
particularly that i've kind of called

00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,359
this out

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,119
this is a skill that they will need to

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:09,920
build muscle for and

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,520
i guess it's it's easy to kind of

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,560
internalize it

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,960
but to repeat back in a way that maybe

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,000
isn't uh understood to the level that

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,880
you have

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
that's the challenge uh and then finally

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,480
of course the most

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,040
uh exciting thing that i saw students

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,960
pick up and exciting you know for me

00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,800
is that students realize that they can

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,359
participate to open source

00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,320
uh guys one of one of the most rewarding

00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:37,440
things

00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,240
i i experienced during delivery of this

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,200
course

00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,920
is uh you know i i can see his face i

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,160
can i can

00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,400
remember the tone in his voice when he

00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,880
shared at the beginning of class that

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,000
he fixed the documentation bug in his

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,160
favorite javascript

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,760
library and he never would have thought

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,200
to do that if it weren't for

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,400
the fact that we talked about these

00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,800
things so he fixed the documentation bug

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,640
of course you know being who i am i

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,440
announced that the whole class everybody

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,839
clapped and

00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,320
you could just sense the moment of pride

00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,920
so that was really cool and to see the

00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,920
students kind of pick that up and get

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,359
that they can do that

00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:17,040
very very great wrapping up fairly

00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,520

the passion

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,359
uh the experience anything along those

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,040

00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:36,000
happen

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,760
build upon the foundation that i i won't

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,119
even say that i have provided because i

00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,400
built upon

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:45,359
existing curriculum let's do this

00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,400
the way we do open source software let's

00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,640
keep building

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,520
and the next iteration will be that much

00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,920
better

this is apache con you know we're all

00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,320
about community over code

00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,920
this is how you can give back to the

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,599
community the things that you have

00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,599
learned sometimes through a mentor

00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,920
sometimes through

00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,440
the hard way you can give back to the

00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,880
next generation

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:13,200

mindfulness and

00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,680
managing burnout and i think if there's

ever a time

00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,280
uh it's now that we should all think

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,760
about those things

00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,760
for shouting

00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,720

00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,520
destroyed itself in the background
