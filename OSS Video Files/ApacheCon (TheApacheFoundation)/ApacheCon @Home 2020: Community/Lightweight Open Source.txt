Ever think about contributing to the Open Source world, but worried that - for some reason or another - it’s not up to par with playing with the “big boys and girls”? That’s BS! Come learn why *every* contribution in the Open Source world can be helpful! As an active participant in the Open Source community for over twenty years, I am constantly running into situations where prospective newcomers to the community feel daunted and undervaluating themselves and/or their contributions. In this session I’ll talk about the importance of that exact sort of small contribution in some of the biggest Open Source communities and projects out there. Because sometimes a sub-domain expert is *much* more vital than yet another domain expert.

Issac has been involved in the Web community for nearly 20 years. With a strong background in the Apache Web Server internals, and optimizing web applications, Issac continues to churn out highly optimized web applications in a variety of languages and servers, as well as mentoring teams of programmers to be as passionate about writing great software as he is. Today Issac is married with four kids, and is launching a start-up to chase his long time dream: turning smart homes into a day-to-day "taken for granted" reality. In his spare time, he still spends time volunteering in the tech community and mentoring hi-tech teams across a diverse range of languages and disciplines.
