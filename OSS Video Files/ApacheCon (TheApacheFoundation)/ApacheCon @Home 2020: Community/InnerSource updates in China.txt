Description: 
	InnerSource updates in China
Jerry Tan

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

There are more and more projects donated to Apache foundation from China in recent years. So more engineers are familiar with Apache Way. InnerSource is adopting Apache Way with an organization. And then More companies are beginning their InnerSource Journey. In this talk, I will give a brief update of InnerSource adoption in China, including some company's practices. Some are using it to build engineer culture, some are using it as a tool to remove duplicate wheels. InnerSource is a long journey, but I am happy to see that Chinese companies are more willing to embrace Open Source more deeply.

i will give some updates on inner source

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,920
in china

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,439

over 20 years experience with open

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,240
source software and open source

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,880
community

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,119
i'm a commuter of mozilla gloom and

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,400
apache software foundation

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:38,880
i was a former open source mid albedo

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,159
company am an advocator of inner source

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,439
in china

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:46,399
and i also the organizer of inner source

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,399
china working group

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:54,079
here is my agenda first i'll talk about

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,600
what is inner source then i will

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,880
introduce

00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,799
inner source working group in china

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,640
then i'll get some update from the

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,240
members and the

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,599
updates from our ost channel and update

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:14,319
from is summit

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,319
not a summer up and questions

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:22,560
okay so first what is inner source

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,160
inner source is the use of open source

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,599
software development the best

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,000
parentheses

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,040
and the statement of open source net

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,239
culture

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,400
within organizations the organization

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,519
may still develop private priority

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,200
software

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:42,160
but internally opens up its development

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,120
i got this designation from wikipedia

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,200
it's a little

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,640
complicated to make it short

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,680
here's one inner source is a drop in the

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,280
apache way

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,319
inside an organization this definition

00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:02,080
is given by dennis cooper

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,400
she is the open source diva she's also

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,840
the creator of inertia's commerce

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:11,599
a community focused on inner source

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,599
i'll talk about it later

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,000
here is the history of inner source

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:23,519
in the year 2000 team already

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:27,040
founded a company focused on providing

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,879
open source consulting to some big

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,080
companies

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:35,440
he called it gated open source

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,440
or inner source

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,840
then dennis cooper

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:48,400
when she was the head of open source

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:53,280
in people in 2015

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:56,400
she promoting inner source again

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,840
to make it easy to search

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,840
he calls this item this term inner

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:07,200
source and she also created a community

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,200
called inner source commerce

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,040
so what is interesting commerce

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,239
innovative commerce

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:18,720
is a community with a goal of creating

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:23,759
and knowledge about inner source

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:27,759
it was founded in 2015 by danny cooper

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:31,040
she announced it in oscar

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,120
has summits twice a year

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,440
and it also provides some books and

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:40,000
videos

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:43,680
this is the local of this community

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,720
and there this is their books

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,600
publishing available to

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,600
inner source guys

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,759
this one is getting started with inner

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,360
source are talking in our source

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,040
and understanding the inner source

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,120
chinese

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:06,479
they are all uh sponsored by people

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,479
published by already

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,240
okay i'll talk about the inner source

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,560
updates in china

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,919
inner source channel working group has

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,120
been set up

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,120
and i will give some

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,280
updates over several companies who

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,320
adopted already

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,960
including huawei tencent baidu

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,960
and the dd

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:38,880
inner source channel working group

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,880
i'm the only online

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,759
there are 10 plus members there

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,720
that are from huawei tencent baidu

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,759
inspire

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:54,000
shooting dd we bank

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,000
high count and consistently

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,280
they are all

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,919
managers or the architectures

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,120
who we adopted in resort in their

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,840
company

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,120
we have regular online or offline

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,759
communications

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:17,840
to to discuss how to

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,840
practice inner source and their

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
experience

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,600
then i'll talk about some companies

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,720
practices

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:32,560
first is huawei huawei

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,980
is the most famous high-tech company

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,160
in china it has

00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:40,160
[Music]

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:44,080
over 90 000 engineers

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:47,840
in the year 2014 it begins

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,880
in also top down the original is too

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,280
simple

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,960
because there are many pro products and

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,240
projects intertwining each other

00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,840
so when there's some

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:05,120
problems about happens is

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:08,240
much harder for them to debug

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,599
so they think that if the code is

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,360
open internally the engineers can

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:18,720
read the code and can identify

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:22,080
quickly so they want to

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,080
make debug easier

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:30,080
that's their original reasons

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:34,080
here now ninety percent of projects

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,599
go to inner source they have available

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,880
practices

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:41,280
total top down and

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,400
they have very strict code security

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,400
process

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,400
to make it happen

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,520
now i'll talk about 10 cents

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,400
pension is one of the biggest internet

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,280
company in china

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,319
and also in the world it's the largest

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,680
social media

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:10,879
and social networking company in china

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,879
it has more than

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:18,560
20 some of the engineers

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:23,520
in the year 2012 it began to adopt

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,520
inner source bottom up original

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,960
because they want to promote engineering

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,080
culture

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:33,279
inside the company because

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,479
for engineers talking cheap sharing the

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,599
code

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:42,080
so they think that if engineers

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,880
open source desert code inside the

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,560
company

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:49,519
it will be very easy to identify

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,240
the high tenant people and this will

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,040
promote

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:57,160
engineering culture tier

00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:59,839
2018 there's

00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:02,399
34 percent of projects got

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,399
inner source

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,800
this is the first stage before september

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,320
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:16,480
and 2018 after that

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:20,399
a big change they promote inner source

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:23,600
top down because they found that

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,720
inner source can benefit their company

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,240
greatly

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:31,440
but if you only promote online resource

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:36,160
both of us they cannot

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:39,760
have great projects and great products

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,399
so they promoted top down the reason is

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,279
to

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,839
limited to joking the wheels inside the

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:49,360
company

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:52,720
tier 2020 80

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,600
percent project got intersourced

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,160
they put very strong resources on this

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,160
project

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,399
okay i'll talk about vital inner source

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,760
journey

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,640
i was the head of vital inner open

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,240
source

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:16,320
so i know it exactly

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:21,680
baidu is a large search engine in china

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:25,200
it has more than 10 sound engineers

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,000
from 2016

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,959
it adopts inner songs to improve their

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,200
internal

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:36,720
platforms here steps

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,160
in first they choose the first pilot

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,720
project

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:44,839
then we open up extended to

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,000
the whole department the first

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,839
department

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,640
then provided then we extend it to the

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,640
company wide

00:10:52,959 --> 00:11:00,000
here is the details the first project

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:04,800
is odp odp is a pp

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:08,240
framework used widely inside baidu

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:12,320
in the 2016 we began to

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,120
abduct inner source the original is very

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,320
simple

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:20,800
because the engineering resources

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:23,839
is too limited cannot handle too many

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,839
feature requests

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:32,079
at that time odp is based

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:35,279
it basis is using ph 55

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:38,640
but the php 7 has got released

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:41,920
and it becomes stable they want to

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:45,200
migrate this platform from pip

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:48,800
5 to php 7 but there are

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:52,240
many many plugins that work

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:55,120
on the php file but

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,000
this project has only two people two

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,200
engineers working

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:04,399
on this they cannot

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:07,760
migrate these plugins from pv5 to pp7

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:10,800
so how to do this they

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:14,000
in associate

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,240
they call contributors from the company

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,240
and

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:26,320
intensive contributor to test to code

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,320
to debug and to contribute patches

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:34,320
inner source after one year more than

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:38,560
200 engineers joined this project

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:41,920
they discussed the pro the test they

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:46,880
provide patches and review the patches

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,880
and got it in and release the package

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,680
we got more than 200 patches into the

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,120
project

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:58,399
and makes a team migrate

00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:02,240
to php7 very very

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,240
uh flows very

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,800
perfectly

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:15,720
then we moved to the first department

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:18,240
in info responsible for by those

00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,880
infrastructure services including

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,240
storage

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:27,279
and computing it

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,279
has more about 200 engineers

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:35,200
we got support from director managers

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:39,519
and developer leaders

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:42,399
the original is very simple the same

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,920
first they have limited engineering

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,839
resources

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,000
they cannot handle too many feature

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:52,079
requests

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,440
so they want their customers to

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:58,880
provide the passion requests instead of

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:02,079
feature requests and they want

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:05,279
also want to build stronger connections

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:07,920
with the inside customers

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,800
because if their customers can work

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,920
together

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,880
collaborate with each together provide

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,399
patch

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:21,760
to them then there will

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,760
their relationship will be much stronger

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,360
then we extended our inner source

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,720
journey

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:36,000
towards opening wide our ceo

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:40,720
promoted inner source same time to

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:43,040
bring them silos our cto requests

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,480
all platforms that serve for

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,920
company-wide

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,040
should be inner source and

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:54,320
our open source program office

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,120
and the leader of this request that

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,240
all projects need to be inner source

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,959
first

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,959
before open source to external community

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:11,279
here's the whole journey of

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,920
inner source okay

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,399
i will move we'll move to these inner

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,880
source

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,880
practices dd

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:27,800
is a chinese uber it begins

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:29,120
adopting inner source from

00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:33,199
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:36,399
last year the reason is to improve

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:39,040
collaboration and cultural use inside

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,040
the company

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:45,920
it is top-down and strong operations

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,040
the atmosphere inside the deepti are

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,199
good

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:54,320
neithers are happy engineers are happy

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:57,199
because atmospheres were great

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,560
and they still need a bloody project to

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:02,560
approve the

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,560
real value of inner source

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:12,560
okay i'll talk about some

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:16,800
companies the community of a china local

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:20,800
community or as china or has china

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,800
promoting inner source also

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,399
it's the biggest open source committee

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,600
in china

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,800
we if we can think that it's github each

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,920
other

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,120
they stamp special pages for inner

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,880
source

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:40,800
they introduced inner source

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:44,880
to chinese engineers

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,399
here's our website therefore papers like

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,000
this

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,440
this is the local of inner source

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,079
commerce

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,600
and although it collapsed many

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,720
documentations

00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:00,639
and they translated into chinese

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:04,400
simple chinese version and

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:08,160
presented to chinese engineers

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:11,120
including the definition of inner source

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,400
the best practice of inner source and

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,959
why

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:22,880
and how and how to

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,880
to how to approve the value

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:32,640
so sum up inner source

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:35,840
in china compiled with

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,720
open source in china in our source is

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,080
still

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:47,840
as the early adopter stage

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:47,840
is here

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:55,039
then i'll talk about isis summit winter

00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:58,160
00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:01,440
i see commerce have two

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,080
summits every year but this time it will

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,600
have a

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:09,200
special event called irc summer

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,360
winter event it will be hosted by

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,640

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,799
video

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,799
very clearly right

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:33,120
so uh

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,039
we can think about uh for pre-quality

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,440
video for

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,440
a non-native speaker it will help us

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
great

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:17,840
