A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

There are more and more projects donated to Apache foundation from China in recent years. So more engineers are familiar with Apache Way. InnerSource is adopting Apache Way with an organization. And then More companies are beginning their InnerSource Journey. In this talk, I will give a brief update of InnerSource adoption in China, including some company's practices. Some are using it to build engineer culture, some are using it as a tool to remove duplicate wheels. InnerSource is a long journey, but I am happy to see that Chinese companies are more willing to embrace Open Source more deeply.
