okay as he said Miami Sam Ruby I've been

00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:11,700
with the Apache Software Foundation for

00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:13,110
since 1999 so about 20 years today nine

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:18,180
ten happens to be a palindrome I

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:19,859
surprised no one else mentioned that has

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,810
it really been 20 years already I mean

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,400
it surprises me that it's been here this

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,720
long

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:29,880
phones were a little different different

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:32,700
then we were a bit different then you

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:37,050
might notice some slight changes at

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,850
least in my beard color I want to share

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,180
a little bit of the excitement that I

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,280
felt back then show of hands how many

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,840
people here have contributed to the

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,510
Apache Software Foundation in some way

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:53,449
sent a mail to a mailing list commit to

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:56,039
a code submitted an issue or whatever

00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:57,960
now I want to sort of do this oddly

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:02,059
universe drop your hand have you been

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:07,229
here 20 years or more 15 years or more

00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:09,450
10 years or more okay so people who have

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,159
still their hands up we've only been

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,400
here like five years or something what

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,619
I'd like to see is somebody who still

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,909
got their hands up not necessary in this

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,820
audience but somebody who would have

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:24,000
their hands up beyond the ASF Ford in

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:27,770
the next five years that is the

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,900
excitement of change in which I came to

00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:36,920
I'm sorry mother okay

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:43,640
it's at least sure okay just showing

00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:47,310
sometimes I made my first commit in 1999

00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,259
in 2001 I was accepting an award on

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,680
behalf of PHP as Co supported card that

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:56,909
PHP group by 2003 I was on the board of

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:59,969
directors of the Apache that isn't

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,320
unique other people have done it and I

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:03,260
met that I can even name a person who's

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,270
done it faster than me in the last

00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:12,800
ten years so it is possible this is what

00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:14,180
I'd like to see happen in the last 20

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,090
years we've gone quite a bit they talked

00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,490
about how there was 20 or so people the

00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:23,990
number of people contributing is now

00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:26,510
over 7,000 committers so it's not just

00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,760
critters we've grown a bit since then

00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:31,160
this is a number of projects we started

00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,470
with basically one project and we've

00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,580
been growing consistently over time the

00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:38,900
important thing to notice is these

00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:41,959
graphs of sort of a linear approach

00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:45,260
we're growing at a steady steady pace

00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:49,370
not exploding not going crazy and not

00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:51,350
tapering off we have a strong pipeline

00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,580
this is a sort of a busy chart and by

00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,200
the way all these charts are online you

00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,870
can find this this entire presentation

00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,390
online and this presentations got links

00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:02,090
to other places so you can chase all the

00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:05,450
links and find them my twitter handle

00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:08,570
with sam ruby s am r ub y from there you

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:11,600
can find it it's awfully at the ASF etc

00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:12,920
now I've links at the end but this is

00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,130
the pipeline of projects that are in

00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:20,140
their incubator where people projects

00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:22,850
come in BASF before they end up becoming

00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,440
projects and they may stay in there for

00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:27,470
months to possibly even a small number

00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,470
of years we have on the average

00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,810
somewhere around 40 ish projects in the

00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:34,370
incubator at any time so in large number

00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,470
of projects wanted to become part of the

00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:39,620
Apache Software Foundation and on their

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:41,810
way in during the last year we've got

00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,420
seven new projects open wisk is the

00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:48,110
latest there was a workshop yesterday in

00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:50,510
a presentation in this list NetBeans is

00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:53,090
huge and humongous it's sort of a quite

00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:56,390
a big addition to the foundation that

00:03:53,090 --> 00:04:01,610
happened during this past year not to

00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:07,489
make total statistics we've got over

00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:11,980
7,000 committers 765 members to our

00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:11,980
three committees managing 334 projects

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:35,070
and 48 incubating product paddling's as

00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,130
I said we've seemed to manage just about

00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:42,270
40-ish at any time and the current

00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:43,680
number is 48 this is sort of all the

00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,580
logos of all the projects that are

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,710
currently at the Apache Software

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,960
Foundation at time these charts right

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,570
charts I mean I don't expect any look

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,090
pull out any individual things and all

00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,350
again all these things are online the

00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,330
overall status the Apache Software

00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,460
Foundation continues to evolve innovate

00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,260
and lead by example

00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,450
lieutenant testament to our principles

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,930
that brought us the first 20 years the

00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,550
impact

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,260
Pachi Pachi communities the world and

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,640
never been greater many of the other

00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,760
foundations that would be mentioned

00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,410
today we're built after the Apache

00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,780
Software Foundation and many of them

00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:18,300
will explicitly state that they modeled

00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:21,150
themselves after the Apache Software

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:24,390
Foundation so we were there and people

00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:27,000
have noticed our success and built

00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:29,250
opponent and well-established and

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,990
flourishing bottom-up community-centric

00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:35,370
open-source project is my bottoms up we

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,310
have nine directors elected by the

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,690
membership the board does not oversee

00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,419
technical directions for projects that's

00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:46,830
not how Apache works set technical

00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:49,800
direction we do the board does prove new

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:52,050
projects and oversees all the projects

00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,940
and operations and no director has any

00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,440
ability to set more policy than any

00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,820
others and I'll come back to that one in

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,140
a second because I make a similar

00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,730
comment in the other two members are

00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,010
nominated by an elected by the

00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,900
membership and all member votes have

00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:06,240
equal weights and PMC members quitters

00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,860
are nominated by elected by projects and

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,600
no one PMC member has any more say than

00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,600
the other PMC member as a release is

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:16,919
made we do not have benevolent dictators

00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:18,930
at any level at the foundation it's not

00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:21,330
the case I wrote the code therefore I

00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,640
have more say it's not the case that

00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,410
I've been a member for 20 years and

00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,050
therefore my se is more valuable than

00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:30,630
somebody else's it's not the case that a

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,870
a single director can say you do this

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:35,580
and we'll do that it takes all nine

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,250
directors to come to consensus or at

00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,360
least a majority before any such changes

00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:44,740
have

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,930
this is important to how we work I want

00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,720
to give a very quick rush through of all

00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:51,100
our organization structure to show how

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,640
how much it takes to make this all

00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:56,770
happen in fundraising we've got a new

00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,540
employee a model of paid support to

00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:01,450
augment volunteers we were trying to

00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:04,420
with all volunteer effort for much of

00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:05,230
the life of the ASF and it's taken some

00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,570
time to the point where we actually

00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,100
found that when you actually need to pay

00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,470
some people to keep track of some

00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,600
mundane things and alike and for

00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,550
reaching out to sponsors no when

00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,760
necessary we've got a sponsor ambassador

00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:21,100
program each sponsor has an individual

00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,620
that's been assigned to them to keep

00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,720
track and keep them happy a formal

00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,790
targeted sponsorship program again you

00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,970
can click through the link I'm not gonna

00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:33,250
go into much detail but it talks about

00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,750
how we do targeted sponsorships where

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,390
you actually contribute money but it's

00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,650
for this one specific purpose and

00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:41,230
fundraising is very much involved with

00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:44,110
event support there are sponsors to

00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:46,200
Apache con which have been listed and

00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:48,340
I'll be listing them again

00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,860
infrastructure much of the focus has

00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,540
been on automation and commonly

00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,310
requested work items or just self-serve

00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,960
site where you could basically say I

00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,240
want a new get repository I want a new

00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,730
mailing list or I want to change my

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,160
password you just go there you make a

00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:06,190
few clicks and that happens without any

00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:10,120
additional infrastructure team member

00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:11,590
support necessary get box service to

00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,990
allow us to automate authenticate

00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:16,660
monitor and mirror nearly 1,800 github

00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:19,210
repositories we still have full control

00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:21,100
of all the source but you have all the

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:23,520
full access to all the the nice

00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:26,770
interface that github provides and

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:31,240
evaluating CDN offerings dough to

00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:35,680
improve worldwide access right now we

00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:37,930
have servers that are across the number

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,670
of places in the world a lot of our

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,720
accesses from China would like to

00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:43,690
actually be able to make certain that

00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,700
everybody accesses our web pages as if

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,860
it were local into a content delivery

00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,750
network

00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,589
help with that that's one of the types

00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,950
of things were looking at an

00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:54,720
infrastructure Community Development

00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:56,790
multiple roadshows I'll mention them in

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,079
the next slide participate in an

00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,060
external conferences we actually had a

00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:02,490
booth at OSCON

00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:05,070
in other places develop new contributor

00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,990
onboarding material how to become a new

00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:10,019
contributor is something that is a

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,459
consonant question and maybe development

00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:15,779
group has been working on trying to

00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:17,100
document that better begin to explore

00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,950
how to recognize non-technical

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,329
contributions not everybody as a coder

00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,529
plenty of people have other talents and

00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:25,260
other ways in which they can contribute

00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:27,660
and we haven't necessarily done as great

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,399
a jobs we would like in making certain

00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,880

was mentioned earlier who's been here

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,540
with Apache Software Foundation from the

00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,430
beginning she has got a role one of

00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,100
activities and she's queen of metrics

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,149
basically all of these things she can

00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,829
actually tell you how many Twitter

00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:55,920
followers we've got LinkedIn their

00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:58,260
impressions media queries etc I won't

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,190
even bother to read this the last thing

00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,980
is only to her and

00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,960
rapport that goes into more of it and in

00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,820
addition to all the metrics things there

foundation is YouTube video many of

00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:18,060
these things are blog entries find this

00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:20,340
presentation click on the links and find

00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:24,960
all the wonderful ways in which we have

00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:27,960
been marketing ourselves trademarks and

00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,310
branding processes request to use Apache

00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,440
much revenge merchandise and

00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:34,500
publications if somebody has a book on a

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,540
patchy spark or something we want to

00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,910
make certain that it actually uses our

00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,760
marks correctly and the like and so we

00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:43,950
get these requests and we and we process

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,450
them routinely legal support for

00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,590
registration we know assignment and

00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,690
infringement we've got a number of

00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:51,030
trademarks and there's processes deal

00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:52,050
with that are notable this year and

00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,580
actually was mentioned in the previous

00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,320
keynote we've got a number of

00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,570
organizations to create a new software

00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,220
license based on ours and we actually

00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,690
had to spend some time and effort to

00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,700
make to work with them to ensure their

00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:04,770
licenses were correctly named because

00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,290
many of them were patchy license with

00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:10,020
and then something that sounds nice well

00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:11,760
it actually is Apache license - and we

00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,290
didn't really find you want to create a

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:18,960
new license that your business just

00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:20,280
don't bring us into it legal affairs we

00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,660
had one of our sponsors put on the US

00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,060
restricted entities list we had to look

00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:26,340
through the details about export client

00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,410
compliance procedures you we anything

00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:31,800
we've got this crypto involved you can't

00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:33,630
go to certain nations incubator release

00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,360
policy we've got a release policy for

00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:37,860
how our projects work the incubators

00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,270
projects that are not quite projects

00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,340
just yet and we had to work through some

00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:43,200
of the details of what those things

00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:46,100
would be dams digital know it and

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,420
they'll copyright an act registration

00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:52,560
general license questions I mean can we

00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:55,380
do this with that other project we want

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,780
to have a dependency on formal line of

00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,920
communication with pro bono counsel

00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:01,680
interfacing with legal counterparts

00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,060
nerve foundations policies for modified

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,520
licenses that's what I mentioned the

00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:07,080
previous slide doing contracts again a

00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,880
lot of people doing a lot of busying

00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,380
things

00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:13,040
help make the people that just write

00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:14,630
code make their lives easier treasure

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,520
and finance I'll talk about them

00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,930
together and actually parts of this as

00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:22,250
president's role and part of this as

00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:23,990
boards roll five-year plan starts out

00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,970
started out with me collecting it and

00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:29,210
now has got a lot of extra contributions

00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:32,480
with the board deciding what the

00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:34,310
strategy is annual budget on responsible

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,730
for and together the budget and then

00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:40,970
we've got finance and treasurer who

00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:43,190
track it monthly review budget versus

00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,600
actual we're consistently under budget

00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,280
in terms of expenses and consists of

00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,900
exceeding budget in terms of donations

00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,600
so we're pretty proud of ourselves were

00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:53,180
pretty financially solvent last year we

00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,520
bought past our first ever audit and we

00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,810
passed it unqualified I don't know how

00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,700
many people who are accountants I'm

00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:02,150
certainly not but unqualified basically

00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:04,700
means absolutely no problems all our

00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:06,410
990s which are is records are published

00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,150
on lines and you can find them this is a

00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,550
link to all of them for all the previous

00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:12,800
year's board minutes and categorize

00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,420
these are links to all of our board

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,880
minutes are published one that one month

00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,460
later after the board meeting if we've

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,420
approved them but all of our stuff is

00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:26,200
online if we're ready for you to peruse

00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:28,580
diversity inclusion is our newest VP

00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,340
right now it's focusing on survey design

00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,570
contributor experience research and as

00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:36,980
was mentioned earlier iBM is

00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:42,050
contributing money towards outreach e2a

00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:45,920
have three entrance these are the

00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:48,610
initial focuses this effort while new

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,630
sort of dates back to Ross Carla

00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:53,900
presentation back in 2015

00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:55,970
talked about the need for diversity he's

00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:58,190
got a number of quotes up there when all

00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,160
think alike no one is thinking I mean

00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:02,240
I'm gonna go through the details of it

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,920
worth watching I would actually

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,140
recommend you watch his youtube video

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,060
here's a link to it it's not hard to

00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:10,980
find online and if you're interested in

00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:13,950
this topic risk waivers will have

00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:16,529
the state of diversity opens worse than

00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:19,769
the ESF tomorrow at one o'clock

00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:21,420
I recommend attending at her talk if you

00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:22,380
look around the room make the same

00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,029
comment that Ross made if you look

00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:27,510
around the room you will find that we do

00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:32,220
not seem to be as diverse as even the

00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:36,389
industry conference sponsors we have a

00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:41,670
lot of sponsors for the conference it's

00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:44,880
four for platinum sponsors a bunch of

00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:46,860
gold sponsors bronze sponsors and media

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,230
partners a large number of people helped

00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:52,380
make this successful similar thing for

00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:56,699
the foundation as a whole platinum

00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:58,260
sponsors gold sponsors I can't even

00:15:56,699 --> 00:16:01,110
spell all the time it takes to read just

00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,670
all the names we used to have just a

00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:05,310
handful of big sponsors and that was a

00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:07,529
concern now we've got a whole long list

00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:09,420
of sponsors and the targeted sponsors

00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:12,480
are ones that contribute services that

00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:16,949
we need versus dollars and those are

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,990
equally as valued more information
