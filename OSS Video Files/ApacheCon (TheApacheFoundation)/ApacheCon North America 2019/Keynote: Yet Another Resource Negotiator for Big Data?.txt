Publication date: 2019-09-12
Playlist: ApacheCon North America 2019
Description: 
	The core of Google Cloud's approach to data analytics is meeting customer needs, which means embracing the best of Apache technologies. In this session, we will give a brief overview of the work that the Google Cloud team is doing to make Apache big data software cloud native, yet portable, through Kubernetes enhancements.

Join this session to learn more about our Kubernetes approach to big data and our development of open source Kubernetes Operators that provide packaged control planes for running Apache applications inside of a Kubernetes cluster. These operators help abstract Google?s knowledge of running massive data analytics systems into open source software. This session will also include a short primer on using Kubernetes for data processing, a comparison of YARN vs Kubernetes, our current offerings, and our future plans
