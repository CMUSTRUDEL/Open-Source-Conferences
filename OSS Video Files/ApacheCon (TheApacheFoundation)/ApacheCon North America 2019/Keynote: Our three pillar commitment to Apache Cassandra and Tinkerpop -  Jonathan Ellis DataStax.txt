thank you it's great to be back at

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:08,880
Apogee con for the 20th anniversary no

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:11,759
less and just a slight correction my

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,360
time at working on Cassandra is

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,520
concurrent with my time at data stacks

00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:21,180
but I've actually been working on

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:25,550
Cassandra for over ten years which is

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:29,250
you know feels like a long time in the

00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:32,160
software industry and in fact that

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,390
predates Cassandra's contribution or

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,809
movement into the Apache foundation but

00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:41,969
20 years that's like way more than twice

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:44,579
as long as 10 that's that's that's

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:47,039
really something so you know sincere

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:50,100
congratulations to everyone who was you

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,570
know working on Apache in 1999 been a

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,090
part of that you know changing the

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,809
industry really changing the world

00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:59,579
that's really something to be proud of I

00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:00,989
actually had this this slide I didn't

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,120
know that Christopher was speaking

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:04,830
before me and gonna be spending 15

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,750
minutes talking about IBM and

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,110
open-source so I actually have this

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:13,340
article from IBM developer blog about

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,720
how your open source is eating the world

00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,060
and so that was a little bit redundant

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,240
now so I'll skip over that but I will

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,310
note that another good example is if you

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,590
were around an open source in the 90s

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,409
new Microsoft was kind of the big evil

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,060
empire Noah and you know some of us

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,890
would spell with Microsoft with a dollar

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,970
sign right and and that kind of stuff

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:38,159
today microsoft owns github by all

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:42,420
accounts they're a reasonably good

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:47,280
steward of of that you know open

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:49,200
community resource they you know they

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,670
created Windows subsystem for Linux

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,610
which I don't think anyone saw coming

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,860
they contribute to chromium so you know

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:59,159
you know congratulations

00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,469
open source one but you know I don't

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,210
think the next 20 years are going to be

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:05,369
you know a series of victory laps

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,520
I think there's new tensions and new

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:08,259
challenges

00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,200
we're going to be dealing with and one

00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:16,870
of those is is kind of telegraphed by

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:21,099
the articles on this slide there's we're

00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:24,340
entering an era of coopertition with the

00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:27,989
public cloud vendors as and the

00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:30,849
companies that fund and contribute to

00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:37,330
open source infrastructure software in

00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:40,170
particular so you see you know in the in

00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:43,000
the Apache foundation for instance

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:46,900
Amazon created managed streaming for

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,610
Kafka or MS msk and they don't

00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:52,110
to my knowledge contribute a great deal

00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:55,319
to the Apache Kafka project itself

00:02:52,110 --> 00:03:00,489
meanwhile msk directly competes with

00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:03,280
confluence Kafka service and confluent

00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:05,110
does contribute a great deal to Apache

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,470
Kafka so there's there's that tension

00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:10,959
there and different companies are

00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,930
dealing with this in different ways so

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:19,329
you have a confluent and you have Redis

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:23,290
and MongoDB and elastic have all reacted

00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:27,790
by changing the license on some of the

00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:29,769
the software that they distribute that

00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,079
nobody has nobody has an answer right

00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:34,389
there's no playbook here that says oh we

00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:37,150
just need to do what Red Hat did in the

00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:39,190
90s and and we'll you know create a

00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:42,430
successful outcome here so we're all

00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:45,519
trying to figure this out so I give this

00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,590
not to say that that you know I have all

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,169
the answers but that this is a

00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,299
background to understand you know this

00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:56,799
is the the world that we're moving into

00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:58,690
and this is is influencing all of all of

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,549
these strategies that that these

00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:04,840
open-source contributors are dealing

00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:07,810
with so today I'm going to talk about

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,840
the the what data stack sees as our

00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:13,349
three pillars of engagement with open

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,530
source and those are code

00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:19,940
content and community of course data

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:22,109
stacks primarily contributes to

00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:25,500
Cassandra and tinkerputt both of those

00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:28,169
are Apache projects that we also

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,940
contribute to your dozens of other

00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:37,650
open-source projects in a more minor way

00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:40,889
so first on the code side the the most

00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:45,060
visible of these is the Cassandra server

00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:51,030
itself data stacks continues to

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:53,880
contribute functionality and code to the

00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:57,139
Cassandra server and with the release of

00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,759
the four dot o alpha this past Sunday

00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:02,460
I'm pleased to announce that data stacks

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,280
is also running our internal test suite

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,680
against Ford ATO and we'll be releasing

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:13,400
the results of those and helping with

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:15,750
the stabilization and release of 4.0

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,270
some of you may also know that data

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,330
stacks maintains half a dozen or so of

00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:25,889
the most popular drivers for Apache

00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:28,259
Cassandra we've had a little bit of a

00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:30,389
split brain with the drivers though

00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:33,060
because what I'm trying to diagram on

00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:35,550
the left here is that you know we while

00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,979
we have the these open source Apache

00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:40,979
licensed drivers for Cassandra we've

00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:44,190
also had the commercial proprietary

00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:45,690
drivers labeled dsee that stands for

00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:49,320
data stacks Enterprise it's our

00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:51,900
commercial version of Cassandra and so

00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:55,680
we've retained some features and some

00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:58,440
functionality specific to the DRC

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,300
drivers so the second thing that I'm

00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:04,380
announcing today is that we are merging

00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:08,250
these we it makes more sense for us to

00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:12,240
be maximally open and maximally generous

00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:15,570
with the drivers and we'll be moving all

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,810
of the proprietary features into the

00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:21,469
open source drivers so some of those

00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:26,020
features include enhanced load balancing

00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:27,789
that's common to all of the drivers and

00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:32,410
rather than use something simple like

00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:35,560
round robin we actually look at the work

00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:38,860
queues on the servers and distribute the

00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:42,520
requests more intelligently for Python

00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:45,639
we have pre-built wheels for Java we

00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:48,039
have reactive stream support and we also

00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:50,949
have a spring boot support coming which

00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:52,360
makes it much easier to use the

00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:55,180
Cassandra driver from a spring

00:06:52,360 --> 00:07:00,430
application the time frame for this is

00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:04,060
late this fall so not not next week but

00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:06,430
this year and in fact if if the timing

00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:09,580
lines up we're hoping to be able to get

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:13,780
this out before the Cassandra fordo

00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:16,569
release so that's on the Cassandra side

00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,669
on the tinkerer pop side for those of

00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:23,979
you who aren't familiar with it tinker

00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:28,900
pop is a toolkit for graph databases it

00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:31,419
powers the most common graph databases

00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:34,539
in the industry not just data stacks

00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:38,229
graph but also Amazon Neptune Microsoft

00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:41,250
cosmos DB I believe there's something

00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:46,240
called Janus that our friends at IBM

00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:50,620
contribute to so that's what tinker pup

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,810
is and if you're wondering what a graph

00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,659
database is or why that would be useful

00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:57,789
I'll refer you to something we have

00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:59,529
called data stacks Academy I'll talk a

00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:02,469
little bit more about that later but

00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:05,009
this is where we have a ton of free

00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:09,940
training and information about both

00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:14,020
Cassandra and graph databases but data

00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:17,409
stacks is the the largest contributor to

00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:20,440
tinker pop and we'd be pleased to get

00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:27,219
your feedback on the upcoming tinker pop

00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:30,250
release as well finally data sex

00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:33,270
announced constellation which is our

00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:36,610
cloud platform a couple months ago

00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:37,930
constellation consists of three cloud

00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,760
services

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:43,120
and I'm gonna talk a little bit about

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:46,779
that second one here today which is data

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:50,130
stacks insights insights is a single

00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:53,580
pane of glass next generation

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:57,370
performance monitoring system for

00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,930
Cassandra based databases and by next

00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,110
generation I mean what we're trying to

00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:04,089
do here we're not trying to compete with

00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,830
Griffin and with paige of duty and let

00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:08,170
you know hey you know you lost a disk

00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:10,029
you should replace that or you know

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:13,120
you're having a network problem over in

00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:16,690
rack 43 what we're trying to do with

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,839
insights is give you proactive

00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:22,029
information about the trends in your

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,320
database and in your application

00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:28,450
behavior and let you get ahead of those

00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:32,080
so that you can avoid problems before

00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:35,020
they become acute so a good example for

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,630
the Cassandra people in the room is that

00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:40,330
insights can look at the tombstone build

00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:42,550
up across partitions and warn you know

00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:47,230
hey it looks like you're generating

00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:49,510
tombstones faster than they are evicted

00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:53,950
from the system and that's going to

00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:55,720
cause problems down the line so in May

00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:58,000
we announced that this is coming for

00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,740
data stacks Enterprise and the second

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,740
thing that I'm announcing today is that

00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:06,610
we're bringing this to all Cassandra

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:08,890
based servers so whether that status

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:12,490
taxes distribution or you're running

00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:14,680
vanilla Apache Cassandra we will make

00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:18,390
insights available not just available

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:22,930
but we will have a free tier of insights

00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:25,779
up to 50 nodes that we'll be happy to

00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:28,420
provide the QR code you're welcome to

00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:33,400
scan this that will take you to a sign

00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:35,290
up for early access for insights we're

00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:42,130
also happy to help you sign up at our

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:43,720
booth in the exhibit hall and just I'll

00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:46,779
note that the fine print here is that

00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:50,140
this is supporting Cassandra versions 3x

00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:53,200
so that means 3.0 which was released

00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:55,180
almost four years ago and more recent

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,700
versions than that so if you're still

00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:01,600
using an older release then consider

00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:03,310
this one more reason to upgrade I'm

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,190
really excited that that we're you know

00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:08,980
we've got this opportunity to shed some

00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:11,290
light on the dark art of Cassandra

00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,570
cluster operations and really say

00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:15,840
excited to bring that to the entire

00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,840
community

00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:26,190
I'm the content pillar I name-dropped

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:31,420
deadest X Academy just a minute ago we

00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:33,820
have had over 150,000 people sign up and

00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:37,060
start learning about Cassandra and about

00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:40,390
tinker pop and over 15,000 of those have

00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:42,970
completed full courses on either

00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:44,740
operations or development of Cassandra

00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:47,560
applications this is the most

00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:49,510
comprehensive resource for Cassandra

00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,300
anywhere and it's one of the most

00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:55,180
comprehensive resources for any project

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:57,220
of any kind we've spent millions of

00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:59,980
dollars developing this content and we

00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:03,310
make it available completely free for

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:06,340
everyone I think that Academy is one of

00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:09,000
the reasons that Cassandra has

00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:13,270
consistently ranked in the top 10

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,720
databases ranked by DB engines and if

00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:19,600
you see a company using Cassandra the

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,960
chances are good that someone or

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,950
multiple someone's there have used the

00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,950
Academy training

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:34,210
besides the the code and and the classes

00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:37,690
though if you take a step back the

00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:40,210
skills that were teaching people allow

00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,890
them to make their lives better and

00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:47,020
their families lives better in a very

00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:49,180
real way data stacks provides a

00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:52,750
certification program for Apache

00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:55,000
Cassandra and it's becoming an industry

00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:59,110
standard to the point where employers

00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,210
are asking for that as an indication

00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,310
that hey you know what you're doing with

00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,660
Cassandra so by making this

00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,910
training available by making this

00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:09,670
certification available

00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:15,100
you know we're helping people level up

00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:18,610
their job skills and you tackle more

00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:21,940
interesting challenges we're also happy

00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:26,440
not just to to host these public events

00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:29,650
that we host on a weekly basis but also

00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,480
to do private trainings so if your

00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:33,339
company is thinking about a project and

00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,810
you think hey this might be a good fit

00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:36,970
for Cassandra but I'm not really sure

00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:39,130
where to start we're happy to come in

00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:42,779
and you know our developer relations

00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:47,400
team can host a developer day to teach

00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:52,510
your team how to tackle these problems

00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:56,170
and then on on the community side the

00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:58,600
biggest and most flashy is hosting a

00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:05,050
yearly conference called data stacks

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:06,730
accelerate this is a place where we can

00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:10,540
bring together our enterprise customers

00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:13,900
and our open-source friends and people

00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:16,360
building cloud applications and get all

00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:20,050
of these groups together and you know

00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:24,360
share how we're solving some of the

00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:28,870
hardest problems in the industry this we

00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:30,630
extend our training into the accelerate

00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:34,589
conference we have a one-day boot camp

00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:37,960
that people have been very pleased with

00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:40,300
how fast that accelerates them into

00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:43,060
learning how to build Cassandra

00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:45,160
applications our first one was in

00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:48,160
Atlanta this year next years is going to

00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,690
be in San Diego registration isn't open

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,920
yet but you can sign up to be notified

00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:58,390
when it is the next level down in terms

00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:01,589
of size is the the meetups that we host

00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:04,180
and we've taken a deliberate strategy

00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:06,430
recently to kind of try to get out of

00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:08,860
the Cassandra echo chamber and move

00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:12,010
beyond hosting Cassandra specific

00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:16,330
meetups to also start to cross-pollinate

00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:16,990
with other kind of related fields so the

00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,779
pig

00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:24,040
in the upper right here this is from a

00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:26,620
data science meetup in Amsterdam which

00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:29,880
you wouldn't necessarily think is the

00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:33,820
you know the most fertile ground for

00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:37,270
Kassandra tutorials but we filled the

00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:39,690
room lots of interest there in you know

00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:47,700
how do how does Cassandra help me build

00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:50,290
real-time applications and then as

00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:53,170
another way we're trying to do some of

00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:55,600
this cross-pollination is with a youtube

00:15:53,170 --> 00:16:00,640
series called the distributed data show

00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:02,709
where we invite guests on to you talk

00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,520
about how they're solving problems

00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:09,160
whether that's in you know up the

00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:11,380
operations side of things in application

00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,180
development and these aren't just data

00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,550
stacks customers if you recognize some

00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,170
of the faces you can tell that you know

00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:20,500
we're really shooting for a

00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:22,839
cross-section of the industry and you

00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,130
know whoever can can tell us about an

00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:26,800
interesting project or an interesting

00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:29,560
approach or an interesting problem we'd

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:33,970
love to have them on and and you know

00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:37,959
give them a platform to share that so

00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:41,740
those are data sets of three pillars of

00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:44,410
code content and community again we'd

00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:46,990
love to see you at our booth and tell

00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:50,260
you a bit more about what data stacks is

00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:53,680
doing an open source and here's the QR

00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:56,110
code once more for the insights early

00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,559
access thank you very much

00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:00,559
