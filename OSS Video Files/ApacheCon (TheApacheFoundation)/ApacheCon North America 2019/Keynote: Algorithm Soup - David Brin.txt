Description: 
	Can we better understand the new era of floating software by looking back 3 billion years? As Moore’s Law fades, computational progress is driven less by hardware and more by rapidly advancing software entities that are fluid, dispersed, nothing like the smart machines envisioned in old sci fi. Some envision a molecular Internet of Services without clear boundaries. But a case can be made for replicating life. For developing “cell walls,” separate identities and AI entities that can be held accountable.
