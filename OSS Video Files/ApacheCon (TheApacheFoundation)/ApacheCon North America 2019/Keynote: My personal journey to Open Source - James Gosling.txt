Title: Keynote: My personal journey to Open Source - James Gosling
Publication date: 2019-09-12
Playlist: ApacheCon North America 2019
Description: 
	Abstract: Iâ€™ve been involved in what is now called Open Source since the 70s, long before the term was coined. My attitudes toward open source, and the Apache approach to it, have been formed by a series of experiences. This talk will be a combination of stories and philosophy.

thanks for inviting me here and I'm

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,910
going to sort of talk about you know

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:11,519
where my attitudes towards open source

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:16,230
came from because they they started

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:18,210
pretty early I'm not exactly sure how

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:23,160
old I am in that picture my mother

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:28,560
insists I'm 14 I think I might have been

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:31,260
a year or two older that is the one of

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,410
the ground station computer rooms of the

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,440
Isis two satellite and I got hired as a

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:40,379
hacker believe it or not mostly because

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,590
I had taught myself how to out of code

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:45,960
the problem with learning to code then

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,890
was that they're all there were were

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,649
like really basic books and finding

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:58,170
anybody who knew how to code was almost

00:00:52,649 --> 00:01:02,850
impossible and I just viewed it as the

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:06,180
world's craziest puzzle and you know

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:10,619
nonetheless I persevered but I had some

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:13,909
really interesting events along the way

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:21,030
so one of the first for me that was

00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:24,540
clearly open-source was this one the guy

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:28,650
over here this is a picture of Nicolas

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:31,259
worth in about 1970 roughly the time

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,570
that he created the Pascal programming

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:36,299
language and one of the things that he

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:39,090
did was he sent mag tapes to kind of

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,890
anybody who asked for and a place where

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,939
I was working the University of Calgary

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:46,439
got one of these tapes and the tape had

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,649
two things on it

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,060
one was a binary of the Pascal compiler

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:55,470
and the other was the source of the

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:57,570
Pascal compiler and of course the source

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:01,649
of the Pascal compiler was exactly one

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:03,240
file the the Pascal you know because

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:07,619
Pascal allows procedures within

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:13,650
procedures you know it was it was

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:15,659
literally one function but it was really

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,900
quite amazing to learn from I mean this

00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:22,280
was the first time I had ever seen a

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,689
full up large-scale piece of software

00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,110
written by somebody who actually knew

00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:29,340
what they were doing when I was working

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,829
in the physics department

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,920
it was mostly physicists and Latin

00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:38,129
electrical engineers and they're all

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:42,239
smart people but they're smart at

00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:47,700
whatever it is their specialty is you

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:50,280
know so-so learning programming from

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,769
somebody whose specialty is the particle

00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,019
physics of the upper atmosphere and the

00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:56,609
interactions of like alpha particles in

00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:00,359
the magnetic magnetosphere

00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:04,079
it's entertaining but you don't get the

00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:06,329
best skills right and and this piece of

00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:09,930
code from worth which you know if you

00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:13,250
look back on it it was a pretty

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:16,519
simplistic compiler but it was it was

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:21,900
that simplicity made it extremely

00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:24,989
comprehensive and and so it was this

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,879
thing that I could edit I had a couple

00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:30,299
of friends who were kind of partners in

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:34,590
crime and messing around with the Pascal

00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:39,690
compiler at one point I actually got got

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:45,030
hired to port it to multics I don't know

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:47,729
if anybody here remembers multics but

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:51,919
multics was a was a fabulous operating

00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:57,389
system destroyed by corporate stupidity

00:03:51,919 --> 00:04:00,900
if multics had been open source and not

00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:05,299
handled by clowns Linux wouldn't have

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:08,699
happened and UNIX wouldn't have happened

00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:11,540
because the people who started unix were

00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:15,109
had actually been on the multics

00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:18,750
project and unix in many ways was their

00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:19,150
reaction to multics having gotten kind

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,750
of other

00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:24,940
control but it was a really important

00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:28,780
formative experience for me to actually

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:33,880
be able to dig my my hands into this

00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:37,240
compiler the next next one along the

00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:44,169
road for me was Simula does anybody here

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:45,970
remember Simula no and so Simula was the

00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:49,000
world's first object-oriented

00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:55,030
programming language predated small talk

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:58,270
by 10 or 15 years and it came from the

00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:00,070
old John Dolan and Kristin Nygaard at

00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:06,130
the Norwegian Defense Research Institute

00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:09,039
a research establishment and you know

00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:11,919
the we got a copy of that but it was a

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,720
binary and the source but the source

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:17,680
wasn't on the tape the source was

00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:22,120
printed out on a stack of paper by date

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:27,010
inches thick and it was written in CVC

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:32,320
6000 assembler and for some sadistic

00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:34,479
reason I read it and this thing over on

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,840
on the right hand side this is an

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:42,159
example of what CDC 6000 assembly code

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:45,460
looks like and and it was you know a

00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:50,770
pretty horrific way to handle it and at

00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:52,750
one point I got a part-time job to to

00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,970
make it interact better with the i/o

00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:58,240
system on me rather grotesquely patched

00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:02,050
OS that we were running it on but since

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,620
I had the binary and the printout of the

00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:08,050
source all I could do is binary patching

00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:13,349
and you folks have probably never done

00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:13,349
binary patching of code but it sucks

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:23,080
that's a technical term but in ants are

00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:24,849
using using Simula I really fell in love

00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,710
with object-oriented programming and I

00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:29,300
really fell in love with

00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:32,650
and then on the other hand having the

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:36,170
source code with me I could actually

00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:38,570
learn how it all worked you know what

00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:41,870
what was magic underneath co-routines

00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:44,140
what was the you know what was the

00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,950
implementation trick that made

00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,900
object-oriented work who you know what

00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:50,120
was a virtual function table and how

00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:53,690
does it really work because people would

00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:58,460
never really document that kind of stuff

00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:59,960
even in the the first PhD thesis the

00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,620
first place that that there's like a

00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,310
piece of code that's that's clearly

00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:08,870
object-oriented it was a piece of

00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:14,300
assembler written in in in tx2 assembly

00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:17,450
language on at Lincoln labs by Ivan

00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:20,600
Sutherland and if you ever want to have

00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:26,570
your socks blown off just read Ivan

00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:30,200
Sutherlands thesis he he spends like a

00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:33,800
paragraph describing object-oriented

00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:37,370
programming and he spends like half of a

00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,960
chapter on doubly-linked lists because

00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:42,040
he thought doubly linked lists were way

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:47,690
cooler than object-oriented programming

00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:51,040
and and you know eventually when I got

00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:54,020
to doing my PhD my PhD thesis was

00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,720
essentially a macro expansion of one

00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:59,900
half of one paragraph of Ivan's thesis

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,240
and having had the privilege of having

00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:05,560
Ivan on my thesis committee it's just

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,750
like it's just amazing when you really

00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:13,630
read from someone who's worked at that

00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:19,000
kind of level then eventually I got to

00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:21,560
Carnegie Mellon and Carnegie Mellon was

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,670
and still it is a pretty amazing place

00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,860
and one of the things that was kind of

00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:32,330
in the air even though I got there kind

00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:34,430
of after the fact and I and since I

00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,279
wasn't actually there at the time I just

00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,079
sort of witnessed

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,919
after effects in the culture of the

00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:45,779
place not entirely sure that I got all

00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:47,910
the details right but so I don't know if

00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:53,809
any of you have ever listened to the

00:08:47,910 --> 00:09:00,059
rock opera Godspell that was actually

00:08:53,809 --> 00:09:03,350
the a project that one of the students

00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:05,490
did while he was a student at Carnegie

00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:08,220
Carnegie Mellon has really two

00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:15,629
world-class departments computer science

00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:18,749
and Performing Arts and so so so this

00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:22,519
person writes Godspell he graduates

00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:26,279
Godspell becomes a big deal on Broadway

00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:32,189
makes gobs of money the guy becomes

00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:34,559
famous CMU had interesting intellectual

00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:38,610
property laws with respect to students

00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:41,639
mainly that whatever students did

00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:43,920
students owned a lot of other

00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:45,600
universities and I suspect most other

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,410
universities have these rules that

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:52,829
essentially say that the student gets

00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:56,269
like it's some split like 50/50 that the

00:09:52,829 --> 00:10:00,209
school gets it and the student gets and

00:09:56,269 --> 00:10:08,160
so what CMU tried to do was retro

00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:12,870
actively change their IP rules and that

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:16,529
did not go over well and and it and

00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:18,540
exactly what happened what court cases

00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:19,889
happened would every all of that what

00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:24,629
exactly happened

00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:27,660
I don't know but I do know that that

00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:30,959
that people were like hypersensitive to

00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:33,839
all kinds of IP things because they were

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:38,910
kind of worried about the the university

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:41,850
administration and the the rules did not

00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,569
get changed after having tried to pull

00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,069
this stunt

00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:47,089
there was like no way that they could

00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:50,239
change it so in the

00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:55,059
computer science department there were a

00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:55,059
couple of things that that came out that

00:10:55,539 --> 00:11:03,049
the people got kind of hyper about one

00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:09,499
was thing called scribed which I dearly

00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:12,049
love scribe was kind of like well it

00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:15,619
predated tech but it was kind of like

00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:18,169
tacking that in that it was a notation

00:11:15,619 --> 00:11:21,499
for writing printed documents that would

00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:23,179
come out beautiful and it was really

00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:26,239
really nicely done

00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:32,179
it was the PhD thesis of a guy named

00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:35,329
Brian Reed and then there was there was

00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:40,129
the thing that I did namely Emacs when I

00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:43,549
did the port of the ETH Pascal of

00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:45,319
multics I got to learn Emacs on multics

00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:48,289
because that was that had become kind of

00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:51,229
the most common editor on multics was

00:11:48,289 --> 00:11:56,179
Emacs of course this is not the same as

00:11:51,229 --> 00:12:00,319
the as the pdp-10 Emacs the folks at MIT

00:11:56,179 --> 00:12:04,669
did but then I got get in get get get to

00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:07,809
grad school and I'm like damn you know

00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:07,809
VI socks

00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:21,240
well it's true right and you know at the

00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:26,200
time I was I was using

00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:31,320
UNIX all the time and and at about that

00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:37,600
time it was mostly v7 unix from from

00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:40,210
Bell Labs and but over time we sort of

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,830
migrated to using BSD as the B as the

00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:47,710
Berkeley folks started to get stuff that

00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:53,220
was actually running and and so Emacs

00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:55,660
got pretty popular I started it I

00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,210
started attending mag capes all over the

00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:02,890
place cuz you know the this was the

00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:05,200
early days of the ARPANET and the the

00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:08,560
high-speed dedicated point-to-point

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:11,470
links that went across the country were

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,010
all 50 kilobits per second they were the

00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:17,290
most expensive highest speed links ever

00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:19,950
and and if you've got like a big piece

00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:25,390
of source code or a binary or something

00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:29,800
a mag tape and US Mail will beat the

00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:34,270
network every time it's not that way

00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:37,420
anymore thank God but but but because of

00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:40,270
the whole Godspell thing you know I had

00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:43,420
all these you know I was like really you

00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:46,680
know I was really open to sharing this

00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:51,670
stuff I just didn't want to be abused

00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:54,490
and it got that sort of got heightened

00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:58,060
for me when I when I got contacted by

00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:59,800
some folks who were founding a new

00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,080
company that did mini computers and they

00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,270
wanted to put Emacs on it and they

00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:07,720
wanted to make like Emacs be like the

00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:12,190
command front-end for it which was a

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:14,470
little bizarre but you know their letter

00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:18,459
was was was basically was almost

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:19,510
literally you'll get famous and will get

00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:23,889
rich

00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:25,810
and you know I was I was sort of like if

00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:31,209
you guys are planning to get rich off of

00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:33,639
this thing at least give me a cut you

00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:38,709
know cuz you know I was a grad student

00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:40,899
right anyway I was like really careful

00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:42,850
about it and at and at one point it

00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:45,970
became clear that I actually that I

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,110
either had to find somebody else to

00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:50,940
maintain Emacs

00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:54,940
or I could graduate I couldn't do both

00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:58,959
so I ran around went around the internet

00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:01,750
trying to find somebody who would take

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,370
over the maintenance of Emacs so that

00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:06,370
I'd have enough time to get to graduate

00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:09,459
and I couldn't find anybody right

00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:13,329
everybody all all all that they always

00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:16,110
had a day job and and I found you know

00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:21,220
what were literally two guys in the dog

00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:22,750
in a garage in New Jersey who are

00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,600
willing to take it over but they had to

00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:27,310
pay the rent so I said you know you

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,250
could chart okay here take it you can

00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:31,510
charge commercial customers but

00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:34,120
universities have to get it for free and

00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:38,740
they were happy with that and then

00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:42,569
certain people like exploded and mostly

00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:45,970
it was strangely enough IBM and Dec

00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:47,589
they started behaving strangely the two

00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,740
guys in the garage actually hired some

00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:52,180
lawyers it turned into a big court case

00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:55,360
the two guys in the garage actually won

00:15:52,180 --> 00:16:00,399
but it was kind of a Pyrrhic victory and

00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:03,399
it was just freaking messy and even

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,230
though I was trying to run it kind of

00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:11,399
like open source I mean the vid concept

00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:11,399
wasn't there trying to stop people from

00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:18,550
really abusing the kindness like that

00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:21,579
though you know that one letter or the

00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:26,459
the the stunts that Dec and IBM were

00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:30,760
pulling they really really ticked me off

00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:32,340
and you know that's that that sort of

00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,840
has played out

00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:38,430
but sometimes you know when you do

00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:42,360
things like like like one of the pieces

00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:44,520
of work that I did as I was doing sort

00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,610
of experiments to lead up to my PhD

00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:51,839
thesis was I built a spreadsheet

00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:55,430
calculator and if you do a google search

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:59,310
and you type in man SC you'll get the

00:16:55,430 --> 00:17:01,950
the man page for for SC or you can get

00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:06,990
to or you can look it up on Wikipedia

00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:09,140
this is its Wikipedia page and it was

00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:14,819
you know just an experiment that I did

00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:18,600
to try to understand why the evaluation

00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:20,069
rules in VisiCalc were so stupid and

00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,510
they didn't need to be that see but it

00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:23,970
was because they were just like top to

00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:25,380
bottom left to right and they didn't

00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,089
need to be they could be dependency

00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,680
directed now I I did these like

00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:33,420
dependency directed algorithms and it's

00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:36,500
likely this was nard and and it was a

00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:42,929
spreadsheet calculator that worked on

00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:45,690
text terminals and it's still there the

00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:49,670
you can still you can still get it I'm

00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:53,460
listed as the original author and I

00:17:49,670 --> 00:18:02,160
built it in about 1980 the latest

00:17:53,460 --> 00:18:04,530
releases in 2018 version 7.16 and you

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,600
know it's it's like 40 years later this

00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,980
thing is still kicking and it was

00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,390
something that I spent a week on and

00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,310
threw through over the wall and said if

00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,630
you want to have fun go ahead but and

00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:16,700
that's one of the things that I find

00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:19,740
really lovely about open source is that

00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:21,690
you know often when people just throw

00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,340
things over the wall they get abandoned

00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:28,860
and they just like a sink away and

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:31,020
sometimes they acquire a life and you

00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:34,620
know just depends on who finds them to

00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:38,280
be valuable and then then I eventually

00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:40,620
ended up working at Sun and in many ways

00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,320
Sun was was built on an open source

00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:45,110
although getting the corporate lawyers

00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:51,770
happy with the whole content

00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:57,320
was was difficult the the the the Sun OS

00:18:51,770 --> 00:19:01,370
and Solaris were all based on BSD the

00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:06,190
the original engineering staff at Sun

00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:10,040
was all basically hippie weirdo freaks

00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:15,560
and and there was like like way too much

00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:19,670
Qaeda in the halls and and and so we use

00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:22,340
BSD but we use BSD kind of inbound you

00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:25,340
know getting the lawyers happy with

00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,210
releasing stuff under similar terms was

00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,720
really hard

00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:34,610
there was a utility called indent that I

00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:37,310
believe was Sons was the first piece of

00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:43,160
software that that son contributed to

00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:45,860
that it was possible to get the the the

00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,630
lawyers happy with redistributing it and

00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:50,990
this was something that had originally

00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:54,710
come from a university whose name I

00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:56,900
forget but now you know if you go if you

00:19:54,710 --> 00:20:04,730
type you know man indent you'll still

00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:07,340
find it including evidence of a kissing

00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:10,490
fight that I had with a guy named Bill

00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:12,440
Shannon it's still in there right it

00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:15,230
says you know Bill Shannon it's it's

00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:19,430
this particular way that he wanted to

00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:21,530
put blanks always after size of so even

00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:24,140
if you parenthesized the parameter after

00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:26,000
size of he still wanted there to be a

00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:29,600
blank between size of and the

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,210
parentheses and not but not do functions

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,700
that way you know so that sort of a few

00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:36,980
typed size of in a syntax that was

00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:40,370
reminiscent of a function he didn't want

00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:46,760
it formatted like a function so he

00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:49,310
wanted a blank before sizeof and and so

00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:52,350
I called it the Bill Shannon option or

00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:55,320
the BS option

00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:57,780
and no disrespect to bill he is one of

00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:01,890
my favorite people in the world but he

00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:05,340
has and and even though it's been like

00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:07,020
half a forever since then I I was kind

00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:14,430
of amazed to find that that little

00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:18,600
foodfight lives on so Java that was a

00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:22,470
pretty rocky road and it was a pretty

00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:25,460
difficult road from the point of view of

00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:28,800
the the sort of open source aspects

00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:31,470
because we you know the very first day

00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:35,790
we released Java we released it with all

00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:43,410
the sources but the license was kind of

00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:45,570
complex and messy and and it was it was

00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:49,650
sort of and I wasn't involved in that

00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:52,260
that personal license at all it was sort

00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:54,870
of an attempt to get some kind of

00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:58,410
fairness because things were getting

00:21:54,870 --> 00:22:02,910
kind of out of hand actually a lot out

00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:05,130
of hand and and and one of the things

00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:08,670
that we kept running into was this

00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:13,530
notion of you know that you know freedom

00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:17,010
is a balance you know freedoms often

00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:19,470
collide you know and you find instances

00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:22,100
of this all over the place right one of

00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:25,050
the the simplest is the agreement that

00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:28,290
will all limit you know our freedom of

00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:30,480
what side to the road to drive on in

00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:33,840
order to gain some freedom to live

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,970
without fear right I mean I mean what

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,480
would the world be like if there wasn't

00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:41,400
a rule that says thou must drive on the

00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,930
left side of the road the right side of

00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:49,320
the road depending on where you are and

00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:54,000
and so yes you end up with restrictions

00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:56,580
on your freedom but everybody lives and

00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,800
and and and one of the the things we

00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:00,800
were particularly worried about was that

00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:07,740
all that there were kind of two camps of

00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:10,110
people there were developers and there

00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,900
were let's call them platform providers

00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:17,490
they were the people like Microsoft and

00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:22,050
and IBM and HP and Apollo and Dec and

00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:25,410
Apple and all of these folks and they

00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:27,180
wanted the ability to differentiate but

00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:29,670
they would say differentiate in a way

00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:31,320
that made it sound like a good thing but

00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:33,630
in actual fact what worked what people

00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,090
really wanted was ways to make things

00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:39,300
sticky they wanted to be able to treat

00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:42,090
Java the way they treated SQL alright so

00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:45,140
if any of you have used SQL extensively

00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:49,380
on commercial databases they always have

00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:51,180
extensions and weirdness and the chant

00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:54,720
you know so so if you've got some app

00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:58,020
that's been written to use the the

00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,720
sequel on an Oracle database the chance

00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:03,810
is that you can lift that up and drop it

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,050
down on top of my sequel or postgrads or

00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:10,320
something like that it's pretty limited

00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:13,830
and you know from a developer's point of

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:18,810
view that sucks from platform providers

00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:20,760
point of view that's exactly perfect you

00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:22,560
know so we were trying to balance you

00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,960
know platform providers ability to

00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:28,440
differentiate with developers right to

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:31,260
expect their code to run and there was a

00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,560
there was a big marketing campaign that

00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:36,450
I don't think Microsoft literally called

00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,510
it this but you know they're they're

00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:42,710
they're their mantra was a embrace and

00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:45,330
extend which of various people

00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:50,010
translated to things like deface and

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:51,240
distend because they yeah they got a

00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:56,420
little weird

00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,420
got sued and lost some court cases and

00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:04,460
yadda yadda and and so you know one of

00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,860
the things that was was hard at the time

00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:10,940
was you know how do you come up with

00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:13,940
rules that control bullies that don't

00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:16,100
annoy everybody else and you and it's

00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,960
really really hard

00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:22,600
the java community process was an

00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:27,800
attempt to do that I think it was

00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:33,110
middling successful it was hard to get

00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:34,670
as much community involvement as we

00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:38,510
would have liked just because the

00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:40,340
commercial involvement was so heavy and

00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:43,250
coming up with these rules was just

00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:47,750
crazy like in the very first iteration

00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:52,940
of the of the JCP one of the rules was

00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:55,610
that all decisions had to have a a paper

00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:58,430
trail or an email trail that could be

00:25:55,610 --> 00:26:02,780
audited so that you could discover why a

00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:06,320
decision went one way or the other and a

00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:07,940
bunch of the the big players wanted that

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,310
to be in there so that they could know

00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,620
that they weren't being bullied me is

00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:15,320
sort of weird to think of you know

00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:21,260
companies like IBM worried about being

00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:26,390
bullied but you know within like a year

00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:31,310
that rule got cut because they all love

00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:33,290
backroom deals and and and it was just

00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:36,280
really really hard to figure out you

00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:40,660
know how to do that but eventually

00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:46,220
eventually we got to GPL and this was

00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:50,120
partly a you know you know it was partly

00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:52,850
a major leap of faith faith from lots of

00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:55,100
people at Sun and one of the things that

00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:59,690
was kind of surprising to folks was it

00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:02,060
wasn't a financial disaster disaster the

00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:05,900
the whole you know revenue from service

00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:08,360
and support works but it particularly

00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:10,940
works if you're a large trusted

00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,049
organization and a lot of companies in

00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:15,480
the open source world try to intern

00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:17,249
revenue out from service and support and

00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,499
and and often one of the biggest

00:27:17,249 --> 00:27:20,940
problems is you know they'll have these

00:27:19,499 --> 00:27:22,889
big enterprise customers and the

00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:27,269
customers will say well how can I trust

00:27:22,889 --> 00:27:28,950
you will you be around in five years to

00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:32,190
support this thing that we're depending

00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:35,519
on and one of the things that we found

00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:38,039
out as kind of a piece of the math of

00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:40,139
the system is that the the marketing

00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:45,299
leverage that we got by having such

00:27:40,139 --> 00:27:49,129
broad access was was greater than any

00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:53,820
license revenue we could ever have made

00:27:49,129 --> 00:27:57,570
yeah and and and and and and the other

00:27:53,820 --> 00:28:03,179
the other big thing that happened was

00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:07,080
that the sort of forking and distending

00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:09,840
Java became because it becomes such a

00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:12,989
big thing it was being really controlled

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,330
by the community you know when when

00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:18,440
people start to get out of line the

00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:22,499
community would would in mouth and

00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:25,619
we were far less effective at

00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:30,179
controlling various folks then then the

00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:32,909
community was and just kind of letting

00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:38,309
the community have their influence was

00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:40,830
almost always the right answer and and

00:28:38,309 --> 00:28:43,379
and and one of the nice things about the

00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:46,470
the the open sourcing of Java was that

00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:51,119
it led to the open sourcing of

00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:54,059
essentially everything else son did son

00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:57,419
G failed almost everything with one

00:28:54,059 --> 00:29:01,799
really noticeable exception and that was

00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:04,590
Solaris they kind of open source with a

00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:08,999
kind of open source license that it had

00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:11,159
a variety of problems and and and it

00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:15,299
really it was it was mostly a people

00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:17,549
problem inside the teams they did get

00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:21,230
close and they were making progress if

00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:21,230
they had had like another year or so

00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:27,100
you know that the solarz was was being

00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:30,070
was experiencing continued adoption and

00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:32,190
growing adoption definitely making

00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:34,749
progress and the teams are making

00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:38,379
progress emotionally getting with the

00:29:34,749 --> 00:29:43,570
whole thing but then there was a change

00:29:38,379 --> 00:29:47,860
in ownership its Oracle yeah you did I

00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:51,090
say more and then but the the Java

00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:56,070
community empowered by the license

00:29:51,090 --> 00:30:00,610
powered by the open JDK empowered by

00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:03,789
kind of Oracle's really fear of the

00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:07,990
community kept the beast at bay and Java

00:30:03,789 --> 00:30:13,899
survived nicely it's doing well I'm

00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:19,960
astonished but Solaris tragically and I

00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:24,009
deeply loved Solaris Oracle was able to

00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:28,480
kind of claw back the the the license

00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:30,639
and they and they made it be a a you

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:36,909
know something that was a direct revenue

00:30:30,639 --> 00:30:42,399
generator with with prices that were

00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:44,710
just freakin absurd and you know so I

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:48,940
eventually had to turn off my last

00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:51,190
Solaris machine at home everybody that I

00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:53,980
know had who had Solaris machines of

00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:59,139
Commons Solaris made a really really

00:30:53,980 --> 00:31:03,220
wonderful raid array manager you know

00:30:59,139 --> 00:31:07,779
ZFS is phenomenal but it was a total

00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:10,899
crash and burn so what do I love about

00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:14,049
Apache why why did I come here

00:31:10,899 --> 00:31:18,730
I guess my my number one thing is the

00:31:14,049 --> 00:31:24,460
Apache License it's it's it's it's it's

00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:27,059
like the lowest religion license that's

00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:31,419
it's really really clean it's got a

00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:33,149
phenomenally strong community and the

00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:35,190
community isn't just the

00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:38,580
committers the the people who were parts

00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:41,849
of the Apache foundation but all of the

00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:44,279
people who use it and and one of the

00:31:41,849 --> 00:31:47,700
really important distinguishing things

00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:51,899
about Apache for me is that they have a

00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:53,999
real code of conduct you know every now

00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:57,599
and then people kind of turn into

00:31:53,999 --> 00:32:00,200
bullies and they get swatted you know

00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:02,549
and then some of the other communities

00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:07,049
people get kind of out of hand and

00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:09,719
there's there isn't that there often

00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:12,239
aren't the same kind of rules that

00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:14,159
Apache has and Apaches rules you know if

00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:17,219
you you know if you look through like

00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:20,429
all the rules of you know what you have

00:32:17,219 --> 00:32:23,539
to go through to become a CAMAC emitter

00:32:20,429 --> 00:32:27,330
the kind of agreements you have to sign

00:32:23,539 --> 00:32:30,570
they're pretty strict but really there

00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:34,409
they're there to stop people from all

00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:36,109
kinds of abusive games and then of

00:32:34,409 --> 00:32:38,700
course they let me be a committer I

00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:44,249
haven't committed very much actually

00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:46,799
very close to zero but I do an awful lot

00:32:44,249 --> 00:32:50,609
of testing and random other things for

00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:54,690
for the NetBeans project I'm a big

00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:56,909
supporter of Apache NetBeans and you

00:32:54,690 --> 00:33:01,289
know having watched the whole progress

00:32:56,909 --> 00:33:04,710
through the the you know joining Apache

00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:06,210
going through the incubation process and

00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:11,969
then graduating to be a top-level

00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:14,009
project that I thought was fabulous you

00:33:11,969 --> 00:33:16,679
know the the Apache team has done such a

00:33:14,009 --> 00:33:19,109
wonderful job and thanks to everybody

00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:21,570
who was involved in that not only in

00:33:19,109 --> 00:33:24,379
that one particularly but in in coming

00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:28,759
up with the code of conduct around that

00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:33,690
so thanks these days I work at Amazon

00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:41,239
Apache is our default license for all of

00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:41,239
our open-source projects and thank you

00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,390
