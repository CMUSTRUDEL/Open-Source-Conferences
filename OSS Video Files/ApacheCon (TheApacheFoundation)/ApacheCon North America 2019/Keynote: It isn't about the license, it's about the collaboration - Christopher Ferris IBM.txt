Publication date: 2019-09-11
Playlist: ApacheCon North America 2019
Description: 
	There's been a disturbance in the force lately with a number of projects abandoning open source licenses for licenses that carry commercial covenants or constraints, or worse, abandoning open source licensing altogether in favor of source available licensing. This will not end well if the industry doesn't recognize that open source isn't about the license. The value isn't in the source code. It's about fostering a diverse collaborative community of sustainable support and continuous improvement and innovation. In his talk, Christopher, an IBM Fellow and IBM's CTO of Open Technology, will share his perspectives on the value of open governance for open source projects.
