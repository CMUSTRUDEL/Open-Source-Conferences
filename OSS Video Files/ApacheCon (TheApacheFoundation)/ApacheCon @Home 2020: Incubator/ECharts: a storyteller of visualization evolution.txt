With the increasing demand for data visualization and a deeper understanding of theories, the role of data visualization tools has changed dramatically over the years. Previously, the main expectation was to help users understand abstract data through a static chart. Later, interactive tools were introduced to help users better understand the relationships between data. Today, another important aspect of our expectations is the ability to tell the stories. We expect visualization tools to help users explore and think about the story behind the data and get inspired or motivated to take further steps after reading the charts. In this sharing, we will introduce why and how Apache ECharts (incubating) has evolved to adapt to the changing needs and formed a modern visualization tool as you see today.

Wenli is a data visualization developer and PPMC of Apache ECharts (incubating). She has open-sourced many data visualization projects on GitHub (ID: Ovilia) and is enthusiastic about open-source community.
