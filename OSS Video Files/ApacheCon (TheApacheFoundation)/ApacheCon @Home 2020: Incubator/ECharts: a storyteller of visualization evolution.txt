	ECharts: a storyteller of visualization evolution

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

With the increasing demand for data visualization and a deeper understanding of theories, the role of data visualization tools has changed dramatically over the years. Previously, the main expectation was to help users understand abstract data through a static chart. Later, interactive tools were introduced to help users better understand the relationships between data. Today, another important aspect of our expectations is the ability to tell the stories. We expect visualization tools to help users explore and think about the story behind the data and get inspired or motivated to take further steps after reading the charts. In this sharing, we will introduce why and how Apache ECharts (incubating) has evolved to adapt to the changing needs and formed a modern visualization tool as you see today.

Wenli is a data visualization developer and PPMC of Apache ECharts (incubating). She has open-sourced many data visualization projects on GitHub (ID: Ovilia) and is enthusiastic about open-source community.

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,840
cool

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,840
so let's get started

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,280
hello everyone thanks for joining me

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,640
today with this topic

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,039
first a little explanation on the title

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,039
data visualization tools have been

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,680
evolving over the years

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,000
and today i'm going to introduce the

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,879
evolving history with the features

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,120
apache each has gradually adds and

00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,760
hopefully through this very specific

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,039
tool

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,240
i wish to give you some insights on why

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,920
and how these changes happen for general

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,240
database products

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,600
and how it has shaped the modern

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,560
visualization tools we see today

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,240
on the other hand recently we have added

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,040
a few new features

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,600
to apache e-charts so that it is better

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,479
at

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,479
start telling stories behind the data

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,360
and making it a great tool for

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,360
storytelling

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,880
so i'm welly john and you may also call

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,119
me ovilia

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,240
i've joined the project for about five

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,200
years ago

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,079
and i'm working full-time honest now i'm

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,600
a member of

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,320
apache e-charts incubating pvmc and also

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,320
a committer

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,399
e-trans was originally a project inside

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,119
our

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,719
company baidu eight years ago an

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,520
engineer created a

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,119
chat tool to solve the problems relating

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,680
to his job

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,880
and after half years improvement he made

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,720
this open source

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,760
on github under an of baidu

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,720
in 2018 the project was donated to the

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,360
asf

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,640
and it has been under incubation since

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,879
then

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,879
now we are working on our next big

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,520
release each husband 5

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,160
and discussing about graduation in our

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,160
mailing list

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,360
first let's ask why do we need a chart

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,840
in the first place

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,360
why it is not enough to show the data

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,319
itself

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,840
well let's take this case for example

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,319
this is a survey

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,160
about one's attitudes on violence

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,800
against women

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,560
to be more specific it asks whether you

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,800
think it is justified

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,319
beating wife when she does certain

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,720
things

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,680
when you look at this table you may find

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,159
it hard to

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,440
get the point of these figures at first

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,280
sight

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,800
well unless you are mass genius

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,400
apparently

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,519
but if we take a little visual hint

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,239
like using bars for data values

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,360
we can get the idea of this table much

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,400
faster

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,959
the people with higher education tends

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,640
to have

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,519
less violent attitudes against women

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,840
we call these bar charts but they are

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,519
just

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,920
a simple rectangles in essence right

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,720
we all know that a picture is more than

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,319
a thousand

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,879
words but how does this happen

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:42,879
why do we understand pictures much

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,879
better than words or numbers

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,120
our ancestors spent millions of years

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,560
surviving and involving where visual

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,000
signals played as

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,640
crucial rule according to

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,560
revolutionary laws those who don't

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,439
understand pictures well

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,439
were more likely to get killed or failed

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,760
to find enough food

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,439
so it is harder for their dna to pass

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,640
along

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:15,120
on the other hand side words and numbers

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,639
were invented only a few thousand years

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,359
ago

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,919
so our ability to understand words and

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,440
numbers

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,520
is much less developed than pictures

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,360
which gives you a good reason to use

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,199
charts instead of raw data

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,199
to convey messages to others

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,960
charts at the early stage only had

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,240
simple functions

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,440
and would and were most likely to be

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,120
static

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:48,639
without animation or interaction

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,080
naive as it might be it did complete the

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,240
job to help people

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,240
better understand obscure data

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,479
and next i'm going to tell the story of

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,000
how

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:04,320
step by step this naive charts evolved

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,120
into modern chart visualization

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,520
tools we have much more complex

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:14,400
functions today

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,360
we see in previous examples that charts

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,560
at this stage

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,320
were quite simple and have only limited

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,960
functions

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,080
chart types were limited to most

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,360
frequently used

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,560
ones like bar charts line charts

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,199
scatter charts and pie charts

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,919
it had little interactions and it served

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,560
almost

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:40,240
us as image and it was hard to use chart

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,840
tools at this stage

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,560
to do things complex also

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,520
there were limited animations and not

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,520
very good looking

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,840
so people at this stage realizes that

00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,319
it is useful to involve more animations

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,960
and more chart types to make charts

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,960
fancier

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,880
the ability to make complex animation

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,240
is required in some cases to make charts

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,120
to be more pleasing

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,960
and interesting each us provides

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,560
animation duration

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,800
and delay for each data item so it is

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:27,120
flexible enough to create different

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,919
animation effects for various situations

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,960
and all our attempts to make charts more

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,199
pleasing

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,360
are not just for aesthetical

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,000
considerations

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,720
more importantly a nicer looking chart

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,280
may also provide a higher probability

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,319
that users love your product and tend to

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,319
use it more often

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,199
more charge types were supported at this

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,840
stage

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,319
take apart each other for example we

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,240
have

00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:02,639
radar charts heat map charts

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:05,199
parallel charts sandy charts and so on

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,759
in fact apache e-chart provides more

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,479
than 20 built-in charge types

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,199
and there are community-made extensions

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,880
to further

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,800
increase this number by providing a

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,440
large number of chart types

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,280
it is more flexible for developers to

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,720
make different charts for different

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,720
data in scenarios

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,680
besides if you have very specific charts

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,720
to make

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,520
each has also provide very flexible apis

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,759
for you

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,120
to make charts like these another of our

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,759
ppmc member

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,880
from shared a speech yesterday at the

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,840
apache calm

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,039
sharing about how apache echas designed

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,800
this flexible

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:53,919
yet easy to use api for users to create

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,800
customized charts you can check out his

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:59,840
slides for

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,840
more information if you are interested

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,120
furthermore apache etc has an extension

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,319
based on webgl

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:11,319
to make 3d charts like 3d globes

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,479
parametric curves in the surfaces city

00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:15,199
visualization

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,199
and so on

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,039
so at stage two we did have more

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
decorations

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,560
like animations and more chapter types

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,479
to make

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,520
charts look prettier the reason why i

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,599
am using the word decorations here

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,640
is that sometimes these kind of

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,839
improvements

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,240
do not necessarily provide any extra

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,200
information

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,399
for example the left chart is a stacked

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,040
bar series

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,920
in a polar system while the one on the

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,120
right side

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:54,959
is a more traditional bar series in the

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:58,000
cartesian system by making the

00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:01,680
bar charts be in a polar system

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,920
does not provide any extra information

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,839
so we say that they are visually

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,399
equivalent

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,800
but in some cases it just provides

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,880
special flavors to the charts

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,880
and thus makes it more engaging

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,279
since the animations and interactions

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,800
were most for

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,160
decoration the ability to let users

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,360
explode the data

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:33,760
are still limited in stage two

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,800
and that is why we introduced more

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,920
interactions

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,399
at stage 3 to help users explore the

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,680
data

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,680
and better understand it

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,279
when jeremy franklin had this famous

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,760
saying that

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,560
tell me and i forget teach me and i

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,160
remember

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,720
involved me and i learn by including

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,600
interactive components in a chart

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,640
provides a chance for the users to

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,160
involve

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,279
so that they can get a better

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:09,279
understanding of your data

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:12,320
let's take legend for example stage 2

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,480
legends were usually static and just for

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,920
indicating which color is for which

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,680
series

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:22,959
but at stage 3 it became interactive

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,920
a user may hover on a legend to switch

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:32,560
on or off a series and see the

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:36,240
comparation with other series

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,959
in hrsv5 we also provide a way to

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,760
highlight

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:42,560
a certain series when hovering on one

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,920
piece of the series data

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,560
that is more by downplaying other series

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:53,040
we make the one series stand out

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,040
and see the data without distraction

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,240
data zooming is also a great tool to

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,680
explore the details of

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,200
data in this case we have a million

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,240
scatter points

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,560
we can first have an overall impression

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,680
of

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:15,120
the whole data shape and then zoom in to

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,360
see the details of a certain part

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,839
another thing was mentioning is that

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,720
apache he charged providing progressive

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,279
rendering

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,839
so that it is able to render a million

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,399
scatter points like this

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,040
if you are interested in this topic you

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,680
may find

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,079
more information on my youtube channel

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,200
where

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:37,760
i introduced how each has rendered tens

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,240
of millions of data in real time

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:44,000
the link is included in the slides which

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,000
you may download after this talk

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,800
another interesting interactive

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:54,240
component e-chass provides

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,120
is data brushing in this example

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,680
you may brush select part of the data on

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,200
the left

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,760
side and the bar series will be updated

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,160
on the current with the corresponding

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,279
data on the right side

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,000
and you can even drag and selecting drag

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,160
the selecting area to move around

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,959
and see other parts of the data on the

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,279
map and observe the changes on the right

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,279
side

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,000
and what's and what's more exciting

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,720
about this is that

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,720
this brushing and connecting logic is

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,519
very easy to implement

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:38,000
if you are using apache in chats because

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:41,200
it does all the underlying works for you

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,320
can see that at stage 3 we already

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,600
have quite complex abilities to make

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,440
charts of different

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,760
styles your imagination of what you want

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,480
to

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:56,320
make with these features is really the

00:12:52,480 --> 00:13:01,040
limitation of what you can create

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,040
so how can we even do better after this

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,440
well apache each has answered this

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,040
question

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,519
with storytelling to tell the story

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,079
behind

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,079
the data

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,000
with the upcoming hrsv5 you can make

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,720
this far raising effect

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,800
to tell the story of how data changes

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,680
over time

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,959
this is an example of average life

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,240
expectancy

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:32,959
of different countries and regions

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,560
instead of using several static charts

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,959
or varied ears

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,639
this bar raising effect can make it

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,680
easier for users

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,560
to have instant impression on how data

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,440
changes over time

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,000
we also plan to make a tool for users to

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,160
make this kind of charts with gui

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,160
so that no coding is required

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,519
similarly etras v5 also comes with line

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,800
raising effect

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,600
which also is used for showing the data

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,320
changes over time but gives extra

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,000
information

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,000
on the overall tendency

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:20,399
another useful feature for storytelling

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:22,880
is morphing effect for custom series

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,519
as we introduced earlier each has

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,480
provide

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:29,680
custom servers to let users define how

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,480
their special charts look like

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,880
and what's make and what makes it cooler

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,920
here

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,079
is that you can soon create morphing

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,199
effects like this with each

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:44,720
custom series and tell the story

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,320
of how data in one chart type transform

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,199
into another

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,839
or the aggregation and composition of

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,839
the data

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,360
what stage 4 differs from 3 is that it

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,760
provides more complex methods

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,519
to tell the story that cannot be done

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,000
otherwise

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,160
by providing these methods we wish to

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,880
make it easier for users to

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,279
tell the story behind data rather than

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,480
just

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:18,160
showing the data it's not just

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,600
for declaration but by accentuating the

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,680
impact of data

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,600
you can let people learn the story

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,720
photoshop and hopefully

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,360
take actions to for the change for the

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,959
better

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,959
after seeing the charts you make

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,399
and that's what we wish to do with

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,759
providing

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,959
powerful yet easy to use story telling

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,880
functions at this stage it may be hard

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:48,160
to tell where the next stage

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,959
goes with that of it but as the saying

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,360
goes

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,639
the best way to predict the future is by

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,800
creating it

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,360
we are working continuously to make

00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,240
database tools easier to use

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,399
while keeping its flexibility and i

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,800
believe database is playing a more and

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,199
more important role in the future

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,440
so now is the best time to dive into

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:13,199
apache charts if you have not

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,199
and tell a story of your own

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,120
in conclusion we introduced the history

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,240
of

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,680
how database tools evolved with

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,720
the examples of e-charts and explain

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,839
the motivation and considerations behind

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,880
it

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,800
one thing we need to know about is that

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,480
these stages does not take place

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,120
linearly and may

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,519
probably overlap each other with certain

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,519
tools

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,120
and that that is pretty much i'd like to

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,600
share today

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,720
and i will take questions now and you

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,720
may send me an

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,720
email if you prefer to thank you

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,440
thank you justin

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,039
do you have any questions or you may

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:19,839
also

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:19,839
send me an email for that

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,840
yeah these all the examples that i

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,720
share in the slides are written in

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,840
e-charts

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:37,760
in javascript and i record it

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:41,360
with a video and you can visit

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:47,840
etra's website to see more examples

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,840
i will send the links now

00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:01,840
these are all the examples with a charts

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,160
yeah i i've also tried with graphna e

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,840
charts

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,320
it's not very good to use and i think

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,600
more community help is required with

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,480
that plug-in

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,720
so that you can bring more features from

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,080
each house to graphnap

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:30,240
with graphner e-trust you may have to

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:33,679
write a lot of code but other graphic

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,160
components do not require so and the job

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,080
is

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:43,840
mailing down in gui so

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,840
maybe you can contribute to that project

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:52,320
so eric's question

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,000
what inspired creating a new charting

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,240
library

00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:01,440
back the year 2008

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,880
there are not that not very not

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,640
many chart libraries that is

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:11,679
flexible and functionary enough for

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:15,280
the requirements we we need

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:18,640
to use in our work so an engineer first

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:21,440
created this library and

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,200
by comparing with other charting

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,120
libraries

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:30,559
each us is open source and free to use

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:33,120
and have so many chart types and

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,640
the big data rendering all those

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,080
features we provide

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:41,200
we hope to involve more people

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:45,120
to get to use this all great

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,120
features that each us provides

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,440
how charts are connected with source

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,720
data

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,760
you may you may provide data in many

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:03,200
forms for example you can write the

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:06,320
data in javascript like in arrays

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:10,000
which is the most simple ways

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:13,600
perhaps and you may also use ajax to

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,400
load the data from your database or

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,640
other methods that doesn't matter as

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,440
long as you get the data you

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,600
pass it to each other with javascript

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,120
you can use it with e-charts

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:35,840
so it does not necessarily matter

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:35,840
what what starter source you are using

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:44,159
so about automatic data with

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:48,320
i guess this means that you can

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:51,919
set the parameters in gui's like

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:54,559
uh how the colors of bar charts and

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,480
um they are how they maybe the stack

00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:00,480
bars or how they form

00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:03,840
actually we have tried with one product

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:07,440
which is very complex and we spent

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:10,880
a lot of time and effort on it and

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,919
one problem with that is no matter how

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,600
many

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:19,440
parameters we provide people will always

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:23,120
need more for they want to

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:26,080
configure all the options each house has

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,559
so maybe a better solution we provide

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,679
here

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:35,120
is that we hopefully we want users to

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,080
see the examples see or the examples

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,480
that

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,520
which is similar to what you want to

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,320
create and

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,200
you find a similar one and check out the

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,880
options

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,760
the object and we wish to make it easy

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,039
to

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,679
for people who are not very

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,799
good at javascript or other coding

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,080
languages

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,960
you can also change the examples of

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,640
others

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:13,840
to create your own charts this is

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:13,840
for now the balanced solution for us

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:27,840
thank you

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:41,840
and i can share my slides so that

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:41,840
you can see more links from it

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,919
you

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:51,840
and thank you for listening

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:05,679
thank you and if you have any problem

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,120
using e-charts you can also send emails

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:19,840
in our mailing list

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:19,840
the link is in the official website

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:33,840
thank you justin

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:44,960
yes there are extensions already

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:48,640
supporting many chat

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,880
libraries i can just send the link to

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,880
you

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:57,440
not google maps perhaps but there are

00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:00,799
several chat map services

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:04,000
like mapbox leaflet

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:07,679
and arcgis and you may also

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:11,840
create one with google maps based on

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,840
e-charts apis

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:07,679
so if you don't have any more questions

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,320
let's take this for

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,320
our end

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,760
thanks thanks justine for for that

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:37,200
yeah thank you justine bye bye
