	Advice to Incubator Mentors
Justin Mclean

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

So you signed up to become a mentor for a project? Do you know what it entails or what is expected of you? Your project is relying on you to help guild it to graduation. In this talk, I'll be giving an overview of the ASF incubation process, the pitfalls to watch out for, and how projects become successful. I'll focus on everyday situations and challenges that podlings face and what's a good way to deal for mentors to deal with them. This talk is is for anyone who is thinking of being a mentor, is currently a mentor or for projects wanting a smooth path to graduation.

Justin Mclean has more than 25 yearsâ€™ experience in developing web-based applications and is heavily involved in open source hardware and software. He runs his own consulting company Class Software and has spoken at numerous conferences in Australia and overseas. In his free time, he's active in several Apache Software Foundation projects, including the Apache Incubator, and is a mentor for a number of their projects. He's currently the chair of the Apache Incubator and on the ASF board. He also teaches at an online college and runs the IoT meetup in Sydney.

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,920
okay i'll get started hopefully a few

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,599
other people will

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,520
join us um just first off a little bit

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,079
about myself

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,559
i am an apache board member i'm the

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,800
currently the vp of the apache incubator

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,680
i'm outside of apache i'm a freelance

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,680
developer and

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,600
educator and i've been involved with

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,559
apache for for a long time mostly in the

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,879
incubator

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,960
pmc in recent years where i mento

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,239
several projects and i've reviewed

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,760
hundreds of releases um probably around

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,719
the five or six hundred mark

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,879
i've lost count at somewhere around the

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,239
400 mark

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,559
so um and i'm talking about the

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,840
incubators today and in particular

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,840
about mentors and

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,880
i'm going to give some advice to mentors

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,119
and and how they can help their projects

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,520
grow and become successful top level

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,520
projects

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,720
so first off just a little bit about

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,799
mentors and

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,600
that once a project joins the incubator

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,079
they generally have three or so mentors

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,960
and their chosen when the project starts

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,400
and the idea of a mentor is that it

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,360
helps guides the project

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,479
to to operate like an apache project and

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,799
follows them through

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,520
its journey from bootstrapping all the

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,520
way to graduation

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,720
mentors may change over time so you may

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,079
not start out with

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,320
the same mentors that you've finished

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,200
with

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,399
but we'll get to that a little later so

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,920
who can be become

00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,399
a mentor of a project

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,560
well currently it's only existing

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,040
incubator pmc members

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,320
but if you're an asf member you can ask

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,160
to join the incubator

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,840
pmc and you'll basically be at it

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,000
automatically

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,520
people who are not asf members can also

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,680
get voted on

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,440
onto the incubator pmc if you're

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,520
interested in becoming a mentor

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,720
you should just come by the incubator

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,599
general mailing list

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,959
and help out just vote on a few releases

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,720
help some users

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,239
you know do a few things along those

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,040
lines and it's very very likely that

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,760
you'll be

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,760
voted in as a member reasonably quickly

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,720
so what are the responsibilities of a

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,080
mentor

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,239
um basically they guide the project

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,840
through as i said from the very initial

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,640
stages of bootstrapping the project all

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,000
the way through

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,319
graduation um and basically your your

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,599
idea is to help nudge the project in the

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,959
right direction

00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:00,480
to make it follow and understand

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:03,840
uh isf policies and guidelines

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,280
help in creating and voting on releases

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,319
and then finally helping with with

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,720
graduation

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,319
and this can take some time it can be a

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,920
two to three year commitment and

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,920
sometimes it can be more

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,959
so i'm going to talk a little bit about

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,360
the apache way because that's

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,799
what you're really doing when you're a

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,319
mentor for a project

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,319
you're teaching the project about the

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,360
apache way and how to operate

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,120
according to these values uh

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,560
there are different versions of the

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,159
apache way i've

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,959
just put some of the values that i think

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,920
are important particularly to incubating

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,840
projects here

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,000
and i'm going to go through them one by

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,599
one

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,560
so the first one we're going to talk

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,720
about is charity

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,000
and basically the apache software

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,720
foundation makes

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,040
software for the public good at no

00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,040
charge

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,920
so that means that the the project needs

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,920
to operate in that way as well

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,920
uh so sorry about that looks like we had

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,840
a slight technical issue and i'm uh

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,840
back now

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:29,840
sorry let me just share the slides and

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:29,840
we'll continue on

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,040
right i'm going to have to probably skip

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,960
a couple of these slides

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,560
hopefully we still have some people here

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,440
yep we're good so sorry about that

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:56,800
interruption

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:58,720
and we'll just continuously on

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,080
so um the apache way is also about

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,280
community so

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,120
you know we have a saying called

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,520
community over code

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,560
and this means a lot of thing the two

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,600
most important

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,800
things here is that we want a diversity

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,840
of people that are working on the

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,400
project

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,840
and the project is about individuals not

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,600
companies

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:22,160
um we also have responsibility that is

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,840
that is earned um and that we want

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,840
discussions on the mailing list

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,479
so about that responsibility that is

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,479
being earned this is

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,160
often referred to as merit and

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,320
individuals gain merit by contributing

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,560
to it to a project

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,240
and the usual thing is that users become

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,840
contributors become committers become

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,080
pmc members

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,080
um and we want to see that the the

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,080
project is doing this

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,080
before it can can graduate

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,560
i won't go into what the various roles

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,680
are there um these slides will be

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,720
available

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,120
after the thing because we we just lost

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,160
a few minutes there

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,560
um and the whoops sorry and

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,479
the last two things there is the one

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,199
that is that the project needs to

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,479
operate in

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,560
an open way uh so that everything is

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,280
available for the public

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,600
um a code is publicly available as well

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,880
all

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,000
discussions are made in the open

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,080
and it's important that these

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,880
discussions are also archived

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,639
archived and they're searchable so that

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,680
new users can actually see

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,560
how past decisions were made and

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,960
and see how things have been done as

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,840
well

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,120
so this acts as a repository for the

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,639
communal knowledge

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,080
of the of the project um the other thing

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,680
is that these discussions that need to

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,840
be asynchronous and this

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,720
means that it gives a chance for

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,560
everyone to be involved

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,479
so that people don't have to be working

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,280
full-time on a project or they don't

00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:03,840
have to be in the same time zone

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,840
to be able to know what's going on

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,840
um and the last one is that the

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,360
project's worth by consensus

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:14,479
consensus so that all decisions are made

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,360
by people agreeing on a way forward

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,080
they may not agree that this is the best

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,360
thing to do

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,599
amongst all of them there may be some

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,720
even some disagreement but at least they

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,080
think that this is the way that the

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,880
project can move forward

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,479
with the least amount of conflict on the

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,319
project

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,080
so it's a generally good idea that just

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,520
use minor consent

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:39,120
lazy consensus for minor decisions so

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,080
uh you know even down to just committing

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,479
some code

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,199
that's in most projects is usually a

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,879
lazy consensus

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,080
or you know updating some documentation

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,879
or things along those lines

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,680
so if you follow all these values it

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,800
basically ensures that the project

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,520
is vendor neutral so it's not controlled

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,319
by

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,879
one company and that people are acting

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,080
as individuals on this project

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,840
not who they work for it also means that

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,960
you get a diverse bunch of people

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,199
that that can be diverse along a a

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,879
number of axes this can be from

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,680
different backgrounds

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,680
uh can be different skill sets they can

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,120
be working from different companies

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:28,960
they can be from different cultures

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,680
as well so um it also means that

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,000
people have trust in the project because

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:39,120
they know that the project is following

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,800
all of the asf policies and guidelines

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,479
they know that the releases that they

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,040
have made have made

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,600
have gone through some vetting process

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,200
uh

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,720
and this means that

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,920
people are more likely to use our

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,399
software the other thing that it ensures

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,000
is

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,680
that the project's going to be around

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,279
for a long time um

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,800
people will come into a project they'll

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,080
do some work on it and then they may

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,240
leave

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,160
and that's fine this constant renewal of

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,040
adding new committers and adding new pmc

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,480
members

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,399
means that the project

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,720
hopefully will keep going and going and

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,160
going at some point in its life you know

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,200
all things come to an end and the

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,200
project may retire

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,839
so next i'm going to go through some

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,080
common issues uh

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,440
that i've seen projects run into and

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,800
some suggestions on

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,800
how to deal with them

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,680
um and i've got um i've got a list of

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,640
ten 10 hopefully we still have some time

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,160
for some

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,760
questions after this and if there's any

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,080
other issues you want to bring up i'll

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,680
try and give some advice on on how to

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,320
deal with those

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,440
just before i get into these i'm going

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,399
to mention that

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,360
these are guidelines not policy and

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,880
they're probably not even

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,760
even calling them guidelines is probably

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:03,200
too strong a word

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,560
um projects work in a lot of different

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,120
diverse ways

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,120
and that there's

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,680
there's quite a a variety in in how

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,079
programs

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,800
operate for example some projects set

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,000
the commit

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,079
bar very low and if you make a couple of

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,959
contributions to a project uh you'll be

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,480
given made a committer straight away

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,320
other projects you have to basically

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,200
make 100 pull requests and work full

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,279
time six months on the project

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,240
there are two extreme ends of of a

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,160
spectrum

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,279
uh uh hopefully your project is

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,680
somewhere in the middle there

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,240
uh even towards the low end as far as

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,399
the the committee bar goes

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,120
uh but you can see there already that

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,560
quite a lot of diversity there

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,560
and there's also quite a number of ways

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,760
to interpret the apache way

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,279
and it means different things to

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,320
different people so you are going to get

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,000
projects that

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,000
are doing it differently

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,320
so just going through those um one of

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,519
the most

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,680
common issues um is that

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,200
projects uh make a release they make a

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,160
release candidate they vote on us on

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,640
their own list

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,399
and then they put it up on the incubator

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,320
uh general list for a vote

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:20,320
and it can't get the number of votes in

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,360
the reasonable amount of time um this

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,320
used to be a

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,600
very big issue in recent years it's been

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,440
less of an issue

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,760
but we've had one or two issues recently

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,200
i've been noticing on this

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:37,200
um what you want to do and to help

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,200
the podling do get through this

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,040
is is try and simplify their release

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,839
process so it makes it

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,120
that the release is easy to check um

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,279
making a checklist

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,720
of what needs to be checked for releases

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,399
is a great idea and having that

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,639
published somewhere

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,079
this makes it much easier for releases

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,000
to be verified

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,120
and people who are not familiar to with

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,560
the project

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,279
uh can also check it um you can also

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,399
remind

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,000
uh mentors that it's their one of their

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,800
responsibilities is to vote

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,399
on releases uh and so you can ask them

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,240
to vote on releases

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,160
um and if they have or not available

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,680
um you can also kindly remind them the

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,160
incubator pmc's

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,839
members to vote on the releases as well

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,800
generally they're sending a mail to the

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,480
general list

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,760
with a polite reminder we'll we'll get

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,120
some action and you'll probably get

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,120
someone voting on your release in the

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,639
next day

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,160
if you have any questions as i go along

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:38,160
just please put them

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:40,880
in the chat there and i'll answer them

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,800
so also on the subject of releases oops

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,440
sorry

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,880
also on the subject of releases one of

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,279
the other problems that i've

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,440
currently run into is that a project

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,040
will make too many release candidates

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,560
now they'll make a release candidate

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,760
they'll test it they'll find there's

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,200
something wrong with it

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,079
they'll then make another one there's

00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,279
something wrong with that and they'll

00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,920
make another one there's something wrong

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,079
with that

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,480
i think the worst i've seen was 11

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,600
release candidates

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,839
hopefully your project doesn't make that

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,279
many

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:15,200
but uh there's a few

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,560
ways you can you can deal with this i

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,480
think the best way is to tell the

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,399
project just to slow down a little bit

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,839
and take more time to review each of the

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,040
release candidates

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,480
i'm going back to my previous point

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,480
make sure that they have a checklist and

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,639
they're following a checklist

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,000
when you're doing that the other thing

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,880
is that if you if you have this

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,040
checklist

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,079
make sure that you check everything on

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,000
the list

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,199
and not just get to a point find an

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,279
error and stop

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,440
because there may be other things that

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,279
still need to be corrected after that

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,639
and it's often better to try and fix

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,839
more than one thing in a release

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,000
candidate

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,000
so then you won't go through so many

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,160
release candidates

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,040
uh in the vote mails try and encourage

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,480
people

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,839
to say what was checked and what

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,199
platform that they

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:05,120
they checked this on so that can help

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,800
reduce the number of release candidates

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,240
as well

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,360
uh because it means if you know someone

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,240
knows that they've checked it on one

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,480
platform

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,000
uh they can check it on another one and

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,000
hopefully won't discover any

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,600
issues that don't exist on that that

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,639
platform

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,279
also make sure that the release process

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,560
is documented and that release process

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,720
is kept up to date

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,480
again you want to try and aim for uh

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,120
hopefully that someone who's new to the

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,519
project

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,720
could follow that release process and

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,720
make a release themselves

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:43,040
the other common problem that i

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:45,360
see with projects

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,959
is um sometimes particularly when

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,399
they're starting out they're unsure when

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,399
to recognize new committees

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,079
uh and this in part i think is because

00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:01,839
of the

00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:01,839
wide variety of projects that

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,040
the bar that they set for committer ship

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,639
as i was saying before some projects you

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,000
have to basically be working full time

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,800
for six months on them before you be

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,240
committed

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,160
and others you could just have to submit

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,199
a couple of pull requests and you're

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,480
likely to be

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:22,000
made a committer

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,839
so my advice for this is actually have

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,959
the project discuss what it means to be

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,120
a committer

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,720
and once that discussion has come to a

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,079
bit of conclusion have them document

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,800
this on their their website with

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,399
something

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,639
so it means that everyone has a clear

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,639
understanding of what it needs to be

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,839
committed and a pmc member

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,199
as well i would encourage people to keep

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,560
the bar low

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:46,800
um some projects

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,199
have this idea that you know their code

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,680
is precious and they don't want people

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,839
um breaking things but any commit is

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,480
just a reverter way

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,320
and if you have got good testing

00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,839
infrastructure then then it

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,480
it's not a big risk giving someone a

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,480
commitment

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,880
the other thing is to to encourage the

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,759
the

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,800
project to recognize all forms of

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,040
contribution

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,160
so not just code contributions but also

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,519
recognize people

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,800
who write tests who help users

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,040
who speak at conferences who run meetups

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,279
who write documentation

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,360
who create logos and do all the other

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:31,279
things that needs to be done

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,279
on a project other than just code

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,199
if the issue is that they have a high

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,240
bar to become a pmc member

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,680
and this is a project where there's no

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,040
separation between the committers and

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,519
the pmc

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,480
then it might be a good idea to break

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,240
those into two groups

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,480
um so that means that the committers can

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,560
have a lower bar than the pmc members

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,440
and it's easier to become a

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,839
committer uh one other thing uh you

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,880
could also suggest and i see this on a

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,639
few projects

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,000
is it's very easy to recognize the

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,240
people that come along

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,039
and are very active and and make a lot

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,199
of contributions in a short time

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,039
it's not so easy sometimes to recognize

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,439
the people who are committing in small

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:18,079
amounts over a longer period of time

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,360
so encourage people to to look through

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,240
uh you know the history

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,839
of commits and see who's who's in this

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,520
second group as well as the people that

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,439
are very easy to recognize

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,679
and hopefully they can become committers

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,679
as well

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,600
so another common issue is

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,720
that discussions are happening off the

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,160
off list

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,880
and not on the mailing list um and the

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,520
best way

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,080
to try and correct this is just to you

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,360
know encourage them

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,880
to talk on list and explain why it's

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,480
important

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,960
and perhaps i'll explain why it's

00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,320
important here and it's important for it

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,919
for a number of reasons

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,160
we want all people to be able to

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,880
contribute and people who are in

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,760
different time zones are not going to be

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,559
able to

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,679
maybe contribute uh into where these

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,280
other discussions are happening it

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,520
depends where these off list discussions

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,880
are

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:20,640
occurring of course uh you also

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,160
want to try and have more asynchronous

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,160
conflict

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,679
discussions because that means again

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,280
people in different time zones can

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,600
contribute and also means people who can

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,160
only work at a part-time or a hobbyist

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,200
can also contribute uh rather than

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,799
people who are just

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,039
working on it you know full-time

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,960
if if and now it doesn't mean that you

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,039
can't have these conversations

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,360
off list you know a lot of projects use

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:48,480
slack or something similar like that

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,200
to have have conversations on but what's

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,039
important

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,240
is that if these things are discussed on

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,240
that list that they're brought

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,240
back to the mailing list so that the

00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,559
wider community can be

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,559
involved and have input on that as well

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,080
another way that you can look into this

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,440
is

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,520
have some way of mirroring those

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,840
conversations to the mailing list

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,440
so that is also searchable and

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,120
archivable

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,799
so can people can easily find this

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,720
information

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,720
instant messaging tends to have a very

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,760
low information content it's there's a

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,000
lot of chatter

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,679
but not a lot of you know detailed

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,080
information

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,280
having people write emails means that

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,960
they're often

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,600
a little more careful with what they

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,799
write and it has more

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,799
information inside it

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,600
emails also are good for organizing

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,600
information so that the emails have

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,880
subjects and there's threading

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,520
so there's you know there's a lot to be

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:53,840
said for keeping this discussion

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:53,840
happening on the mailing lists

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,640
so um one other problem you might have

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,000
with the mailing list is that there's

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,120
too much talk happening on one of the

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,200
private lists

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,640
um this is pretty easy for remedy just

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,679
remind the puddling what the private

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,559
list is for

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,320
i.e it should be for matters of security

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,159
uh voting in new

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,000
committers and pmc members and if

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,760
there's any conflict

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,200
between individuals in the project and

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,799
just about everything else should be on

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,559
the death list

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:24,720
and this is you know part of the project

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,640
being open and transparent and that

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,480
anyone can come along and see that

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,480
information and join in and contribute

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,600
uh one other issue with um

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,240
mailing lists is that some projects seem

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,000
to send a lot of github notifications to

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,840
the mailing lists

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,200
and this can make it hard to follow

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,520
conversations

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,559
on there and for people outside the

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,559
project to to get involved

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,320
um so what you can do is you can you can

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,159
filter easily filter what messages are

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,480
sent to the the mailing list

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,159
um or you can even split that traffic up

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,520
to another modern message you can make

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,280
up a commits

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,600
mailing list was something along those

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,600
lines

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:16,400
one other issue that can come up is that

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,159
some projects like to have a synchronous

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,600
video meeting say once every couple of

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,320
weeks or once a month or something like

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,960
that

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,960
i would try and discourage that um why

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,080
it's a good idea to occasionally get

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,480
people face to face

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,960
and having a chat you know information

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,000
can be conveyed a lot easier if you do

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,960
this

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,400
uh it it does mean that other people

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,000
can't get involved and generally

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,679
you have the same issues here along with

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,679
time zones

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,120
or people who are not working full-time

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,720
on the project can't be involved in

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,760
these meetings

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,480
so if the project does want to have

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,840
these

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,320
to do these and there are a couple of

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:56,080
projects that do this quite successfully

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,360
then you need to make sure that

00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,360
that you can get as many people as

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,799
possible in involved

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,400
so you know they're not using some sort

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,760
of internal company system

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,559
to have these meetings that no one

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,960
outside that one company can access

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,960
um and encourage that that everything

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,240
that is discussed in these meetings

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,640
be brought back to the mailing list

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,520
and also document what's going to be

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,000
discussed

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,280
in advance so people are aware of it and

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,200
can contribute

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:27,840
even if they can't make it along to the

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,840
to the meeting

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,440
uh one thing that i've seen recently

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,039
which has become

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:38,559
a bit of an issue is that

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,280
projects that come to the incubator and

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,200
they may

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,600
and these are existing projects that

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,440
already have a web presence and so forth

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,200
is they may have some existing external

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,320
websites that has

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,400
information about the project um

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,520
it's really really important that the

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:59,039
pmc has control of these websites

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,919
uh and um you need to point this out to

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,240
the project

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,000
fairly early on i've seen recently a few

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,120
projects that have got to the point of

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,880
graduation

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,559
and these issues have come up and it's

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,960
it's stalled that graduation

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,919
or it's delayed by it by a few months

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:17,039
while they've tried to sort this out

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,600
if possible you want to make it have so

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,400
that

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,760
the website is moved to af

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,080
infrastructure

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,039
and you also want the pmc to be able to

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,080
control that

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:30,480
not just some people from a certain

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,480
company

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,280
a good idea is to basically get rid of

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,520
the site altogether and just have the

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:41,120
domain name and have it redirect

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,720
to the apache site uh and as i said just

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,240
don't leave this just to just before

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,240
graduation because it's gonna cause

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,520
cause some issues so during your journey

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,720
of the you know

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:55,520
typically one and a half tooth sometimes

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,720
longer of becoming it um you might find

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,360
that some of your other mentors have

00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,360
gone missing

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,520
so there's a few things that you can do

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,960
to does like this help this um

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,640
the first thing would be try and select

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,320
the right mentors mentors in the first

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,039
place when starting out

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,360
uh look at their track record and how

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:16,320
involved they have been in other

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,000
projects that they have mentored um and

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,520
in particular if they're a good fit for

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
the technology or the project

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,799
um now sometimes people may just go

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,360
missing

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,880
in you know for for one reason or

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,000
another for for a month or two and then

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,000
they're back again

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,760
so certainly reach out to them and ask

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,480
them you know what what's what's going

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,559
on

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,760
and and are you if you're still

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,279
interested in being involved in the

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,039
project and can you still

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,200
you know perform the responsibility of

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,720
being a mentor and quite often you'll

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,760
just get an answer back that says oh no

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,440
you know i just you know

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,679
my family's just had a new kid or i've

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,080
just moved house or i've got a new job

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,679
or

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,720
something along those lines i mean all

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,080
these things happen to us it's

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,799
particularly in the space of a couple of

00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,400
years

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,640
there can often be some some major

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:04,080
events in someone's life

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,360
um so hopefully that this is a temporary

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,760
thing and they'll be able to come back

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,159
and and help with the project again

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,000
um if they can't do that then you really

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,440
need to find some new mentors and it's

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
it's better if you do that earlier

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,559
rather than

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,520
later and the best way to do that is

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,799
just to

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:23,200
come back to the incubator general list

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,159
and ask for them and and hopefully

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,840
you'll get some

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:29,840
people who are interested in helping out

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,640
so another one i got here which has come

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:39,039
up a few times

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:41,679
is that sometimes projects want to

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,240
seek an early exit from the incubator

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,760
before

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,799
they are perhaps ready the first thing i

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,320
would suggest in

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:52,559
in with this is to working out

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,640
why they want to graduate and

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,720
occasionally this sort of sort of set

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,679
is is meant to be in line with some

00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,960
artificial

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,960
deadline like there's a conference

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,799
coming up or they've got a new

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,080
uh they're going to make their 1.0

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:10,400
release or something along those lines

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,960
um and you know just try and make it so

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,320
that those

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:17,760
two things are not connected together

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:20,559
if a project is getting close to being

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,600
graduation or war is is still not but

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,320
still not being ready to

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,600
graduate then provide feedback on the

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,679
podlings report

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,480
um all mentors sign off the report

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,679
uh quarterly once once a project gets

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,120
established

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,480
um and there's space to leave comments

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,279
in there so you can add some comments

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,360
and say

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,400
uh you know well that you you know great

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,080
progress so far

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,480
but you know we still need to do some

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,840
work on making a few more releases with

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,880
some different release managers with

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,520
something along

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,520
those lines

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,400
um also encourage the project to fill in

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,960
the maturity model

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,760
uh it's not a compulsory thing but it

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:03,360
gives a good idea of where a project is

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,880
um and what gaps they can

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,559
need to fill so you know have them

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,559
reflect on that and

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,159
it may be that some of those gaps

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,760
hopefully some of those gaps will appear

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,200
and be quite obvious to them

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,880
um and that actually shows that they may

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,960
be closer to graduation

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,120
than than you may have thought that they

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,799
were

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,440
so that's it from me on um my advice to

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,640
mentors

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,120
are there any questions if so just type

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,760
them

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,039
in the chat there or if there are any

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,080
other issues that

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,600
mentors have in common encountered with

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,000
with podlings and wanted to discuss

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:49,840
those please mention those and i'll see

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:49,840
if i can offer some advice on that

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,720
yes as paul's is saying there please

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,360
sign up a mentor if you want to

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,640
help out the incubator and um i have to

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,159
say one thing about

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,919
being a mentor is that you'll learn a

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,120
lot yourself you'll learn a lot about

00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,840
how

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,960
the isf operates you'll learn more about

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,799
the policies and

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,960
procedures in the asf and you'll also

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,039
you know it's a rewarding thing helping

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,039
a project

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,840
from its start all the way to becoming a

00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,840
top level project

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,919
i think we still have five minutes for

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,240
questions

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,919
that if we don't have any i'll we'll

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:59,840
call it a day and i'll let you go on

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:59,840
to your next session

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,880
okay i don't think we have any more

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,200
questions so we'll just leave it as it

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,640
is

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,640
thanks everyone for coming along to my

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,840
