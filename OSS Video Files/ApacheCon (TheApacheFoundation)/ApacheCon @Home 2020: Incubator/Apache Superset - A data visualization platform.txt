Description: 
	Apache Superset - A data visualization platform
Maxime Beauchemin

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

This talk explores Apache Superset through a live demo, and provides a high level understanding of what it offers as a product. We'll also share our journey thus far, and explore what it takes to grow an open source project, a community and a movement. We'll look at a retrospective of the design decisions, technology choices and engineering challenges that have shaped Superset. We'll also take a deep look into the current challenges the community is currently facing, and peak at what is ahead.

Max Beauchemin has worked at the leading edge of data and analytics his entire career, helping shape the discipline in influential roles at data-dependent companies like Facebook, Airbnb, Lyft and Yahoo!. A leader in the open-source community, Max is the creator of Apache Airflow, an open-source tool for orchestrating complex computational workflows and data processing pipelines and Apache Superset, a popular open-source data visualization, exploration and analytics platform. More recently he founded Preset, a company devoted to building upon Superset to offer next generation analytics as a service.

[Music]

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,720
cool so let me get started here

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,480
and i'm gonna try like we're a small

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,120
group of people so i'm going to try to

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,640
make it a little bit upbeat today i've

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,120
got some coffee i've got a coffee

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,160
machine

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,320
behind too so

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,480
i'm going to try to have some some good

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,160
rhythm here

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,160
if someone can tell me to how much time

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,680
is allocated i'm assuming like half an

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,399
hour i'm not sure exactly how much time

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,360
i should leave

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,360
for questions but i'll uh i'll keep an

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,800
eye on that maybe justin if you can

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,879
40 minutes perfect so i'll try to keep

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,760
the talk like 30 to 35 minutes and then

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,399
we'll have time for

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,280
questions it looks like there are ways

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,080
for people to

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,360
maybe ask questions in the polls section

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,000
um

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,280
so whatever mean you have at least like

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,799
think about your questions write them

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,280
down i'll try to keep an eye that i'm on

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,119
two

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,759
tabs now so um i'll try and take

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,439
questions

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,600
at the end i think that's gonna be

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,640
easier

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,439
cool um so apache super set um so

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,799
apache superset is a data visualization

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,079
platform my name is max

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,799
i'm the original creator uh of

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,720
apache superset uh originally was called

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,920
panoramics and then caravel

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:41,360
and ultimately uh was renamed as

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,000
apache superset and today we have a

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,880
pretty

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,640
simple agenda uh i'm going to do a demo

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,640
it's probably the most important

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,280
or more interesting part for the people

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,000
that are new to superset

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,320
i will talk about the past the present

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,360
and

00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,000
the future of superset uh

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,920
and and try to touch all the everything

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,759
that's relevant to the crowd here so i'm

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,000
assuming we have people from other

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,040
apache software foundation communities

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,399
too so

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,080
we'll i'll talk a little bit about some

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,599
of the things that we're doing

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,520
around the communities that we can uh

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,360
that that can be reproduced to but and

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,879
and imitated by other

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,360
communities at apache um so this first

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,920
slide

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,879
is a bit of a self intro so a little bit

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,239
about me

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,680
um my name is max i'm just uh

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,000
passionate about building data tools

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,840
that's what i've been doing in the open

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,280
mostly under the umbrella of the apache

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,959
software foundation over the past five

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,720
or six years

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:43,120
um i originally started i'm the original

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,720
creator of apache airflow that i started

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,680
at airbnb in 2014

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,280
and a year later i started apache

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,760
superset at airbnb

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,640
2 as a hackathon a three-day hackathon

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,440
project

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,360
originally it took a year or so before

00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,840
it got traction and we kind of staffed

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,040
it

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,080
and really kind of uh sponsored it at

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,640
airbnb

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,840
and since then i've been working and

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,400
focused very much on superset full time

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,200
and kind of dedicated my my professional

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,040
career to

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,120
uh to superset over the past five years

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,599
um more recently so a little bit more

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,080
than a year and a half ago i started

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,799
founded a company that's called preset

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,280
that is a superset centric company so we

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,640
build

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,840
in and around apache superset we offer

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,720
superset as a service and we also

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,280
um we offer you know service and support

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,080
training

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,599
um all that good stuff on everything

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,840
superset or related

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:48,080
in in a way or another to uh to the

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,840
project um i worked at a bunch of

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,200
data forward companies that you see in

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,560
this slide um

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,560
so worked at lyft airbnb facebook yahoo

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,720
ubisoft i wanted to say i'm super

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,879
grateful for these companies that are

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,480
sponsoring open source projects and

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,680
letting people like me

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,799
uh grow communities and build open

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,480
source software

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,000
i think it's amazing that we're doing

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,319
that i think it's amazing that we have

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,760
the apache software foundation to enable

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,079
a lot of that too and enable that

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,600
transition from company to company

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,400
while keeping working on the same

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,400
project right when i went from airbnb to

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,120
lyft that was a really smooth transition

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,600
and effectively i was still working for

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,479
uh

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,800
for for airbnb in many ways through

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,360
through

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,919
open source so i'm very grateful for

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,919
that

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,160
on the left panel i took my profile

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,120
picture from our profile page from

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,360
github's on mr crunch on github

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,520
that's been my home base for a little

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,560
while between slack and

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,000
github so spend spent a lot of time just

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,520
working collaborating people

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,280
with people directly on github

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,199
let me just check at the comments here

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,000
to make sure that no one is

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,199
writing something like we can't hear you

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,520
or uh

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,880
uh so it looks like everything is going

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,880
if people don't complain

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,320
in the chat i'll assume that everything

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,759
is going well

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,000
i see we're about 30 people now cool

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,759
back to the slide so um so apache

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,199
superset is a data visualization and

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,720
data exploration

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,560
platform uh it's very much a a full-on

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,000
kind of web application

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,000
where that you can install in your

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,840
organization connect your databases it's

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,199
very much a uh an alternative to things

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,440
to proprietary tools like tableau looker

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,919
chartio right so it's a place where you

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,120
can connect to your databases perform

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,520
all sorts of analysis visualize data

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,560
share data assemble dashboards

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,759
uh write sql so

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,240
here you see a little bit of the gallery

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,120
if you go on our website at

00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,400
supersaid.apache.org you'll see the same

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,560
gallery and it's a little bit more

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,199
interactive where you can actually

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,160
zoom in to all these pictures so

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,360
superset is

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,520
dashboard and a dashboard dashboard

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,360
editor and a place where you can create

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,479
and share dashboards

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,000
it's a place where you can explore data

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,960
and kind of slice and dice and

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,720
you can web form you know drag and drop

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,199
style interface interface

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,560
where you can connect to different data

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,960
sets and

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,440
pick different visualizations apply

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,919
filters pivot you know so all this whole

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,720
like

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,479
code free slice and dice can analytics

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,919
at the speed of thought

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,759
um and it's also a sql ide where you can

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,360
kind of prepare data sets

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,280
uh write some sql so do things that um

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,560
are a little bit harder to do in the

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,120
slice and dice type

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,919
interface uh where you can you know join

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,120
data

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,960
create data sets union data sets um

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,720
and all this good stuff and it's also

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,280
possible from here to

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,120
pivot into the exploration mode where

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,000
you can visualize things and assemble

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,440
dashboards from sql

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,880
um it's also geospatial so um i spent a

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,919
year at lyft with an

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,520
amazing team there working on real time

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,440
and geospatial

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,440
so we got a good integration with a

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,800
super cool library out of uber that's

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,319
called decgl

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,319
and we built all sorts of awesome

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,919
geospatial integration features inside

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,919
superset i think i'll be able to show

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,960
that a little bit during the demo

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,800
um superset is also many visualizations

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,720
um so that we have this long tail of

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,319
visualization it's a bit of a patchwork

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,720
of all sorts of d3

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,520
and different libraries visualizations

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,319
that are made

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,919
viable under the same umbrella and

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,199
recently i'll talk some more about that

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,919
but we

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,520
kind of formalize an interface for

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,919
visualization plug-ins so

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,599
so that's a way that you can extend

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,199
superset

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:51,199
with plugins that suit your needs

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,360
something that i'll i'll get back to

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,720
plugins in a moment

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,440
and also so um so superset is also

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,360
a full-fledged web application so that

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,039
means you can kind of pick your

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,879
authentication scheme whether you're

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:09,440
interested in things like

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:11,360
uh rbac open id username passwords

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,360
and set your own role based access

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,599
control so we have very atomic

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,280
maybe two atomic permissions scheme

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,720
where you can really define what

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,879
different people can do in the

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,639
application and what data data and data

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,919
sets they do have

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,240
access to through superset

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,440
it is also cloud native so that means

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,599
you can run it

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,519
on the database of your choice for the

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,719
metadata database whether it's postgres

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,159
or postgres

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,719
or or postgres or maybe mysql but uh

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,599
but yeah so you can pick you know uh the

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,320
different uh

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,680
pieces of infrastructure you want to run

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,640
superset onto

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,040
uh which web server you want to run

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,240
which

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,120
message queue uh and uh

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,600
which caching mechanism you want to use

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,480
for

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,760
the data sets um it is extensible

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,640
through plugins

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,279
uh what i was gonna say here is that

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,560
with these plugins you can build

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,480
you can add new visualization but you

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,800
can also build like little applications

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,560
as

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,839
plugins which is really interesting so

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,040
you can do things that are more

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,720
sophisticated

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,480
uh we're really curious to see what the

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,920
now that we formalized the interface to

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,560
see what the community is going to come

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,560
up with

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,160
i think we should be seeing like more

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,480
specialized visualization maybe like

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,440
genomics or maybe things that are very

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,080
um industry specific so we're excited to

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,680
see the

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,080
the ecosystem of plug-ins growing um

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,519
it is also increasingly and that one is

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,600
a little bit more inspirational but a

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,920
platform to build data products

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,800
so that means that superset exposes its

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,920
building block

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,000
to do other things with it uh including

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,680
if you wanted to tap into the superset

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,720
back end that knows how to talk

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:56,399
to analytics database it knows how to

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,200
handle things like caching auditing

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,200
authentication permissions right so if

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,040
you're building data products internally

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,880
you might want to tap into some of the

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,320
layers and the building blocks

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:11,040
that superset offers including i think

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,160
you know a set of react and

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:17,040
visualization components

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,160
um superset is also a thriving community

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,399
so this is the

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,440
insights page from our github and it

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,760
shows that we've

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,959
merged about like just about 200 pull

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,640
requests over the past

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:31,600
month which is crazy uh

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,120
it's the pace at which um we're

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,519
accepting contribution

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,320
is incredible we have all sorts of

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,680
people from different organization

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,680
most notably i would say

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:48,959
airbnb dropbox lyft preset we're uh

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,480
an increasingly large contributor uh to

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,120
the to the project

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,320
too and we have like just a lot of stars

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,519
on github

00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:01,440
uh and and everything is kind of up the

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:04,399
through the roof um in terms of like how

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,279
fast-paced this community is and at the

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:10,560
pace at which is growing

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,600
um here i wanted to talk about uh full

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,000
stack

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,240
open source analytics so it's really

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,839
interesting to see how

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,160
the apache software foundation and

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,600
beyond i think here i have mostly asf

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,480
logos but i have preso 2 which is part

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,720
of

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,160
two software foundations now which is

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,040
really confusing there's a little bit

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,360
of a fork in the presto universe but i

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,560
won't get into that i will just

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:40,800
i wanted to to bring up this idea that

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,600
um that now there's more offering in the

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,760
data space

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,440
with open source and open source and the

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,240
apache software foundation

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,560
uh sponsor or hosted projects are

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,240
becoming like an emerging stack

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:56,079
that covers uh most most of

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,399
uh people's needs right so i think in

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,399
some areas or you know historically

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,760
you needed a lot more duct tape and

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,000
chicken wire to kind of get all that

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,000
stuff to be working well together

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,200
but more and more these things are

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,399
playing well

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,560
between each other and they also play

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,079
well with the you know the cloud vendors

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,240
and the things that are more

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,680
uh up and coming and from the sas world

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,839
things like in our case you know

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,440
bigquery and snowflake that are

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,279
um growing fast so uh so so these

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,000
pieces of puzzles are all kind of coming

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,320
together in a really interesting way

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,600
and i think one thing i want to talk

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,040
about a little bit today

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:38,320
is open source up the stack uh

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,040
which i have a slide here on that

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,200
doesn't say much but i wanted to touch

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,920
on that topic which i think is is super

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,920
interesting

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,639
and and relevant and important to us

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,360
because we're a slightly different

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,680
community at apache where we're building

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,519
web

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,760
application and web uh web tools or

00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,959
tools that are heavily kind of

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:04,000
ux ui driven as opposed to

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,760
a lot of the the products um around that

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,760
are more infrastructure so we've seen

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,160
really

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,680
open source really take over and win the

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,240
infrastructure layers

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,120
things like databases compute engines

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,399
orchestration

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,680
systems right everyone wants and desires

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,839
open source

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,120
down the stack and and i've been

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,079
wondering about

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,519
why we haven't seen as much open source

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,079
of the stack

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,399
and i've got some a few points i want to

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,360
touch upon today before i move on into

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,720
the demo

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,399
uh one is i think like part

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,320
to me like the value proposition of open

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,760
source is um

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,600
first it's a better way to write

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,720
software and that does

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,120
uh and to collaborate on software right

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,600
so

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,480
i think that carries up the stack nicely

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,040
um

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,880
and the the other idea is it's a better

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,480
way to distribute software too so as

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,399
someone who consumes software

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,560
you can kind of just get clone as

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,760
opposed to having to you know deal with

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,839
a vendor

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,199
and have to attend a webinar and get

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,279
spam to even

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,480
see a screenshot of the software right

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,440
so

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,199
so i think these carry nicely um very

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,880
nicely up the stack i think some

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,480
challenges that we've had in the past

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,199
that prevented

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,880
open source to succeed up the stack are

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,480
one is front-end engineering

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,639
was uh was not necessarily um

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,600
real engineering right so the toolkits

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,800
and the the

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,800
the jquery era was rough

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,040
and front ends were kind of patched

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,600
together and hard to

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,600
collaborate on i think now the front end

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,519
engineering has has come a super long

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,240
way over the past five or six years

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,519
where

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,560
with the rise of npm um es6 re-app

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:51,760
react type script um these things

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,199
are making front-end engineering real

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,279
awesome engineering that people can

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,720
collab like truly collaborate on

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,120
so that's one big shift and the other

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,880
one is integrating

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,560
i think open source has been really good

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,920
at taking engineers and making them

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,360
collaborate

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,440
but we've been bad at integrating uh

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,519
product managers and designers i think

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,760
designers being really the the key that

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,560
function of design is super important to

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,720
build ui

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,480
and ux and uh and open source and github

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,920
and our communities have been kind of

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,320
foreign to

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,600
uh to designers so at preset we're

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,000
really interested in

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,680
trying to solve that uh and within our

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,480
community too we're trying

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,199
to find many ways to integrate integrate

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,639
design

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,959
as a core function uh in our community

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,839
and

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,519
and not only offer it offer kind of

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,320
design as a service in the community but

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,800
also like

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,519
try to onboard more designers from uh

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,120
from other

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,279
organizations and get them to

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,959
participate

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,120
cool i'm looking again at the chat to

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,720
see if there is anything wrong going on

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,560
or if my internet's still

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,320
up and it seems like things are good so

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,519
i'm gonna keep going

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,040
uh and i wanted to talk here um a little

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,720
bit about

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,240
our published roadmap so recently we

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,839
published sip

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,800
53 so super set improvement proposal 53

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,839
uh which is our proposal to create a

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,680
public roadmap for superset

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,560
we looked around different communities

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,079
to see how other people

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,440
other communities are doing that and

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,959
found that very few communities are

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,720
publishing road maps

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,880
so we thought it was a good opportunity

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,320
to innovate a little bit on that so you

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,279
can find out more about exactly the

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,240
mechanics that we

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,160
were proposing to do this this is uh

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,240
ongoing discussions

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,759
today so we're going to be voting on

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,199
that over the next few days

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:46,240
but the general idea is that if any

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:49,920
any contributor committer uh pmc

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,320
wants to put forward road map items to

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,120
bring

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,720
into the um kind of the global roadmap

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,959
they're welcome to do so

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,959
uh the minimum requirement is having a

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,320
you know a title a scope defined and a

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,040
rough timeline

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,759
and um having an owner for the roadmap

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,199
element

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,039
and everyone within the superset

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,360
community is welcome to

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,360
not only contribute to this roadmap but

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,439
we find that it's an opportunity

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,880
to create more collaboration in the

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,520
community so knowing

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,280
where this project is going uh for the

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,280
same reason that you need an internal

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,160
roadmap for the products you develop i

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,039
think they're very

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,400
helpful at the community level uh there

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,160
too so i invite people

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,080
that are interested to check out our

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,320
public roadmap you see the github here

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,360
on the upper left so that's under

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,360
apache superset superset roadmap

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,720
and that's still in a proposal phase and

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,799
we're welcoming

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,840
people to kind of give feedback on the

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:46,000
process and

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:48,080
on the roadmap itself

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,240
um community so here i'm going to go

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,960
quickly through this we're already 20

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,640
minutes in

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,160
so i want to save a good 10 minutes for

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,000
the demo um so

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,760
community where here i would

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,600
characterize kind of what we're doing as

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,799
we're doing most of the things that are

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,280
expected out of a

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,880
large growing community so github is

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,080
very much a central hub we have a

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,280
thriving slack that's

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,039
always on we we do

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,799
committers meeting we try to accommodate

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,799
people in different time zone

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,840
and we welcome everyone to these

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,960
committers

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,880
uh meeting um that are

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,480
usually on fridays or thursday so if

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,760
you're interested in that you can tap

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,679
into our slack and and get hooked

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,440
uh with these committers meeting we

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,840
started a champions program so we found

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,280
it was

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,760
difficult for people to um to become

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,919
committers so the path to committerhood

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,600
um at apache i think can be

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,080
difficult depending on the community and

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,400
we felt like in our community we needed

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,160
an accelerated path and we wanted to

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,799
offer more direct support for people

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,480
that are like

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,000
i want to contribute but i don't know

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,039
where to start

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,960
um and i think really often at

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:59,440
apache this um i would call it like the

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,320
fostering committers it usually happens

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,440
within

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,840
sponsoring organizations uh but it's

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,760
hard to see the new organizations that

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,640
want to get involved and people really

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,679
need to

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,480
to push um there's this thing in open

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,000
source where

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,240
i think there's a lot of people that

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,799
feel the imposter syndrome they feel

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,720
like

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,000
this is a kind of big stage that's hard

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,520
to get into

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,200
and that people are going to judge them

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,280
so we really wanted to create

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,799
an on-ramp for people who wants to

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,320
contribute more

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,840
check out you can learn more about the

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,919
champions program

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,600
probably i would say on our slack to get

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,559
more information there's a channel

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,640
dedicated to this i believe we send a

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,720
monthly newsletter we've redesigned our

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,679
website we're doing uh regular meetups

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,039
so we're doing

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:48,480
um all the things that um

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:51,360
that you know great open source uh large

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,200
communities are doing nowadays and to

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,400
find links to these resources

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,160
i would say go to superset.apache.org

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,720
there is a community page

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,679
that should have links to all of these

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,440
resources and more

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,440
cool so demo so let's see how this goes

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,520
last time i was on i think i was running

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,159
local this time around i'm not running

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,679
local and i believe i'm gonna have to

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:18,320
come here

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,320
and share another screen here

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,320
um so chrome tab i'm sharing different

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:28,000
tab

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:30,640
and it should be right here

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
so now i'm going to ask you do you see

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,320
my screen the question

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,039
of uh i was gonna say the hour of the

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:40,320
past six months do you see my screen

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:42,000
yes great all right now i can keep going

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,440
all right so now i landed on the welcome

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,480
page of superset this is a list of

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,720
dashboards so

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,320
i think i'm gonna take you very quickly

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,120
i'll just pop a few dashboards so

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,320
starting with

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,520
um our community metrics this one i

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,640
built this weekend

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:59,280
on top of big bigquery open data uh

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,320
just for fun and i think i'll start with

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,240
just these two

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,000
dashboards oh and i pop them in

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,039
different tabs so that's not gonna work

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,120
so i'll just

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,679
not pop them in different tabs and just

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,679
navigate

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,960
all right so this is our super set

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,919
community metrics

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,159
dashboard and i know that hop in takes a

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:25,280
lot of resources here so i don't

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,640
know how well that's going to go and i

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:31,840
don't think i have a fallback

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,840
do i

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,440
all right it looks like we're we're

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,559
loading slowly uh usually these

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,640
dashboards look

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,679
load pretty quickly let me just look at

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,559
my

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,039
top console to see how my cpu google

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:47,039
chrome

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:48,799
is at you know 200 percent

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,440
all right so we're good i think that

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:54,720
should go pretty well okay maybe

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,320
all right um so this of course i tested

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,280
and it worked very well before hopping

00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,840
on so

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,679
let me do a little bit of a tour here so

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,679
uh so here you can see that we have like

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,159
you know these dynamic filters here that

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,000
uh

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,760
that we can apply so we have these

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,760
interactive dashboards

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,280
uh here digging into the community

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,760
metrics here you can kind of see the

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:17,520
different organization contributions

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:20,000
a number of prs to date star gazers

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,880
the recent leaderboard of people and how

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,440
many pr's and comments and reactions

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,600
uh you know we can see over the past uh

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,600
who's has had the most

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,280
uh reactions or comments kind of

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,080
recently

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,240
uh let's see here so it looks like i use

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,840
reactions a lot personally

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,679
you can see the history of contribution

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,080
different people

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,840
tough issues so just a dashboard and

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,440
what you would expect in this particular

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:50,960
dashboard we have a little bit more

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,440
um of interaction where we can look on

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,000
specific you know people maybe and in

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,440
here let's

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,159
let me just gonna use uh myself and you

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,080
can see

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,400
you know activity from different people

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,080
um so that gives you an idea the kind of

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,440
stuff that the kind of dashboard that

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,440
you can build

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:13,039
here uh let me go to show another

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:16,720
dashboard or two so the other one

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:20,480
maybe i'll get into here is

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:23,520
uh i'll pop this one quickly

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,120
so that's uh one using bigquery oh by

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,840
the way going back to the community

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,000
dashboard

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,679
we publish a blog post or i publish a

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,159
blog post on the preset blog

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,840
around how to get to this exact

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,679
dashboard so if you're looking for

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,919
a short project you can kind of pick up

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,960
the

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,080
the notebook that i published and run

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,279
the same things and like

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,240
load the the information from your own

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:50,000
communities into a superset dashboard

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,720
and make it work

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,679
i would normally navigate to the blog

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,799
here

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,760
to show you maybe i'll point to a few

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:01,120
blog posts

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:04,400
while i'm here and then i'll get back to

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:08,720
this afterwards okay

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:12,559
so let me get the dog out here

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,559
all right luna get out of here

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,120
all right this is what happens when you

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,799
run a conference

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,480
uh from your home all right so here i

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,760
wanted to show that you know we have a

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,679
blog post that uh

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,200
that shares this open source dashboard

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,200
so you can kind of do the same

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,320
by you know running uh calling the

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,360
github api

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,000
and uh loading this that this dashboard

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,919
template

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,919
in your own local superset instance

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:46,159
cool um now

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:48,799
going back to the superset demo

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,760
um by the way i wanted to point out too

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,440
if you're interested in

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,279
visualization plug-ins we have this

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:57,039
awesome um

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:58,880
post as to how to

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,240
put together plugins that's very

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,320
detailed

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,600
um that's the one here so if you're

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,760
interested in playing maybe you're

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,320
looking for a weekend project

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,760
or a full-on little project you can

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,159
create your own visualization you can

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,320
get to

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,520
hello world very very quickly and then

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,840
you know pick your own

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,720
npm libraries and and build your own

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:22,559
visualization on top of superset

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:28,960
cool back into the demo

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:32,080
i should be able to just go here

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,720
nice and i'll show you i'll flash um

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,279
one one more uh one more geospatial

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,279
dashboard

00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,559
uh let's see here so we're looking at

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,679
like random data

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,039
over san francisco here um but you can

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,400
see that we have like this nice kind of

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,840
3d engine to

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:53,440
um to run queries um going

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,760
to maybe a chart that's

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,919
maybe more typical of the kind of stuff

00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,880
that you would

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,240
do here um let's see what am i gonna

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,679
show you

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,679
maybe i'll go into

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,840
the world's bank data

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,760
here and then uh i'll show you so we've

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,200
been in the dashboard so far i didn't

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,080
show you the editor but you know you can

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,840
imagine we

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,360
i can click the headed button and and

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,960
move things around

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,720
now i'm going into this pops into a new

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,720
window which can be interesting let me

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,279
just share my whole

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,279
browser

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:42,080
application window sharing and i believe

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,080
this is chrome here

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,720
all right look at that we have the

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:52,610
tunnel going on

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:54,720
do people see my screen as i switch tabs

00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:57,120
[Music]

00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,919
i would love to get like a nice yep all

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,320
right

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,640
um cool so now i am more in a slice and

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,640
nice view so this is the place where

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,720
uh you know you point to a certain data

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,120
set right so we're pointing to

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,559
a data set here we can create some some

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,640
calculated columns we can see the

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,919
columns that's in that table

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,279
and we can uh switch to different

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,640
visualization type which i'll probably

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,399
do in a moment

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,279
and here i wanted to show how you can

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:25,200
easily point to different metrics

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,880
apply some filters so say in this case i

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,000
might be interested in adding

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:34,240
a filter on a region and say let's

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,159
only look at north america and we should

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,640
only see north american countries or i

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,640
can

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,919
remove this filter and say hey i would

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,039
like to group

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,919
uh group by region instead

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,600
um and visualize this and maybe i don't

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,960
know i want a

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:53,760
an area chart instead um

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,960
rerun this query and uh maybe i'm

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,960
interested to look at like what kind of

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,200
sequel was generated here and like

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,399
noticing that the sequel is a little bit

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,520
complicated i'm like where's their

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,600
subquery here

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,279
it's because of this little series limit

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,399
here where you can say like i only won

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,960
the top

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,840
n time series so we do that with a fancy

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,120
little

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,440
sub query there's also other all sorts

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,360
of

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,480
options here where you can label your

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,000
axes or

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:23,760
use different um color scheme

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,880
uh you can here i don't know i could

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:29,360
write time you know and uh

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,200
and you know remove the legend for

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,720
instance and publish this

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,240
either to an existing dashboard or

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,559
create a new one from here

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,600
uh or create a new chart from here so

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,720
that shows you a little bit like the

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,520
explorer

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,640
um i'll show you too how say like a

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,840
common thing

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,799
is you probably go from um

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,000
from from perhaps like a bar to a bar

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,080
chart or something like that

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,039
um so so all these interactions are

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,960
pretty

00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:57,120
easy and at the tip of your finger and

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,440
then the third part i'm gonna show you

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,039
is a sql lab so i showed you how you can

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,039
kind of view the query from here but you

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,399
can kind of go deeper so we've gone from

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,000
the dashboard to the

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,520
slice and dice view where presumably you

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,679
can answer some of your own question

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,240
create your own visualizations

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,880
and then from here you can go deeper

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,840
into

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,799
what we call sql lab which is our sql

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,760
ide so

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,480
from here you can go and navigate

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,279
schemas

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,039
so here we were looking at a table let's

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,399
just look at this table because it's at

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,240
my fingertips

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,320
and you can get some simple data for the

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,880
table and here you have a nice little

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,159
editor

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,640
where you know you have autocomplete and

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,559
um and and you're able to just write the

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,799
sql that you need

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,399
there's some more advanced features um

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,240
here i think it's disabled in this

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:47,279
environment but you can schedule share

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,480
save you can also parameterize your your

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:53,679
um your sql

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:56,159
if you're working on maybe like uh

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,919
airflow script that uses parameters like

00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,799
you know time bounds and things like

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,799
that you can

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:06,320
you can work on parameterize sql

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:07,840
right in here so this is the very quick

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,320
tour so here you can manage your

00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,720
connection to different databases

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,159
uh manage your data sets you know upload

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,000
csvs

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,600
uh create of course like charts and

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,360
dashboard write sql

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,600
and uh and here there's a little bit

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,679
more around like data access

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,320
templates and other higher level kind of

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,159
concept that you can use and reuse

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,440
within the application so that's the

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,559
super short

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,440
crash course um what

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,080
is you know super set about so i'm going

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,279
to head

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,120
back into my slides here and i have a

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,960
few more slides before we jump into

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,080
questions and i believe i am

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,880
what 35 minutes since i've had a few

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,840
minutes so

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,200
we start we kicked off graduation

00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,640
recently um so i think we're

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,799
we're ready and we've been ready for

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,600
graduation so we started the process so

00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,600
this is

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,760
imminent uh so it's a matter of doing uh

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,320
the the paperwork i believe

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,480
or i'm hoping uh we're hoping we can

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,720
we're gonna graduate very soon

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,399
we started we were looking for a new

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,399
visualization library to have more

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,440
consistency and have a well-managed

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,200
maintained

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,440
um charting library that we use

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,519
consistently for the core visualizations

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,039
we found echarts which is another

00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,159
awesome apache

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,799
software foundation uh hosted project uh

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,600
that has

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,519
a lot of traction now too so we're uh we

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,320
connected with that team and it's really

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,440
great for

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,279
us to find another community that has a

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,600
similar governance scheme and that we're

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:38,240
very familiar with and we know we can

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,519
uh we can collaborate with and we

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,559
understand

00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,279
um how they operate we love like the

00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,640
guarantees

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,799
sometimes it's hard to offer the

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,240
guarantees that that we need to offer to

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,880
be part of the apache software

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,640
foundation

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,519
but it's really great to find projects

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,679
that do offer these guarantees too

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,799
we're working on superset 1.0 and it

00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,240
looks like the timeline

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:02,320
is until the end of the year or so

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,000
so there's a lot to do around quality

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,840
polish and usability

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,440
uh visualization plug-ins have been

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,799
shipped but the interface really needs

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,919
to settle

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:14,080
and 1.0 is where we're going to support

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,559
the interface you know for uh moving

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,240
forward and and prevent

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,760
you know make sure that we support

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,640
backward compatibility

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,279
uh security is a big theme um import and

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,080
export

00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:27,039
alerts and schedule uh deliveries of

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,200
report of

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,640
reports charts and dashboards and

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,360
there's just so much more there's so

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,519
much

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,799
product surface here that uh really you

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,919
have to take a look

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:40,240
at their road map that i linked that i

00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,440
mentioned earlier to see just kind of

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,480
how much

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,960
superset 1.0 covers and with that

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,720
i believe uh that is it so all the

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,720
resources that i mentioned

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,200
should be you should be able to find

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,519
through superset.apache.org

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,200
and we're really excited to welcome more

00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,519
people in our communities we want it we

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,799
want this community to be the most

00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:06,000
welcoming around so please reach out

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:08,320
and uh you know we're always happy to

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,159
um to onboard more people and find a

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,679
path forward for people to get more

00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:15,600
involved in our community cool so that's

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,159
what i have and that leaves this

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:21,679
i believe does that leave us any time

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,679
for questions yes five minutes

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:30,159
um where do i go do i go to the polls

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,399
no that's different so for

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,440
question i suggest people maybe copy

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,880
paste questions

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,760
in the chat um

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,440
and if all right awesome do you think

00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,559
superset is better suited with druid or

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,679
pinot for best

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:47,840
for best slicing dicing so um i've been

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,120
talking about uh analytics at the speed

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,919
of thought i think it's

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,960
really awesome where you can be engaged

00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,279
with a data set and

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,559
interact with it and ask the questions

00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,840
and get answers

00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:02,399
as you go for that you either need

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,399
a small data set or you need a database

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,799
that fits the size of your data set so

00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:09,679
if you have a really large data set

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:12,000
um and you want to get really fast

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,079
answers you'll need a fast database

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,760
or you'll need a bunch of summary tables

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,359
right that have been like prepared and

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,240
created for you so

00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:21,839
um so for a large i said as you hit you

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,280
know the the hundreds of millions or the

00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:26,480
billions of peros

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,159
um having kind of in memory uh reverse

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,480
bitmap index the kind of stuff that you

00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,159
know

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:35,119
druid and pino offer um

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,280
is great but if you have the data sets

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,760
that we expose or you know

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,119
um the ones i've been playing with i uh

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,079
say the covet data set

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,399
or like a lot of um toy data sets out

00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,720
there

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,240
are pretty small they fit in memory and

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,800
they're they're pretty interactive

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,560
even with uh with a small postgres

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,399
database so it really depends on the

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,520
size of your data

00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,040
um what you need but you know it's never

00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,800
a great experience to be working with a

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,760
tool like superset when the database is

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,160
just like

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,960
you know uh spinning and taking like 30

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,800
to

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:12,400
30 seconds to a minute the flow

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:16,560
of uh analysis really breaks down

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:18,400
quickly um let's see uh i'm gonna

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,400
try to touch on druids basically like

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,119
that our kind of founding story or the

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,800
create that the

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,960
the create the creation story of

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,800
superset was bound with druids uh

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,599
originally superset was designed as

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,160
uh won the first like open source druid

00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,760
ui

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,040
out there so that was before they

00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,200
released something called pivot that

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,520
they've pulled since then

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,880
right and uh originally we were really

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,040
coupled with druid

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,400
uh very early in the history of the

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,560
project we

00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,760
moved away from that are not necessarily

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,680
away we also

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,240
work very well with druid but we work

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:55,440
with just any sql speaking databases

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:58,640
very well we

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,520
work i would say very very well with all

00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,200
the popular

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,680
choices that people are making these

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,880
days so things like bigquery snowflake

00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,920
presto

00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,560
um even um

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,480
redshift is still fairly popular uh

00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,240
postgres my sequel

00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,160
we have a list of supported databases

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,480
and that's just growing but pretty much

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:21,920
any analytics database you can think of

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:26,079
we can connect to cool let's

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:28,480
see uh well will there be a first class

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,160
uh db support so that's a

00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,760
recurring question that comes all the

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,680
time people are like oh we have this

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,119
these big like you know document stores

00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,040
or um

00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,720
or like key value stores like things

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:42,480
like even

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,760
in the apache ecosystem you have things

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,079
like cassandra

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,200
you have things like you know hbase that

00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,400
are more

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:53,359
um key value stores with um

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,000
key range scan capabilities so so some

00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:58,079
of these

00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:02,000
offer um sql engine on top of it

00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,680
um for super set so we really the

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,920
the primary way that we connect to

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,480
things is through python's

00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,599
abstraction one is called db api so

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,640
that's the standard for

00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,880
writing a pyth a driver in python so

00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,320
that includes things like you know odbc

00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,599
and jdbc and uh and then we need to have

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,640
a sql alchemy

00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:24,480
dialect uh which is just like basically

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,720
adding a little bit of metadata on the

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,920
sql dialect around like hey how does

00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,520
this specific engine

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,440
do certain things like um quotes and um

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,640
and key like time functions and things

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,920
like that so

00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,960
um so sql is kind of the way we support

00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,200
very very well

00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,800
and then there's a custom native druid

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,280
connector which means you can write

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,000
pretty much

00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,480
any custom native connector but it's

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,960
pretty involved to do so

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,560
um there's there's all sorts of things

00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,480
that are possible here

00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,480
but you really need to have an engine

00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,880
that can do grouping

00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,000
uh and filtering and do the kind of

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,640
things that

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,720
sql does very well

00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,240
cool i'm looking for more questions here

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,520
as as there's also uh

00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:14,160
answers already um

00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,480
and i believe um let's see we started so

00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,839
we still have like five minutes or so

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,839
i believe

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,520
and if there's no more uh e charts also

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,920
does maps do you see a split or over

00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,880
overlapping geospatial we have not

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,079
evaluated

00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,160
very well like the e-charts map support

00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,640
and put a lot of work into deck gl so i

00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:39,760
think we're fairly committed to deck gl

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,040
at this point but the beauty uh with the

00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,440
plug-in ecosystem

00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,800
is that uh is that people can build

00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,119
their own plug-in packs

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,640
right so like right now there's there's

00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,640
a little bit of a question of like what

00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,480
is what are the core visualizations that

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,520
the super the core superset

00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:59,119
community wants to manage and maintain

00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:00,000
and uh and kind of uh make a first class

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,200
citizen

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,440
then we're assuming that out there

00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,560
there's going to be a lot of innovation

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,720
around plugins

00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,480
uh and that people are going to build
