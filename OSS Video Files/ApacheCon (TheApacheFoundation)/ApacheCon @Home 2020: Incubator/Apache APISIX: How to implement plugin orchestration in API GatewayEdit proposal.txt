Apache APISIX is a cloud-native API gateway that provides the same plugin mechanism as other gateways. However, in Apache APISIX, plugin orchestration is also provided that allows users to control the conditions and order for running plugins. Apache APISIX uses DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph) to implement this feature. In this share, we'll introduce Apache APISIX, and use a few examples to explain the advantages of plugin orchestration, and the specific implementation.
