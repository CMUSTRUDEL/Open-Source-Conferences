	How Container Schedulers and Software-based Storage will Change the Cloud - David vonThenen, {code} by Dell EMC

Persistent applications can be complex to manage and operate at scale but tend to be perfect for modern schedulers like Apache Mesos. The current trend in Containers is taking their ephemeral nature and turning it upside-down by running databases, key/value stores, WordPress, and etc within them. Internal direct attached storage and external storage are both options in running your long-running, persistent applications. The problem is how do you run these applications and containers in production environments?

This talk outlines how 2 Layer Scheduling, as known as the Offer-Accept model, found in Mesos and Software-based Storage enables deployment of managed frameworks and tasks while maintaining high availability, scale-out growth, and automation. This combination of technology will help build a ""Skynet"" like architecture for persistent applications and containers in the cloud.
