	Let's Encrypt ActiveMQ and Karaf! - Alexandru Zbarcea

Security in today's environment is a mandatory, implied feature of any production ready system. Securing a system happens at many levels, starting with the users and securing their identities, securing the endpoint via digital certificates, going all the way to securing backups and audit logs. All this is complemented by managing secrets at scale, updating and revoking certificates at runtime all while maintainging 100% uptime. This talk presents how we used "Let's Encrypt" a Linux Foundation collaborative project to complement ActiveMQ and Karaf security features to implements a secure, production ready messaging service.
