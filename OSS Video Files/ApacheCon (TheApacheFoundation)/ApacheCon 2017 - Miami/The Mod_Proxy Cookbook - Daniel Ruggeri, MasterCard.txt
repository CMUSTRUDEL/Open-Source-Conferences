	The Mod_Proxy Cookbook - Daniel Ruggeri, MasterCard

The extensive work over the years on the proxy modules has given httpd a degree of flexibility and intelligence that rivals some hardware load balancers. In this session, the speaker will discuss how a few features of different load balancing solutions line up and why mod_proxy/mod_proxy_balancer may be the best choice for you. After providing an overview of configuration directives, the session will begin exploring solutions to many problems that may arise in today's world of complex web applications and cloud-based systems where mod_proxy just makes it all that much easier. Complicated load balancing setups? No problem! Misbehaving backend applications? Child's play! After this session, the functional basis will be set for handling nearly any proxy situation you can think of.
