Description: 
	Introducing Apache Annotator (Incubating) - Benjamin Young, John Wiley & Sons

Apache Annotator (incubating) is one of the newest incubating projects at the Apache Software Foundation.

The aim of this fledgling community is to bring several disparate groups into the same room to work on collective code and content to help build a better foundation for the future of annotation on and off the Web.

We'll take a look at Web Annotation Data Model and Web Annotation Protocol, some of the past history of Annotation on the Web, and Apache Annotator's plans to build a better future together.

About Benjamin Young
Benjamin Young is a Developer, Web, and Open Source Advocate. Benjamin's focus is on content and how we human beings interface with it and each other around it. He currently explores the edges of a re-decentralized Web leveraging annotation--additional content added by anyone. Benjamin is currently a Solutions Architect at John Wiley & Sons where he works on Annotation and Digital Publishing with the W3C and various open source communities.

thank you for coming all of you we are

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,220
Apache annotator one of the newest

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,809
incubating projects it's on these really

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,480
cute PowerPoint slides that sort of look

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:15,360
like you know comment bubble so I'm

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,070
going to run with that this is going to

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,199
be a talk not only about the Apache

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,000
annotator project itself but kind of the

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,890
history of why it exists and how we got

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,710
there some of the stuff we hope to do

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:29,160
with it we do have some code I think

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,929
whereas like commit number 11 so just

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,649
getting that started we joined the

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:36,149
incubator in near the end of last year

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:40,110
but I have some history slides I'll get

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:43,020
to momentarily this is me at least

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,730
online I'm big blue hat my real name is

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,570
Benjamin young but that's a super common

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,760
name so this is how you can find me I

00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:54,090
did not write a book on dating I am NOT

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,649
a sports somebody I think you do soccer

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,020
player I don't know anyway there's lots

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,600
of Benjamin young I am a solutions

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,930
architecture architect for John Wiley &

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,149
Sons

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,939
which means I'm doing both open

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,700
standards and open source and that has

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:10,650
in turn gotten us to Apache annotator

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,750
which take a look at I'll be posting

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,159
these slides and these are links to all

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,729
the various amis and all the various

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,159
places so my history with Apache goes

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,740
all the way back to 2000 when I built a

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,380
site on Apache cocoon which is still not

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,990
in the Attic which is great people are

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,630
still using it it's an XML like this LP

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,610
pipeline processing thing changed the

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,689
way I thought about building web apps

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:39,570
and and CMS's content comes in one end

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:41,520
it goes through in number of pipes kind

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,880
of UNIX II and then goes out the other

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,670
end as HTML or SVG or a PNG or whatever

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,549
it's a super fabulous project I have no

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,380
idea where it is at now this is the

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,020
largest site I built at the time like

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,759
6,000 pages for University and it was

00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,509
great and then I left and they rerouted

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,500
the PHP you know whatever then there was

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,180
a gap where I was running my own

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,130
business and not heavily involved in

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,700
Apache I was too heavily involved in

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:11,370
Panvel and then I got into apache

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,920
couchdb and started contributing there

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,620
and spa

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,360
during events about caps TV was running

00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,670
my own business join some of the

00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,430
companies that Adam mentioned in his

00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:24,580
keynote yesterday was part of couch one

00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:27,880
became Couchbase left and did a CTO gig

00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:31,150
and then first startup and then joined

00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:33,730
cloud which became IBM are the other way

00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,200
around and yeah it's been great and

00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,900
somewhere along the way I got apache

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,650
couchdb committer access and haven't

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,569
really had time to use it 7 2016 which

00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,400
brings us up to late last year we

00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:47,560
decided to start apache annotator out of

00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,200
kind of what remained of the annotator

00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,750
j/s community if you've ever looked into

00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,299
doing highlighting type stuff on the web

00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:58,120
you found annotate ojs at some point

00:02:55,299 --> 00:03:01,180
it's pretty much abandoned and we'll go

00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:05,590
into how that all happened and our hope

00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:07,750
is to resurrect that in some form so my

00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,000
history with annotation includes finding

00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:13,030
Tim berners-lee's old documents called

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,790
design issues w3.org slash design issues

00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,829
if you're into the web at any level

00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:22,769
these are great things to read they're

00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:26,890
not specs they're more his thoughts on

00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:27,489
how he was thinking when he designed it

00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,280
in the first place

00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:32,380
or what he would like to see now and

00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,780
they're great they're all great

00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:39,549
documents the web axioms in there are

00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:41,320
super helpful URLs are opaque how many

00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:42,820
of you believe that it's great it's a

00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,769
super useful thing they're just strings

00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,570
that identify things but there's loads

00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:49,510
of stuff in there that can really help

00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:51,730
as you think through web development if

00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,650
you do that I hope you do I built from

00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,120
seeing the messages and lots of them and

00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,890
then I want to work for the hypothesis

00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,750
project and they're a open source

00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:05,049
nonprofit they build a MIT license

00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:07,060
annotation tool but it's governed by the

00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:08,859
nonprofit and it's mostly designed

00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,500
internally which is fine it's working

00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:13,720
for them and it was actually while I was

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,549
at hypothesis as their developer

00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,130
advocate that we decided to start this

00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:20,669
process of doing incubation at Apache

00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,650
around some of the core code

00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:25,409
so that there would be a longer-lasting

00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,120
community that could persist beyond what

00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:29,569
may or may not happen to the nonprofit

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,759
we hope nothing happens bad to it

00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:35,279
nothing is right now they're open to the

00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,289
right which is great so I'm a co-editor

00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,749
of the web annotation data model spec

00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:42,599
and the vocabulary specification at the

00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:44,610
w3c that happened also while I was at

00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:46,050
hypothesis had the opportunity to

00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:50,159
collaborate with the people there and

00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:52,860
design or continue the design of an

00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:54,509
annotation model that's very webby you

00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,629
can distribute these things and they can

00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:58,830
re-enter on stuff there's ways to do and

00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:01,529
we'll take a look at the documents later

00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,909
ways to have anchoring strategies to

00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:04,500
make sure that you can deal with the

00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:05,580
change of the document underneath and

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,250
things like that

00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,800
a lot of lot of thought and work has

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,210
gone into that I helped write the

00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,589
testing framework for the web annotation

00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,439
protocol which is a way to distribute

00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:18,479
the annotations and then join John Wiley

00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:20,969
& Sons about a year ago to help them

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,999
move their existing annotation

00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:25,949
implementation towards web annotation as

00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:32,430
well as continued standards work and do

00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:33,689
open source on and on so annotate ojs it

00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,789
was originally started by the Open

00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:37,849
Knowledge Foundation and then the

00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:41,520
hypothesis project started contributing

00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:44,550
developer time and trying to really make

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,339
that library be the canonical thing and

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:49,139
they built hypotheses around that but

00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:50,580
then very quickly realize that the

00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:53,240
architecture wasn't going to scale and

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,939
so they kept pieces of it and basically

00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,870
hypothesis is like a giant Fork of

00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:59,669
annotator j/s

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,979
in the meantime everyone else who used

00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:03,060
annotate OJS ended up working it because

00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:05,039
it didn't have a really great plug-in

00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,039
system at the time so if you really

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,500
wanted to do something idiosyncratic

00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:12,689
which as we learned collectively as a

00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,270
community everyone does annotation

00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:17,879
pretty idiosyncratically there are

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:20,669
reasons to do sidebars there are reasons

00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:25,110
to not do sidebars and do stuff in in

00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:26,879
the page so they they did a fork loads

00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,550
of other people that a fork shuttleworth

00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,959
foundation-funded the initial hypothesis

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,220
project also a bunch of people on

00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,980
Kickstarter did

00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,360
and these three gentlemen here are the

00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,190
ones that really got it started Nix

00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,770
tinning is responsible for like the

00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:43,110
first 50 odd commits on that and then

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:46,020
Aaron Carroll came along he now works

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:48,840
for Dropbox shortly after he joined

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:51,840
dropbox dropbox had comments maybe

00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:55,400
related I don't know if it is Randall

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,200
Leeds is also on the Apache annotator

00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,780
project and he is previously a

00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,060
hypothesis as well both of these other

00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,220
two guys are listed on the initial

00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,540
committers list and our proposal they're

00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,270
busy

00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:11,460
so we haven't seen them yet but the

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,790
busyness of these three guys is why

00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:16,560
annotator j/s ultimately failed besides

00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:19,770
the fact that it was forking there's a

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,990
big push at hypothesis to rewrite

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,610
annotate ojs as a new version the

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,770
hypothesis could get off with its work

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,410
basically and get on to a community

00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:30,060
built version which was annotator 2.0

00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:34,950
that there's still an outflow release up

00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:37,500
for Aaron and Nick are not Aaron and

00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:40,050
Nick and Randall banged out that

00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,300
pre-release version in Budapest while we

00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:45,419
were all in Budapest for a hypothesis

00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:47,280
meeting and that's as far as I got

00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:48,780
because then everybody got busy again so

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,150
there wasn't any real governance that

00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:53,040
was outside of hypothesis for this

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,990
project there wasn't anybody to step up

00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,790
and say hey we want to use it or like

00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,620
want to continue its development but

00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,690
there were loads and loads of forks and

00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,540
loads and loads of people benefiting

00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:07,020
from it and enjoying it but no clear way

00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,470
to give back to it so covered a lot of

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,530
that

00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:13,620
oh but hypothesis also helped the

00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:15,600
creation of the open annotation working

00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,510
group and which eventually published a

00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,580
annotation model of itself or itself and

00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:22,860
then they also were instrumental in

00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,380
getting the w3c web annotation working

00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,510
group started join that hired me I

00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:31,460
worked on the specs and now we have

00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:31,460
those specs we'll look out later

00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:38,580
fractured it's also got mixed licenses

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:40,050
the annotate ojs code it's a hybrid it's

00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,000
a dual license thing

00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,950
jQuery did this a while ago I think

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,410
maybe they still do where it's GPL and

00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:49,290
MIT which is silly

00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:50,940
don't ever do that like the MIT is fully

00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,130
compatible with the GPL there's really

00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,650
no reason on earth that you would also

00:08:53,130 --> 00:09:00,300
GPL it that I know of legally or

00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:02,730
otherwise so it's licensed under both so

00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:06,960
basically that means strangely to me

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:09,500
that if you fork it you can pick or you

00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,910
can also do a license so what that means

00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,610
practically is that all the plugins pick

00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:17,100
the one that they sell fit their project

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,660
so half of the plugins where GPL then

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,510
half of the plugins were in my tea and

00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,760
if you're say IBM you're not going to

00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,020
touch half those plugins so you only get

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,880
half the community and you only get half

00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,770
the projects and you can only contribute

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,220
to half of it so this is weird like

00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:33,690
nobody knew where to look or how to be

00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,230
involved without running into something

00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:38,850
the other problem was that because of

00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:43,380
the dual licensing and all the four

00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:46,080
kings it wasn't clear who actually owned

00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,300
the original annotator code it was

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,470
funded by okay FN of the Knowledge

00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:55,200
Foundation or just open knowledge now

00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:58,500
but the copyright stated was mixed

00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,510
inning and eventually Aaron and then the

00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,770
contributors in which case you're going

00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,300
to do a license change you now have to

00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:06,900
go figure out who all those people are

00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:09,570
contact them make the change so it it's

00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:12,390
related to the reason patchy annotator

00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:14,190
doesn't have any code to start with we

00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,780
started with the community and we're

00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,980
birthday encode now that there are

00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,210
people in the room so it's a little

00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,830
backwards

00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:22,110
and that was part of the hold up was

00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,850
working through before we even did the

00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,500
proposal was working through is this

00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,360
possible at the ASF can you come here

00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,510
with just a community of community over

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,010
code that seems okay turns out it is but

00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:35,160
then obviously we need to ship releases

00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:38,120
for something so we started coding not

00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:41,610
just because we need a release so

00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:44,670
there's also no can no driving impetus

00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:46,320
to give back to that particular project

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,570
like we saw with hypothesis they

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,400
essentially were a big are a big fork of

00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,950
annotator and they had a governance

00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,410
model

00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,400
they had a reason to run it over here

00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,770
with their own governance

00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,710
whereas annotator j/s was this confused

00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:01,240
tangled thing that was not clearly

00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:03,610
governed and we've governed by people

00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,860
who worked for hypothesis so like why

00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:07,270
bother also doing it over here there was

00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,860
no real motivation to do that the

00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:11,760
mailing lists were active there's still

00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:15,400
several hundred people subscribed to it

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:20,170
but yet the BDF elves moved on and it's

00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:21,760
up there rotting right now so this was

00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:24,550
an attempt along the way to try and

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,470
bring balance to divorce which was the

00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,810
oak know there's supposed to be a photo

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:31,780
there anyway this picture of the open

00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:34,930
annotation dot org website which is not

00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:37,510
terribly pretty so it's okay Brooke the

00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:39,970
spec development happened essentially in

00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:43,330
line with annotator J s and was somewhat

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,860
influenced by its architecture some of

00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:49,180
the same people were involved in both

00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:51,010
things but mostly Nick and Randall a lot

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:56,140
of the specification stuff was happening

00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:59,680
or did happen by archivists and gallery

00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:02,380
people and scholarly education and stuff

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,320
like that so they didn't just solve the

00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:08,620
I want to highlight some text on medium

00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,820
and leave a comment like that's what

00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,100
most people on the web think of

00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,330
annotation is like what genius com did

00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,160
for a while currently now they're a

00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:19,750
video company as of two weeks ago I

00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:21,850
don't know weird to it so yeah most

00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:23,320
people think oh annotator is going to

00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,020
let me highlight stuff and comment on

00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,760
stuff and it's true it does do that but

00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:30,820
our objective is to also deal with the

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,600
scholarly educational scholarly and

00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:37,210
educational concerns such as

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,280
double-blind peer review and portable

00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:41,290
student annotations where you've

00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,770
annotated as a student and you're

00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:46,240
wanting to give them to your teacher to

00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:48,450
review and/or vet and/or give you a

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,820
grade on or your collaboratively

00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:54,160
annotating as a classroom and building

00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,390
up your collective thoughts on Hamlet

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,870
because you're going to discuss it the

00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:59,550
next week or your Vatican which is where

00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,620
this

00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,300
at another conference coming up and you

00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,300
have all these images that you've taken

00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:09,410
of all these giant things these art

00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:12,480
pieces and you want to be able to

00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:15,000
perhaps translate these texts that are

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,810
illuminated and there's another spec

00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,070
called it from the triple I F I can

00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:22,080
never remember what all the eyes stand

00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:24,720
for interoperable image something

00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,910
something I'll look it up too and if

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,790
anyone's really curious but that is a

00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:32,460
spec for highly scalable images such

00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:34,500
that you can have an image that is out

00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:38,250
say the Mona Lisa stored at its actual

00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,690
size and then you don't want to push

00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,930
that over the wire every time right so

00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:44,580
you get like a smaller version of it

00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:47,010
encoded and then you can just scroll and

00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:48,900
zoom in and it's only going to take your

00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:51,120
viewport and just give you that part of

00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,960
the image as you scroll in at different

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,130
scale so it's a way to deal with as

00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,080
gallery archivists and people like that

00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:00,450
want to be able to get all the way down

00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,970
to the paint strokes on the Mona Lisa

00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:04,410
digitally and zoom all the way back out

00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:07,500
again and be able to talk about each

00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:09,810
piece of that without having the like

00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,240
small no no Lisa and the medium-sized

00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,380
Mona Lisa and that they look like it

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,140
doesn't work that way that doesn't scale

00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,610
so it looks a lot like a mapping service

00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,200
at the end of the day like the

00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:22,140
experience you have with Google Maps not

00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,780
dissimilar in fact a API to look awfully

00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:26,640
similar but these people were also

00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:29,040
involved along with the skull comm

00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,740
people and education people so they

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,270
address like loads of problems that most

00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,730
people don't even know annotation can

00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:37,680
deal with or is related to and they

00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:39,900
tried to spec it in a way that could

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,600
also deal with things like talking about

00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:44,910
part of a brain scan in three dimensions

00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,310
like we don't want to just say like this

00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:52,050
part of his head is broken no it's like

00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:55,080
this part in like XYZ index and and to

00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:57,540
be able to deal with pointing at stuff

00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,520
that we don't know how to point out yet

00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,590
like there's not a there's not

00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,390
necessarily a way to talk about certain

00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:04,690
things yet

00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,829
so they tried to make it marginal

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,029
modular enough so you could target

00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:10,279
anything

00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:13,070
once those selectors is what we call

00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:14,510
them for the target were specified once

00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:17,060
there was a way to talk about that part

00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:18,829
of the brain then it can fit into the

00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:23,209
model right here so we'll look at that

00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:25,310
soon so that's the history kind of

00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:27,380
verbose but it is suitable for

00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:29,269
production it is in production this open

00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,240
annotation spec this is what widely uses

00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:34,130
we do this for our editorial process and

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,610
this is what I'm helping to move towards

00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:40,700
web annotation which was born out of

00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:42,890
this group at the w3c which was

00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:46,130
chartered out of the digital publishing

00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:49,160
interest group at the time I think it's

00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:51,589
in here yeah and the interest group that

00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,880
published use cases for annotation which

00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:55,250
covered some of the ones I just

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,170
mentioned a lot of them are related to

00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:00,170
the experience of online documents web

00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:02,600
pages but also the offline web Enosh

00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:05,209
sort of things like epubs and pdfs

00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:08,390
that we distribute online but aren't

00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:11,120
themselves HTML so we needed a model

00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:13,190
that could talk about stuff irrespective

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,130
of the media type that you got so you

00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,510
could have Tim berners-lee's information

00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:19,279
management of proposal which is the

00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,230
document he wrote at CERN that said I

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,940
want to build this web thing before he

00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,850
even called it that right it's like

00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:28,579
seven made pages you can find it as a

00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:31,010
PDF on georgy university site you can

00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:33,910
find it as an HTML file on his site and

00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:38,329
then how do you how do if I quote that

00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:40,519
which I do often how do I reenter that

00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:42,800
on all those editions all those

00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:45,470
printings of that thing on the web or

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,630
off the web if I downloaded that HTML

00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:50,630
page or have that PDF say on a Kindle or

00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:52,370
some other reader how does it know well

00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:54,260
you've got this annotation where do I

00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:56,660
put it how do I show it on that does it

00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:59,540
even point at this same thing is this a

00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,269
version of that thing so it was a lot of

00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:05,569
exploration around identification

00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:07,250
targeting selecting specifying good good

00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:08,559
good fun I don't know if any of you have

00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,689
done specs before but

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:14,049
I highly recommend it if you're at all

00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:18,429
wonky in this regard or if you like just

00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:21,549
tech history which is a hobby of mine so

00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:23,949
the open annotation community group had

00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:25,749
been around kind of at the same time

00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:28,029
this use case document came out or a

00:17:25,749 --> 00:17:29,499
little bit before they even built this

00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:30,789
use case document because a lot of the

00:17:29,499 --> 00:17:32,620
same people were in the digital

00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:35,710
publishing interest group and then there

00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:38,049
was enough sort of sort of mass forming

00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,519
with hypothesis and the groups that they

00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:42,879
said well let's give it its own

00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:44,919
top-level sort of project at the w3c so

00:17:42,879 --> 00:17:48,460
w3 dot org slash annotation will tell

00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:50,529
you all these things and so they took

00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,600
the community group which anyone can be

00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:55,240
involved in and then moved it into like

00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,490
the intellectual property safe zone of

00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,649
the w3c membership where it was then

00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:03,039
kind of hardened and fleshed out as the

00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:04,570
web annotation data model and during the

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:07,929
charter of this group which was like two

00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:09,639
and a half years I guess yeah so it

00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:12,999
built on the open annotation spec and

00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:15,129
burst the web annotation spec I'm saying

00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:17,649
that a billion times because it still

00:18:15,129 --> 00:18:22,139
confuses people web annotation is the

00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:24,820
new one so yeah let's see what's next

00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:26,200
yeah Apache annotator why I'm talking

00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:30,610
about all of this right now

00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:32,559
and not at a w3c event the community

00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,899
needed these things most of which I've

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,029
mentioned before they needed a shared

00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:39,519
space to collaborate because it still is

00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:42,850
not clear where to do that we're working

00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:45,279
on that people say I want to add and

00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:46,960
this is the most common cave I want to

00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,690
add highlighting and commenting to my

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,249
web page or my online Doc's or whatever

00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:53,259
right I'm an open source project I

00:18:51,249 --> 00:18:55,600
publish this great documentation there'd

00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:57,580
be typos I want people who tell me

00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,179
they're typos I want people to help each

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:02,950
other you know in the sidebar maybe or

00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:07,749
have a conversation or some kinds of

00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:09,279
reasons so people find annotate ojs and

00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:11,470
think oh it's great i download it and i

00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:12,730
put it on my website and it works then I

00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,259
want to change it so I'll go to the

00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:15,820
mailing list and while no post since

00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:18,280
like 2015 and

00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:20,260
you know commit since 2015 and already

00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,060
but ago although they went to hypothesis

00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,760
well I'll reuse hypothesis but

00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:27,760
hypothesis is either public service run

00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,350
by a non-profit and it's this MIT

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,940
license massive thing that uses

00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,740
elasticsearch and I've got to run like

00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,720
all kinds of stuff to get the thing up

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,870
and running so that's not what they want

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,360
and this other smaller thing looks dead

00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:42,640
so where do they go so we wanted to give

00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,420
a place where all those people the

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,550
hypothesis

00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:49,240
perhaps the genius how they continue to

00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:51,490
do annotation the libraries that have

00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,110
annotation tools the other publishing

00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,300
services like medium and places like

00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:57,670
that that have annotation tools to come

00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:01,300
and like share their problems and fix

00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:03,400
the wider code issues with annotating on

00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,320
the web first and then annotating

00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,960
elsewhere - and like mobile apps and

00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,910
things like that and we needed it to be

00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,950
a place where the ownership was shared

00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:14,080
so that when the BDF elves wandered off

00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:16,150
to do other things there got hired the

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,980
thing could persist and the project

00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:20,350
would live on which you may have heard

00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:23,260
if you've been another Apache Way talks

00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:24,400
it's super important we wanted there to

00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,470
be a shared objectives

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,790
everybody does it idiots and chronically

00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:29,890
but if you do it as a Venn diagram

00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:32,080
there's a big chunk that we can all

00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,400
share there's a data model that's

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,920
specified there's a protocol that's

00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,330
specified there's some code around this

00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,940
but we want to put it in a safe place

00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:41,740
like the Apache foundation where it will

00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:45,430
get maintained as long as somebody wants

00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:47,470
to maintain it and we can share making

00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:49,360
that happen in that circle of that Venn

00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:52,120
diagram and then on top of that people

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,740
can be different right they can do you

00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,150
know in this case it's really important

00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,670
that this person be able to do different

00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:59,410
color highlighting like one person gets

00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,850
ten different colors because they're

00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:02,050
going to use red for the people and

00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,820
they're going to use blue for the places

00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:05,200
in which case now they're starting to do

00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,360
stuff that looks like natural language

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,130
processing but what is the robot did the

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,990
annotations and then the person is just

00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:13,930
plus wanting them that already happens

00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:16,300
at Apache um ah which uses open

00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:17,500
annotation data model stuff already but

00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:20,560
they don't necessarily have a way to

00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,090
display it on the webpage so if we build

00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,330
these tools we can take you in my I'll

00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:26,880
put show it on a web page and

00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:29,220
build interfaces idiosyncratic ones that

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,890
give you a plus one minus one on each

00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,750
one of those NLP findings till you say

00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:36,570
yeah that's that's Brooklyn the person

00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:38,039
not Brooklyn the place or vice versa

00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:40,740
so there's all kinds of tools it can be

00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:42,809
built on this and we don't plan to build

00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,909
all the interfaces we plan to just build

00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:46,500
the tooling that can provide that and

00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:48,690
we'll have some demos that are

00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,700
interfaces but we're not doing the

00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,809
kitchen sinky thing again because that

00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,429
didn't work

00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:59,120
annotator jeaious had a file called

00:21:53,429 --> 00:22:02,460
kitchen sink GIS so oh yeah it's right

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:07,110
so all that history and all that

00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:08,870
background has landed us with being the

00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:12,059
place that people are beginning to look

00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:13,980
to come and collaborate so Randall Leeds

00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:16,740
mentioned early early on in this talk

00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,960
and myself or apache couchdb committers

00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:21,360
so we knew our way around apache it had

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,510
all the enterprise-e SafeZone things

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,519
that a community would need and it was a

00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,889
place that we could start fresh using

00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:31,500
his libraries because he eventually out

00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:33,389
of the annotator JS project rewrote

00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,940
anchoring libraries and anchoring is the

00:22:33,389 --> 00:22:37,559
bit that like takes those selectors and

00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,720
finds it in the dom and either gives you

00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:42,059
a highlight or so they can't find it or

00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,980
turns it into an actual selection like

00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:45,899
you would do with their mouse or the

00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,789
ability to flip that were given a

00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:50,190
selection that you just made I want to

00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:52,169
turn it into a selector he had small

00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:54,720
libraries like that but they're just in

00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:55,769
his get out and if you got hit with a

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,929
bus they'd be over

00:22:55,769 --> 00:23:01,500
so we're gradually moving those things

00:22:57,929 --> 00:23:03,570
in as well so let's take a look at what

00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,279
a web annotation document actually looks

00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:07,520
like you can get a sense for what we're

00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:11,870
going to build

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:15,080
so interstitial was a fabulous word that

00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:16,610
more people should use marketers use it

00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,380
occasionally when they talk about

00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:20,330
landing pages that are in between things

00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:23,210
basically interstitial refers to

00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:25,429
anything that's like combinatory which

00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:30,530
is another great word and that does that

00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:32,510
cleared up so like ligaments and things

00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:34,520
like that are interstitial it's the

00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:36,080
space in between and usually the filling

00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:39,020
of a space in between to combine two

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:43,220
other things so annotations always sit

00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:45,559
between most of the target and a body

00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:48,050
which could be in this case the two

00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:50,570
totally separate things right we've got

00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:52,670
this page and then you've got a blog

00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:55,970
post that's talking about that page and

00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:57,830
it in turn is an annotation so in the

00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:59,929
data model there's no there's no

00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:02,900
assumption that you're actually going to

00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:04,970
encode the body of the annotation which

00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:08,929
would be the comment or the tags or the

00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:11,900
+1 or whatever there's no mandate that

00:24:08,929 --> 00:24:14,059
it be in the actual annotation document

00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,340
which means I can have an image annotate

00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:18,500
an image or I can have a video talk

00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:20,740
about an image or I can have a human

00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:23,780
being not accessible on the web

00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:25,420
annotated by a photo and things like

00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,770
that it made it possible to talk about

00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:30,380
Mona Lisa paint textures with a

00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:34,690
Wikipedia page which there weren't

00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:38,270
existing models for this so much so

00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:42,200
intersted - awesome so crew case here's

00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:45,650
an annotation done with audio in the

00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:48,530
body the ID points to the resource

00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:51,380
itself on the web and then there's some

00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:54,200
helpers basically for the interface to

00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:56,000
say this is in this media format so be

00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,290
ready to play it or if you can't play it

00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,059
just ignore it if you don't know how to

00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:01,610
put this out or just link to it as a

00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:04,190
fallback and it's in French so if your

00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:07,970
readers in English let them know they're

00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:09,860
going to hear French upfront or Chinese

00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:11,100
or whatever and then it's still

00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:13,080
targeting that page

00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:17,460
so in this case this is the audio

00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:19,830
version of that post we saw earlier in

00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:22,470
the top-level ID here I'll come back to

00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:24,690
the context document in a minute but the

00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:27,870
ID here is for the annotation itself so

00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:29,970
you can also have annotations reference

00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,500
other annotations in a replying sort of

00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:34,049
fashion where I can annotate your

00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:37,880
annotation many annotations all the way

00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:42,740
down you take that too far really easily

00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:45,929
and I have so in this case the body is a

00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:47,669
maybe an HTML document again and it's

00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:49,409
targeting a very specific part of an

00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:50,850
image this is not using the triple is

00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:53,759
awesome as I was talking about earlier

00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:55,919
this is using a thing called media

00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:59,429
fragments which is a fragment identifier

00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:02,850
that can apply to images there's also

00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:06,419
one for videos so this is the X Y width

00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:09,389
and height of square positioned at this

00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:11,850
X Y on this two-dimensional jpg

00:26:09,389 --> 00:26:14,100
apparently and so these things serve as

00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:16,169
hints again to say if your an annotation

00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,480
tool it's looking for images this is an

00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:22,590
image and so you can expect that there's

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,149
media fragment identifiers and this is

00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,169
that part specifically that I'm talking

00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:27,330
about I'm not talking about the whole

00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:29,190
image I'm talking to all the Mona Lisa

00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:32,129
I'm talking about her smile and this

00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:34,049
blog post or Wikipedia page is about

00:26:32,129 --> 00:26:37,340
Mona Lisa smile and so I'm targeting

00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:40,250
just the smile is kind of the idea

00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:44,789
the Mona Lisa is super small by the way

00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:48,509
yeah then the starry night is like pinky

00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:49,830
it's like 12 inches by something and you

00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:51,929
ever see them in person they don't look

00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:54,120
as great as sometimes as they do in the

00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:56,039
book which is weird Monet's waters

00:26:54,120 --> 00:27:00,840
always though like to get drowned in

00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:02,460
this thing sorry CSS selectors you use

00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,740
these all the time if you do any kind of

00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,790
web development so we've exposed them

00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,800
here as a way that you can encode them

00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:11,580
they're not includable as a fragment

00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:14,590
selector you can't put it in the URL of

00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:18,760
anything I mean you can you can but it

00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:21,220
doesn't work so in this case this is us

00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:23,740
what we call a specific resource the

00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:26,260
target doesn't have an ID now the target

00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:28,030
has a source and the source is this page

00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,830
so it's sort of like saying the Mona

00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:32,650
Lisa thing but then like I'm focused

00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:35,070
only on her smile in this case I've got

00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:37,990
this HTML page and I'm only focused on

00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:40,960
this ID this specific paragraph within

00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:43,960
this space and this is a great selector

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:47,250
if you support CSS in the rendering

00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:50,710
engine which you know Acrobat does not

00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:55,110
so we need more selectors so here's

00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:58,000
another one which presumes a

00:27:55,110 --> 00:28:01,320
hierarchical markup language but it

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,030
works really great if you have expat and

00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:06,640
we have options for combining these so

00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:09,760
if you are in a browser your browser

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,400
supports both CSS and XPath and the

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,330
developer implementing the reading or

00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:18,760
the experience of viewing the annotation

00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:20,740
can use both to make sure that it's in

00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,930
the right place can use either of them

00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:27,430
for optimization purposes XPath tends to

00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:29,610
be faster not always so there are

00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:32,830
reasons to record more than one and

00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:37,240
here's a nice generic one I don't know

00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:38,980
Rebeca body now yeah we'll give back to

00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,920
selectors there are ways to talk about

00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:44,170
just the text as a text quote selector

00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,660
and those are the most generic but then

00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:50,770
there's other issues with those so this

00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:52,510
is an inline textual body you know

00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:55,720
that's 90% of the comments on the web

00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:58,090
right the nice ones and that's talking

00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,410
about a photo so in this case our format

00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:02,920
stuff and the language are talking about

00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:05,980
the body itself it's in English and it's

00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:08,170
an HTML annotation by default their text

00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:09,880
plane if that's a textual body with a

00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:13,510
value the assumption is it's

00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:14,770
just plain text text slash blank so

00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:18,220
there should be no markup in it but I

00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:21,330
could make markdown format annotations

00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:23,500
that I could ship around as well and

00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:26,890
there are ways to provide multiple

00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:30,610
bodies so if you are doing a tagging

00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:32,560
system and also providing the ability to

00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:36,580
have a comment then each one of those

00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:39,790
are standalone bodies that halt all our

00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:41,560
annotations of this target down here or

00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:44,140
these targets actually there's more than

00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:46,480
one so in this case I'm talking about

00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:49,450
the Wikipedia page about cats and this

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,870
particular photo together and these

00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:54,750
things the both these annotations apply

00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:58,240
independently to both of those targets

00:29:54,750 --> 00:30:01,090
is the current meaning so they both get

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:04,390
the cat tag and they both get cats are

00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:06,340
furry which is super helpful and we have

00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:08,050
these purposes which also have a thing

00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:11,440
on top called motivation those are

00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:13,630
essentially the same thing and those are

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,060
additional hints to the rendering agent

00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:17,320
for knowing that you're doing editorial

00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:19,300
with this annotation or that was your

00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:22,690
intent right you showed up with this

00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:24,730
annotation and cat is still just a

00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:26,410
textual body like the one right below it

00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:28,480
these are the same types of things

00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:30,730
they're both text plain but this one

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,860
here is tagging and this one here is

00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:35,770
describing so if I only care about the

00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:38,800
tags I can just look for stuff that had

00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:41,410
bodies that have the purpose of tagging

00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,240
and if I'm doing editorial I can ignore

00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:48,820
the things that are classifying or

00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:53,290
whatever here's one that has been passed

00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:56,730
around a bit we introduced canonical and

00:30:53,290 --> 00:31:00,130
via via is actually from atom pub and

00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:02,710
atom feeds have this via thing where in

00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:05,260
an atom feed you can you can inline a

00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:08,500
post or a part of the post and it has an

00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:11,200
atom via URL that says I'm not the whole

00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:13,480
post this XML you disguise with the that

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,730
has like markup in it I'm not supposed

00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,800
to close over here I came into the speed

00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:20,050
via this other bigger thing I'm probably

00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,929
not even the whole thing so we use that

00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:24,029
sort of like history chaining

00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:26,340
to be able to do offline first

00:31:24,029 --> 00:31:29,639
annotation so in this case this is a

00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:32,490
version for UUID that presumably was the

00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:35,340
original identifier of this annotation

00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:39,230
made in my browser and I have since

00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:41,759
published it to example.org anno 20 and

00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:43,649
the original identifier got moved to the

00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:46,169
canonical one so if I published it to

00:31:43,649 --> 00:31:48,720
ten places canonical should all be this

00:31:46,169 --> 00:31:50,100
identifier so you can find them all

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,159
again and do some deduplication

00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,389
but the IDS could be retrieval points

00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:56,249
for any of these so there might be a

00:31:54,389 --> 00:31:58,200
Twitter annotation idea there might be a

00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:59,549
Facebook annotation ID but they should

00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,950
all persist while they have to if

00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:04,919
they're doing the protocol persist that

00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:06,749
canonical identifier so that when I get

00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:08,759
them back or you get my annotations in

00:32:06,749 --> 00:32:10,559
some way you can deduct them even if

00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:15,299
they come across loads of different

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:17,159
spaces the vo1 is also the service that

00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:18,809
perhaps this is relayed through so it

00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:20,759
may have come through an atom feed type

00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:23,340
service so you actually got it from

00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:27,600
another hop so it also had this other

00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:29,879
idea other location at one point perhaps

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,279
I sent it through Mastodon and then that

00:32:29,879 --> 00:32:34,350
persisted it out to Twitter and whatever

00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:35,999
so now it's got this via chain that can

00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:38,159
be an array and they're just other

00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:39,929
identifiers known about this thing so it

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,779
depends on how you want to architect it

00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:44,820
but what this allows you to do is move

00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:48,389
annotations through lots of services and

00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:50,190
sort of like aggregate all those IDs as

00:32:48,389 --> 00:32:51,899
the thing moves along so that if you

00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:53,850
encounter any of its versions you know

00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:58,159
ok we're all connected we're all the

00:32:53,850 --> 00:33:01,379
same ID or all the same annotation and

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,269
here there's a review body and in this

00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:05,279
case I've defined the rights of the body

00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:07,379
it's not the rights of the annotation

00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,909
it's not the rights of the target it's

00:33:07,379 --> 00:33:11,960
just the rights of the body so I can use

00:33:08,909 --> 00:33:14,909
rights on the whole annotation which

00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,860
debatably copyrightable I think most

00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:20,490
people say it's not for just a full

00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:23,100
Jason chunk but I certainly can express

00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:26,009
the rights of the body I can put that on

00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:27,869
target but that implies an ownership of

00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:29,669
the target that may not be there but I

00:33:27,869 --> 00:33:31,320
can still hint to the tool I'm talking

00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:34,320
about copyrighted material

00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:36,600
or not copyrighted material but really

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,370
legally you should go check and make

00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:43,110
sure that the target is actually

00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:47,910
licensed that way so let's take a deeper

00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:51,000
dive into the protocol the biggest thing

00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:54,540
that protocol adds is a container system

00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,330
or a collection system it's based on

00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:58,350
link data platform which is from IBM and

00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:02,490
itself

00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:05,730
LDP to its friends is based on atom pub

00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:09,450
so hence we were reading those document

00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:12,060
scripts stuff from and it is a simple

00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:15,570
get post put and delete way of storing

00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:18,060
anything in containers and then there's

00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:21,300
more advanced stuff that LDP does but we

00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:24,750
just needed the basic container bit so

00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:28,280
we define this discovery mechanism that

00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:31,710
says the protocol lives here that

00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:34,920
wrapped poorly these links should be on

00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:36,750
separate lines so it's a basic container

00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:39,120
so if you have an L VP client it can

00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:42,000
read these but then it mentions this

00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:44,730
constrained by relationship that says if

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,100
you do annotations on specifically an

00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:48,630
annotation container so if you can do

00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:52,710
more awesome stuff with the stuff you

00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:55,950
find in here please do etags for good

00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:58,740
caching and then the rest is pretty

00:34:55,950 --> 00:35:01,620
standard stuff the media type down here

00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:03,810
in the accept post header is saying that

00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:06,900
you can write to it if you know web

00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:08,880
annotation document types you can send

00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:11,000
that and you can send it in JSON or you

00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:15,300
can send it in turtle if you prefer

00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,510
which is a rdf based triple expression

00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,210
thing

00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:22,780
so annotation containers look like this

00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:25,780
which are yet more json-ld how many of

00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,980
you know what Jason lb is okay its first

00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,750
time I mentioned it but we've been

00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,700
looking at it this whole time it looks

00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:33,190
just like Jason except it has this

00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:36,850
little at context hanging in the top and

00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:39,609
what that allows you to do is make all

00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:42,300
those other wise English strings that

00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:47,800
means zero to your software initially

00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:50,020
and mean zero and Mandarin you can give

00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:52,240
them identify errs on the web from which

00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:54,369
you can potentially look up

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:57,210
documentation look up meaning in other

00:35:54,369 --> 00:36:00,760
languages look up all kinds of stuff

00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:02,880
that's all gravy the biggest thing it

00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,720
actually does is make all of those

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,590
longer URIs

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,720
that have some ownership and persistence

00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:13,000
such that everyone can use those

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,520
identifiers and not have collision

00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,560
around things like type and ID which

00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,650
most of us used and all the api's we've

00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:22,119
ever built you can find out the meaning

00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:24,160
of total but you can also be sure that

00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:26,230
you're talking about the total number of

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,380
annotations in an annotation container

00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:33,070
in this context so it's a really

00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:35,710
fascinating way to extend Jason to be

00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:38,410
moved around the web in very webby

00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:39,940
fashions with minimal collision and the

00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:43,450
ability to transform it into different

00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:44,980
Jason shapes and stored in all kinds of

00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:51,060
things like triple stores and graph

00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:54,670
databases or CouchDB or whatever so that

00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:55,930
is the sum total of a container there

00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:58,960
are other representations we'll take a

00:36:55,930 --> 00:37:00,520
look at but this is sort of the atom

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,970
service document if you're familiar with

00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:06,310
atom atom pub and it just says like I'm

00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:08,590
here I'm an annotation container the

00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:10,180
first page is here potentially the last

00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,630
page is here if you wanted to figure

00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:13,869
that out

00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:16,000
as the service provider and I'm a basic

00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:18,410
LVP container and an annotation

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,840
collection specifically

00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:25,380
so another option is to inline the first

00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:27,480
page so for optimization you a lot of

00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:29,310
times don't want to get the like oh yeah

00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,630
okay you're a collection super now I got

00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:33,030
to go get the first stage of annotations

00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:34,530
you want to do that in one thing you can

00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:37,590
send this preference with your get

00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:40,470
request that says I prefer the full

00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:42,450
representation so give me basically the

00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:44,490
container and the first page because I'm

00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:47,490
going to just render those things right

00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:50,100
off and I'll deal with pagination later

00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:55,020
so this is the first page the next page

00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:57,360
is linked to here and that it has an ID

00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:01,740
for retrieval later this thing is opaque

00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:03,210
there's no definition in web annotation

00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,740
how any of your urls should be

00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:06,990
structured so if that doesn't look like

00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,790
the way you like to paginate things no

00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:11,130
worries

00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:13,230
it's a hyper media api so if you say

00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:16,530
next and you give it a string we assume

00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:18,660
it's in a URL that can say start key

00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:21,960
equals whatever if you're using caps TV

00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:24,960
and in key equals something else and in

00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:28,640
this case the items are contained IR I

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,600
prefer contained IRI the top IRI is

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:34,590
internationalized resource identifier

00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:37,410
it's like a URI which can be in Chinese

00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:38,730
and whatever else and so in this case

00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:40,530
it's just the identifier of the

00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:42,210
annotation so we streamlined it a bit

00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:43,410
we're getting the collection and we're

00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:45,140
getting the first page but we're not

00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:47,060
getting the annotations those

00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:49,770
potentially are being gotten

00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:51,720
asynchronously and then populated in the

00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:53,400
interface or the database or whatever

00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:57,960
you're doing but you can also include

00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:59,880
the whole thing I think I didn't change

00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:03,350
that supposed to you

00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:06,360
can can I don't remember what it is help

00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:08,550
prefer contain descriptions I just

00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:12,030
didn't update the URL so this is a way

00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:14,580
to include the entire annotation out of

00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:16,740
the protocol such that you can get the

00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:18,750
collection the first page and all the

00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:22,590
annotations in the first page and then

00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:23,940
just get to work highlighting to each

00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:28,760
stream lights you make fewer get

00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:30,870
requests basically here is another one

00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,410
which I think we've essentially already

00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:33,150
looked at

00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:37,080
yeah the minimal container is the one we

00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:39,540
solve first and it's the default you

00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:41,190
know cool so there are lots of ways to

00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:44,400
get involved in this project if I

00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:46,620
haven't just bored you sniffed the open

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,840
annotation community group is back up

00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:50,880
and running and if you've never been

00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:53,550
involved in the w3c the community groups

00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:56,100
are the free and open way to do that you

00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:58,530
don't have to pay a membership fee you

00:39:56,100 --> 00:40:01,350
get to actually a WordPress run site you

00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:03,030
just go click join you make an account

00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:04,740
you say I'm not affiliated with any

00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:05,910
member if you're not if you are then

00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:08,340
you've got to probably talk to somebody

00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:10,980
at your company but if you're not you

00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:12,570
can pop right in and you can read the

00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:16,800
reports and you can join the mailing

00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:18,900
list and do all kinds of stuff and we're

00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,640
continuing to discuss there whether or

00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:24,810
not we're going to do an annotation 2.0

00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:27,120
and if so what that sort of thing and of

00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:28,740
course you're here to patchak on so you

00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:32,310
can get involved in the incubating

00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:35,130
Apache project the code is just booting

00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:37,470
out but we have a really solid framework

00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:40,740
for developing so we've got all the

00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:45,620
build kit in place we're doing purely at

00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:50,190
6 models Solway crazy crazy hype cycle

00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:54,030
content but it's cool es6 developed

00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:56,220
modules that you hot reload in Chrome or

00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:58,680
Firefox you can have your console open

00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:01,470
and edit the stuff off your hard drive

00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:03,570
and as you say that there it's hot rate

00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:05,640
a page on the left or top or wherever

00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:07,140
you got it positioned because the debt

00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,930
server is watching all that and auto

00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:12,390
bundling and any way out of it is a mono

00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:17,130
repo so out of that mono repo we can

00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:18,840
package idiosyncratic combinations so if

00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:20,160
you don't even have to use all of what

00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:23,130
we're going to put in annotator you can

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:26,730
say I'm only doing SX pass selectors and

00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:28,470
I want your Dom highlighter and I don't

00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:30,180
need CSS and I don't need whatever

00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:32,160
give me a bundle it's just that and

00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:34,380
we'll also have the opportunity or

00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:37,410
option to distribute each one of those

00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:40,170
as NPM modules and then we'll also be

00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:42,570
doing a protocol server that code exists

00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:43,970
we just have to go through the donation

00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:52,609
process

00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:52,609
so thanks any questions yeah

00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:07,630
right yes that is covered and cover it

00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:11,019
specifically but the model provides for

00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:13,510
its art for the screen flashing in this

00:42:11,019 --> 00:42:15,700
in the fact that targets can be multiple

00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:18,970
things as well as bodies there are ways

00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:20,470
to say I'm a list of targets or to

00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:23,589
provide the meaning that you want to

00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:28,269
attempt a series of within a target you

00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:29,890
have selectors which we saw back here so

00:42:28,269 --> 00:42:31,660
you can have multiple selectors as well

00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:35,140
which is one of the flexibilities the

00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:37,510
json-ld model dots so you could define

00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:39,309
the exFAT selector which is most likely

00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:40,809
to break right like if you move that

00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:43,390
paragraph you're not talking about same

00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:45,519
paragraph anymore so you would combine

00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:50,559
with this a text quote selector

00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:52,799
potentially a broader CSS selector or

00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:55,510
something with a specific ID perhaps

00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:59,200
such that you can use those strategies

00:42:55,510 --> 00:43:01,299
to say I as the implementer and this is

00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,640
where the videos can kradic again all of

00:43:01,299 --> 00:43:07,390
these have to anchor to the same dom

00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:09,069
range thing or it didn't apply like

00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:10,900
because it's an editorial thing right

00:43:09,069 --> 00:43:13,059
you like to fix this type of right here

00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:16,180
not through the whole document just this

00:43:13,059 --> 00:43:17,829
one so if they made that change in the

00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,660
next version you don't want that

00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:22,269
annotation to ever anchor again because

00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:24,670
you fix the problem but then if it's

00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:27,460
changing on like New York Times

00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:29,109
redesigns their website you still want

00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:31,119
all your annotations to anchor on all

00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:32,619
the past articles in which case you're

00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,900
going to use something more generic like

00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:36,819
text quote selector such that if they

00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:39,279
move that quotation around in the page

00:43:36,819 --> 00:43:42,430
or you know mess up the Dom with all

00:43:39,279 --> 00:43:44,859
kinds of new webby stuff that's okay you

00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:46,660
still find the text in there or you know

00:43:44,859 --> 00:43:48,279
the terrible thing where they're not

00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:51,279
even providing the text in the page they

00:43:48,279 --> 00:43:53,589
inject it later with JavaScript and you

00:43:51,279 --> 00:43:55,650
don't have a stable Dom so you use text

00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:58,569
quotes selector or something like that

00:43:55,650 --> 00:44:00,759
researching all the cases for how to

00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:02,339
deal with change is something hypotheses

00:44:00,759 --> 00:44:06,449
has done a lot of

00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:08,999
and they've said they would be donating

00:44:06,449 --> 00:44:10,890
some of this anchoring code some of

00:44:08,999 --> 00:44:13,380
Randall's libraries his text quote

00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:17,279
selector one already does advanced

00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:18,509
dispatch patch finding so we actually

00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:21,449
have a bug in that because it doesn't

00:44:18,509 --> 00:44:22,949
conform to the spec text quote selectors

00:44:21,449 --> 00:44:25,140
should find you the first version and

00:44:22,949 --> 00:44:27,479
kids is already set up for fuzzy

00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:29,819
matching so it actually drops in the

00:44:27,479 --> 00:44:32,069
middle into the binary search to find

00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:33,900
the nearest match for you and really

00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:36,599
that's a developer preference whether or

00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:39,390
not in your scenario you want text code

00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:41,939
selector to be to the spec and I'm all

00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:44,369
we want the first one or I know within

00:44:41,939 --> 00:44:46,529
this space that just give me the dang

00:44:44,369 --> 00:44:48,059
highlight I don't care if it moved I

00:44:46,529 --> 00:44:51,479
need to find out whether or not this

00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:54,059
text is still here or I made my own

00:44:51,479 --> 00:44:55,949
little notes on this Wikipedia page that

00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:59,339
I've come back to maybe five years later

00:44:55,949 --> 00:45:01,140
and I want to know that it still anchors

00:44:59,339 --> 00:45:03,779
or I want to see it it does and know

00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:05,609
that it's worth and if not and has

00:45:03,779 --> 00:45:07,199
something to do with it like what was I

00:45:05,609 --> 00:45:10,019
talking about what was the quote again

00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:12,209
and you can inline your quotations as

00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:14,369
well which is one of the advantages of

00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:16,170
always storing the text quote selector

00:45:14,369 --> 00:45:19,319
which is the Cham I don't have an

00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:21,679
example of that you you store the exact

00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:24,689
highlight and then a prefix and a suffix

00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:26,549
such that you can know like in a

00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:31,439
villanelle that you're talking about

00:45:26,549 --> 00:45:33,660
line 5 and not line 6 7 or 8 yeah and

00:45:31,439 --> 00:45:38,339
there's also data position and text

00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:42,089
position there's a raft of about 6 no 10

00:45:38,339 --> 00:45:44,130
that we defined and then it can you can

00:45:42,089 --> 00:45:48,119
plug in anything like the media fragment

00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:49,559
identifier you can plug in any known URL

00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:51,929
fragment identifier

00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:55,319
you can also spec out your own type

00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:57,280
whatever and there's a range selector

00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:59,840
that hypothesis is done

00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,570
that actually made it into the spec

00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:04,220
during the prospects but that's what the

00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:06,110
community groups sport is to say like

00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:08,240
none of these selectors work for me I

00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:10,130
have this new way to do it or or on

00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,270
doing it on a media-type you had didn't

00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:13,640
even know about because it's a brain

00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:16,760
image or whatever and there's also a way

00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:19,490
to refine the selectors to say like I've

00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:21,920
I want this chunk that is the content of

00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:25,220
the page right now and I want to refine

00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:27,470
it down to a specific thing later anyway

00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:29,300
so selecting bits the hard part but

00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:31,460
that's also the Venn diagram part that

00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:34,310
all annotation projects want to see Saul

00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:36,920
so we plan to have testing

00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:38,570
infrastructure for that to look at in

00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,730
these scenarios this should do these

00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:44,870
things and give developers of tools to

00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:47,540
say this has to anchor you know like try

00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:50,090
this if it returns false then it's a

00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:52,220
success in the editorial case but if it

00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:54,200
returns true in my life I want to see my

00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:56,690
highlights again case then in that case

00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:59,900
that's what they want so but it's up to

00:46:56,690 --> 00:47:02,290
the developer long answer any last

00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,290
questions

00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:11,930
so yes it is not in our repo yet but I

00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:14,270
will give you a demo of what's going

00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:16,790
into the repo because Randall didn't

00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:22,190
quite get it committed we are also

00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:27,890
putting it up sorry

00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:30,290
just keyboard is buggy and we are also

00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:33,369
doing

00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:33,369
[Music]

00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:42,060
what's it called

00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:51,300
and we're in there I'm also a gamer and

00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:56,829
as you can see from my humble bundle and

00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:59,079
bundle down and barter VG crap I don't

00:47:56,829 --> 00:48:05,880
have the link handy Oh know where I can

00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:09,970
find it at the annotator wiki yeah no

00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:12,339
good Gris sorry anyway find me later

00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:14,260
I'll show you but what the demo does is

00:48:12,339 --> 00:48:17,410
you can select the text and it will show

00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:19,109
you the web annotation like as you

00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:21,520
change the selection you can see the

00:48:19,109 --> 00:48:23,410
annotation JSON document change shape

00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:26,500
with your selectors multiple ones and

00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:29,500
then in a recent firefox the crazy thing

00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:32,470
is that you can make your highlight

00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:34,990
control-c and it puts the annotation

00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:36,130
document in your clipboard so that if

00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:38,440
you paste it into a thing that

00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:40,180
understands annotation documents it will

00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:42,190
reenter it which of course that page

00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:43,540
understands those so you make your

00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:45,940
highlight you copy it you click off

00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:48,220
someplace and then you just control V on

00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:50,890
the page and it redoes the highlight so

00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:54,309
we're also exploring like what is the

00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:57,309
annotation experience like across

00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:58,569
different surfaces that our expectation

00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,020
is not to say in the browser all the

00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:01,869
time

00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:03,280
that's just our initial surface so the

00:49:01,869 --> 00:49:06,670
hope is to also be able to make it

00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,260
possible and the specs allows it to pass

00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:10,660
annotations around over email

00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:12,549
so I email you my annotations because

00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:14,230
there's maybe no place I want to publish

00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:15,670
them because maybe they're inflammatory

00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:17,829
or maybe they're not inflammatory maybe

00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:19,180
we're both trying to hide so I send them

00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:21,190
through encrypted email but you can

00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:22,599
still anchor them on the webpage because

00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:25,299
now they're your annotations by

00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:27,750
something too so there are reasons to

00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:30,670
allow for all these different systems of

00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:33,490
moving things but the anchoring that

00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:34,910
it's hard for clunkers that's what you

00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:41,990
used

00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:44,360
punker help anyway there's one more

00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:48,010
question which I'll answer quickly that

00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:48,010
you had if you still have it

00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:09,079
yet so there are specs for pointing to

00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:11,479
well two things the web annotation spec

00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:13,549
does not do that but we have the

00:50:11,479 --> 00:50:15,920
targeting system built in such a way

00:50:13,549 --> 00:50:18,410
that if those things are knowable of

00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,989
your resource then yes you can do that

00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:23,029
and we're working with the Anna myself

00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:25,670
and Randall are working with the

00:50:23,029 --> 00:50:27,979
Wikimedia Foundation to sort out how

00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:30,890
they do versions and they do it well in

00:50:27,979 --> 00:50:32,900
that they have URLs for every single

00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:34,910
version and you can just hit those URLs

00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:37,220
and get the past versions so then we're

00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:39,769
helping them express those in a way that

00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:42,289
the annotation tool can discover that

00:50:39,769 --> 00:50:46,039
the one I'm on has a previous version by

00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:47,930
using length data to say you know I'm

00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:50,210
the working copy or I'm the published

00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:51,950
copy and this is where my history lives

00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:55,279
and then from there they're in this

00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:58,309
order and so there's great reason to say

00:50:55,279 --> 00:51:01,099
to write an annotation that says this

00:50:58,309 --> 00:51:03,979
version and this version are wrong in

00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:05,420
this history of twelve things and that

00:51:03,979 --> 00:51:07,940
annotation actually talks about both

00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:10,369
versions and says there's there's false

00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:12,650
data in these we should find out who did

00:51:10,369 --> 00:51:15,019
that you know that kind of thing or

00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:16,759
these last five are wrong or this

00:51:15,019 --> 00:51:18,319
editorial thing is still wrong in all

00:51:16,759 --> 00:51:22,130
these versions like we need to fix that

00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:24,499
so what we need services to do we as

00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:27,499
annotation people everywhere is just

00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:28,940
identify stuff better and that's part of

00:51:27,499 --> 00:51:30,979
what's being explored at the digital

00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:33,559
publishing working group that's just

00:51:30,979 --> 00:51:36,529
spinning up the w3c is how do we do that

00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:38,539
portably across the web such that if I

00:51:36,529 --> 00:51:39,739
were to email you a web page or what

00:51:38,539 --> 00:51:43,849
we're hoping to call portable web

00:51:39,739 --> 00:51:46,460
publications that my annotations that I

00:51:43,849 --> 00:51:48,650
sent in a maybe separate email anchor to

00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:50,930
your copy and everyone else's copy in

00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:53,269
the same way because it's known to be

00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:57,499
the same thing and how do you do that at

00:51:53,269 --> 00:51:58,660
like legitimately web-scale easy

00:51:57,499 --> 00:52:01,060
problems

00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:05,849
yeah thank you everybody

00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:05,849
