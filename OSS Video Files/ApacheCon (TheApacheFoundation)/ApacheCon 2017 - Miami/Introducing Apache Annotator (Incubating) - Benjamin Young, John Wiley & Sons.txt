	Introducing Apache Annotator (Incubating) - Benjamin Young, John Wiley & Sons

Apache Annotator (incubating) is one of the newest incubating projects at the Apache Software Foundation.

The aim of this fledgling community is to bring several disparate groups into the same room to work on collective code and content to help build a better foundation for the future of annotation on and off the Web.

We'll take a look at Web Annotation Data Model and Web Annotation Protocol, some of the past history of Annotation on the Web, and Apache Annotator's plans to build a better future together.
