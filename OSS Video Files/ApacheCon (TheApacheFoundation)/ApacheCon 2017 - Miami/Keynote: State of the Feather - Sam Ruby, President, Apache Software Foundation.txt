	00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:06,600
this is my first presentation giving a

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,970
state of the feather as president I was

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,250
recently elected to sort of aim that I

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:15,360
have a tendency to start fast and

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,560
accelerate so feel free to interject

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,500
your ask questions

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,609
I'm currently a SF president I'm also

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,410
assistant secretary as rich stated VP of

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,930
whimsy which is actually a real title

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:32,309
there's a project by the name of whimsy

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:34,590
that I helped create I've studied them a

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:36,090
lot of the attendant I study a lot of

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,559
these stay the feathers they typically

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,960
start out with some statistics talking

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,270
about commuters members PMC's paddling

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,230
some groups I'll come back to that later

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:51,329
and they also start with a pretty graph

00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:52,829
okay Jen does tend to start with things

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,690
like how we got here what we believe in

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,640
and how we are different I'm going to do

00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,600
it slightly different this presentation

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,520
is not just a Apache is great we'll talk

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,530
about how many good things we do but I

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,420
also identify what works and what I

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:12,390
think where there's some more work that

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:14,280
needs to be done in fact in essence a

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,900
list is going to give the standard talk

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:21,470
I've seen for the backwards so Apache is

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,610
which says been around for 18 plus years

00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,950
we're continuing to grow by every

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,250
measure no matter how you look at it we

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,810
are growing more importantly we expect

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,119
to continue to be around to expect to

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,930
continue to grow so this this foundation

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,579
is thriving perhaps even a bit too fast

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,780
if there's anything we worried about we

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,369
worry about the fact that we're growing

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:48,119
too fast or can we keep up can we firm

00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:50,340
continue to grow our secret diversity

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:54,000
independence and openness I've distilled

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,430
this from a number of places on our

00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,570
website the like these are the things

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:03,180
that make us what we are excerpts from

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,770
incubation X criteria demonstrate an

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,030
active and diverse development community

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,280
there's at least three legally

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,229
independent computers and no single

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,230
company or entities success the project

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:16,780
and develop an execute

00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:19,840
these are sort of core to what we are

00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:22,219
and more importantly we mean it

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,790
no one committer has more say than any

00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:27,499
other commuter as to what codes accepted

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:32,239
no 1 PMC members any more say than the

00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:36,409
other PMC member all ASF members have

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,730
equal votes no director is any more

00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:40,120
ability assets cause he and any other

00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:43,159
director everyone is equal

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,750
concrete example Tomcats a bunch of

00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:46,129
people here probably know what that

00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,560
project is we've been involved with it

00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:51,099
in one way or another I was the first

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,870
nonce unreleased manager for Tom Capps

00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:56,959
I've been here for 17 years director for

00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:59,689
13 years I'm a SF member since 2000

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:04,400
apparently and I currently hold as head

00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:05,780
of a SF president while I'm no longer

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,340
active on a particular project there's

00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,109
lots of projects I'm active on Tomcats

00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,540
not one of them at the moment I'm fully

00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:12,980
confident that I'd be welcomed back

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:16,099
promptly and enthusiastically if I chose

00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:18,500
to participate again at just how we tend

00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:21,979
to operate but more importantly but only

00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,569
as an equal I've seen examples over time

00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:25,759
when individuals of come back during

00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:28,159
individual projects and expect to have a

00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:33,829
special status based on their prior

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:38,569
history that's not how we work not

00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:40,069
saying it's easy we counter EDF L and

00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:42,340
now its own dictator for life want to be

00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:44,930
the incubation we do have people who

00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,720
there are projects outside the SF who

00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:49,759
operate quite successfully that way just

00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,419
not inside the SF we do not allow such

00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:56,000
things everyone being equal is an

00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:58,370
important tenant to us we have key MCS

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,199
one to release with our boats everyone

00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,519
has a reason why they want release

00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,680
faster they want to do all sorts of

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,340
things but unless it's got the backing

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:11,079
of the PMC demonstrably that's important

00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:13,759
to us that it that's how we do releases

00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:14,989
we have over-exuberant companies wanting

00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:16,430
to create press releases talking about

00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:20,180
employees leadership when they become

00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:23,790
PMC chairs and immediately we have sally

00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:26,820
on the far left of my help

00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:28,680
correct them in their perceptions we do

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:32,790
not have leaders here we have a bunch of

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,380
equals and we have graveyards sorting

00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,320
them back in the day

00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,280
thank you done differently and alike

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,510
they also are equals

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:44,040
we also are equals not saying is equal

00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,700
and I think it's easy all contributors

00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,070
are important

00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,690
no contributors are replaceable these

00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:51,140
two statements are both true even though

00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:54,240
they fee if they're slightly in conflict

00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:57,480
everyone is important everyone is

00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,990
replaceable we it's important to us that

00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:03,510
a project continues to thrive if any one

00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:06,120
person or one company or one anything

00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:11,250
chooses to leave we have people over

00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:12,990
time who do leave we talk about that in

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,550
terms of community over code the

00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,260
community or to us is more important

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,690
than the fact that we've got to coddle

00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:22,220
one individual contributor who feels

00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,220
that they are more special than others

00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,310
I'm not saying it's easy another place

00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,440
where it's not easy we have a business

00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,700
friendly license we welcome and

00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,190
appreciate donates through generous

00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:35,700
sponsors we have a strict vendor neutral

00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:38,220
policy we want the contributions of our

00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:42,360
sponsors we want the people who are

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,620
employed by companies to participate we

00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,950
want the companies they'll take their

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,400
stuff back but we do not give companies

00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:51,960
any special treatment based on that

00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,410
that's a different that's a difficult

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,760
balance to constantly strive for

00:05:54,410 --> 00:06:01,350
particularly when we are looking for

00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:02,850
revenue I'm not saying it's easy 100

00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,920
people plenty hundred small conferences

00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:08,000
may work but having 20 people planning

00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:10,350
one big conference doesn't work so

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,420
trying to find out where the balances

00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,160
are where we have a couple of individual

00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:17,610
cases mostly in operations will we end

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:22,770
up saying we need more strict hierarchy

00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:24,480
versus equality letting a PMC have their

00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,830
own brand policy may affect other PMC's

00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,730
ability to enforce their mark that's

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,620
something that we had a lengthy

00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:30,930
discussion the board with for the last

00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,810
several months I'm pleased with how that

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,040
turned out

00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:38,730
having committers work on what they want

00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:41,150
to work on may work but having Sicilians

00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:43,500
choosing on their Fun tickets doesn't

00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,750
there are to run the business you

00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,870
actually need to actually have things

00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:51,720
done in order and priority and the like

00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:53,910
and our way to address that last point

00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,620
is sometimes the solution is to turn on

00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,380
fun or time-critical tasks into paid

00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,630
positions well we have substantial

00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:03,120
reserves are currently running on

00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,950
sustainable deficit I won't show that

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,180
numbers here they are available to all

00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:10,170
but we actually are running a deficit a

00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,060
significant deficit for the first time

00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,650
we do have substantial reserves more

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,560
than a year's reserves but we do need to

00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:19,500
figure out how to to fund ourselves

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,790
better expanding the pool of sponsors

00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,060
may be one of the questions I sort of

00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:25,560
ROI return on investment investment

00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:29,190
investment we talk to sponsors every day

00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,600
and it's very you can get sponsored for

00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,010
things like Apache con because you get

00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,510
booth space and all sorts of things but

00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,520
what do you get for a pet is sponsoring

00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:37,050
Apache well you get a mention our thanks

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,700
page we're looking rather hard to figure

00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:44,850
out how we can improve that without

00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:47,640
compromising who we are not saying it's

00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:50,430
easy the things that are worth doing

00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,720
aren't always easy and supporting

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:55,260
communities that have made the ASF a

00:07:51,720 --> 00:08:00,150
home for these 18 plus years is

00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:01,950
definitely worth doing recapping our

00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:06,660
core values diversity independence and

00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:08,730
openness hopefully what I just said give

00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,620
you more of an appreciation as to what

00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:12,420
we mean by those and where we actually

00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,070
struggle I'm trying to find the balances

00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:17,010
and why they're important to our

00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:18,180
longevity any one of us could disappear

00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:22,710
and hopefully the whole foundation

00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:25,050
continued even we have rare exceptions

00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,230
there are places where we don't have a

00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:30,510
strict equality we do have hierarchies

00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:33,210
and I hope that doesn't minimize the

00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:36,030
message I'm trying to send we struggle

00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:38,550
for each of those times returning the

00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:41,240
statistics you got it d 8:22 commuters

00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:43,610
by my last count on

00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,110
that doesn't distinguish between people

00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,300
who are committed only on the puddling

00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:49,310
lowers they haven't been successfully

00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,080
through incubation and the number of

00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,390
commuters who've been around for a lot

00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,180
longer but even so we have thousands of

00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:59,839
people who have been in essence taught

00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:03,500
the Apache way and participate as equals

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,330
on one of our many projects 684 people

00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,480
have been recognized for the sustained

00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:10,430
contributions as members hundred

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,570
eighty-one PMC's depending on how you

00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,120
count we've got different numbers for

00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:18,890
effort it's all in this ballpark these

00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:22,399
are active PMC's that that are producing

00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:23,990
the code bases that many of us use 59

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,370
pod legs these are the one of you

00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:28,250
projects these are the ones that will

00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,610
end up most many of them will end up

00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:33,470
graduating and become full-fledged

00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:36,470
projects once they end up graduating so

00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:39,170
we have a large queue of projects that

00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,910
it wants to join us and that's part of

00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,620
our growth that that number being that

00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,959
big means we're gonna continue to grow

00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,330
and ninety six other various assorted

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,790
other groups but hopefully now you see

00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,440
more context these numbers it's reason

00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:55,640
wise did my presentation backwards it's

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,980
giving me some more the pretty graphic

00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:02,420
went by quickly the most important thing

00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:07,040
is the orangish line that is showing

00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:08,839
growth of the number of projects i'm

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,420
pleased to say that's sort of linear

00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:13,180
it's not really exponential so much we

00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:16,400
actually are growing we're actually

00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,930
maintaining a growth pattern the the

00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,459
slight downturn you see here's we're

00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,040
actually more active recently in

00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:23,690
retiring projects that have gotten to

00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,450
the point where there aren't people

00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,920
pretending pretending on them but the

00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:30,170
fact that linear means it's probably

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,050
manageable if we're exponential I'd be

00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:35,150
more scared but we do have issues that

00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,450
we need to deal with you're managing

00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,450
both

00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:45,339
and finally an appreciation with the

00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,339
following enables sponsors and donors

00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:50,000
platinum sponsors I'm not going to

00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,100
release read all their names basically

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,260
we've got a large number of platen

00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,620
sponsors who have got substantial

00:10:54,260 --> 00:11:02,839
commitments to the ASF gold sponsors

00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:05,420
silver sponsors bronze infrastructure

00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:07,690
sponsors people that sponsor individual

00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:10,130
things in incubation main in

00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:13,220
infrastructure special thanks to apache

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:14,690
khan apache big data sponsors this rich

00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,930
show the slide for it it's a little more

00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:22,430
of an eye chart to mike case but try to

00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:23,990
get all of them on there and you too can

00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:27,709
support apache if you choose to do so

00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,940
there is this icon on we're trying to

00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:30,709
get it on all other pages we're not

00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,149
quite there yet but you will see at

00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:34,339
least on our main pages on many of our

00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:35,870
project pages you click on that and

00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:37,790
you'll go to another place that will end

00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:42,829
up giving you all sorts of different

00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:45,640
options to contribute and said i start

00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:52,220
fast and accelerate

00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:52,220
