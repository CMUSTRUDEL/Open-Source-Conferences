	Evaluating Text Extraction: Apache Tika's™ New Tika-Eval Module - Tim Allison, The MITRE Corporation

Text extraction tools are essential for obtaining the textual content and metadata of computer files for use in a wide variety of applications, including search and natural language processing tools. Techniques and tools for evaluating text extraction tools are missing from academia and industry. 

Apache Tika™ detects file types and extracts metadata and text from many file types. Tika is a crucial component in a wide variety of tools, including Solr™, Nutch™, Alfresco, Elasticsearch and Sleuth Kit®/Autopsy®.

In this talk, we will give an overview of the new tika-eval module that allows developers to evaluate Tika and other content extraction systems. This talk will end with a brief discussion of the results of taking this evaluation methodology public and evaluating Tika on large batches of public domain documents on a public vm over the last two years.
