	Gaining Insight Into Your Apache Project with Snoot - Daniel Gruno, Quenda

Metrics are good - the right metrics are even better! In Open Source, diversity, openness and meritocracy matters, and getting the right sort of metrics can help you and your project assess whether you are on the right track and just how fast this track is. In this talk, I will guide Apache contributors through Snoot, an analytics suite for Open Source projects. We will be looking at standard open source metrics such as commit volumes, issues opened/resolved over time, interactions via email, IRC etc, and slowly dive into advanced diversity charts, cross-project relationships and see how projects, categories and even the entire foundation compare to other segments. We will also discuss what is expected of projects in relation to community oversight.
