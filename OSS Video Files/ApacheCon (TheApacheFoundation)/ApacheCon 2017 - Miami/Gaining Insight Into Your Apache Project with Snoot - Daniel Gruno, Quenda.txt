Description: 
	Gaining Insight Into Your Apache Project with Snoot - Daniel Gruno, Quenda

Metrics are good - the right metrics are even better! In Open Source, diversity, openness and meritocracy matters, and getting the right sort of metrics can help you and your project assess whether you are on the right track and just how fast this track is. In this talk, I will guide Apache contributors through Snoot, an analytics suite for Open Source projects. We will be looking at standard open source metrics such as commit volumes, issues opened/resolved over time, interactions via email, IRC etc, and slowly dive into advanced diversity charts, cross-project relationships and see how projects, categories and even the entire foundation compare to other segments. We will also discuss what is expected of projects in relation to community oversight.

okay I'll just talk now so welcome to

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,059
this talk I have no one to introduce me

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:13,230
but I'm Daniel and I work for Apache and

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:17,310
kwinda which is company Oh Dusk's all

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:21,800
sorts open-source whatever we like and

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:25,980
I'm going to talk about snoot which is a

00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:29,039
interactive activity aggregator so what

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:32,270
it does is it pulls in everything that

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,710
the ASF or any other organization does

00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:37,890
like code development community

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,710
discussing discussions interactions

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,640
whether it's on email or mailing lists

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:47,820
or github or issues in JIRA or rockzilla

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,390
or whatever and posting all the the

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,670
people that are contributing to BASF and

00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:58,469
displays that in with pretty graphs and

00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:01,699
some text it started as a simple line of

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:05,549
code counter we got a request from a

00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:07,560
large organization that said we would

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,260
like to count all the lines of code we

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,470
have in our repositories can you do that

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:18,720
and so we started out counting all the

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:21,659
lines and we thought we wanted to see um

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,420
some graphs how stuff has evolved over

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:27,060
time and then we started making some

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,340
charts and then we kind of said to

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,509
ourselves why why stop at code why not

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:37,439
go in and pick out bugs and email and

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:40,259
online messaging and changes in

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:44,759
communities and so on and then it kind

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:50,880
of evolved and this is the one of this

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:52,250
works this is the ASF over time the

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,090
lines of code we have in our

00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:59,159
repositories of 838 repositories we have

00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:03,000
as you can see we just hit the 150

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:06,360
million lines of code this March so

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,959
congrats to us and and below you can see

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,519
the evolution in each different language

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:16,379
at the ASF

00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:18,870
this is obviously Java no surprise there

00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:23,569
you see that's almost half the entire

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:26,670
ASF codebase so we added more and more

00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:28,799
charts and we made an API so you can go

00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:32,250
in and get whatever you want for

00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:34,379
yourself which also enabled us to make

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:39,870
it a dynamic webpage where you can go

00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:42,690
and interactively get all the stuff you

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:47,489
want whenever you want it with live data

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:50,700
it updates on the fly so it's pretty

00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:53,940
much a gigantic clustered chronologic

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:57,690
job that runs every night at 2:00 a.m.

00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:01,079
my time and it goes and says to the SF

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:03,450
what's changed so it takes up all the

00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:05,400
commits it takes up all the open or

00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,799
closed tickets the new email the online

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,799
messaging whether it's IRC or slack or

00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:15,209
whatever it even goes in and checks the

00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:19,019
downloads of ASF codebase and pastes

00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:21,090
widgets on github and everything that

00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:24,060
you can actually count from BASF and

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:27,379
then it puts it in a database and it

00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:30,569
does an on-the-fly data crunching

00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:34,530
whenever you request a chart or a

00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:36,540
statistic or whatever we have about

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,639
three hundred and forty thousand people

00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,620
in the database and that is people who

00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:44,280
send an email or open the ticket or

00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,079
commit code or has done anything related

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,419
to the ESF so this is the amount of

00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:53,150
people that have interacted with the ASF

00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:53,150
in the past 23 years

00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:59,760
so some it may seem like a lot and some

00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:02,400
it seems like not a lot but that's the

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,230
figure we have we have around 20 million

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,440
emails that we have in the database as

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:10,889
well two and a half million commits to

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:13,680
get or SVN we mostly use the the gate

00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:16,229
mirrors because as much as I like SVN

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,940
it's a bit faster getting the log of

00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:18,919
changes from get so we're pulling the

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,079
get nervous and then

00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:24,800
do a get lock and then go through

00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:27,560
everything and take that every day we

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,749
have nearly a million tickets India and

00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,479
Bugzilla that we have also pulled in

00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:35,779
that took a few days because there is

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:38,419
not the fastest of things and we didn't

00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:40,249
want to overload it but we have all that

00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:42,199
now and what we do every day every night

00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:43,639
is just going to say what's changed so

00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,879
we just pull in like a thousand tickets

00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:48,849
and then just cause that

00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:51,979
so yeah one hundred and fifty five

00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:52,699
million entries crammed into seven

00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:57,650
machines

00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:59,930
two big ones and five small ones and

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,240
it's it's open to all commuters so if

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:04,759
you're not if don't have a an account on

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,550
snute yet you can go to develop that's

00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:09,949
new at i/o and use your a tap a cheater

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,169
or email address and then this specific

00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:14,870
invite code is important you use that

00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:17,300
code if you want to get into the ASAP

00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:19,069
organization otherwise you'll just get

00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:23,479
into a demo organization we have to

00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:26,659
invite you and that's troublesome you

00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:28,639
can do that by now on the the Wi-Fi I

00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,620
took a lot of screenshots because

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,080
sometimes if we have like 20 people

00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,599
using the ASF instance on Luud it can

00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,240
get a bit slow because it is live data

00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:41,810
crunching so it I guess we're slow

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:45,259
sometimes and for those not a commuter

00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:47,719
will hopefully show like them I was your

00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:49,219
live demo later on with some of the

00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:52,069
stuff that you can see in some of the

00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:53,330
stuff you can't see and since Sally is

00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:58,159
not here I'll show you some the stuff

00:05:53,330 --> 00:06:00,199
that she does include you to see so it

00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:04,219
since that it's interactive you can go

00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:07,399
and pick any time span like May 2016 2

00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:10,009
April 2017 or a specific project or

00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:13,909
specific repository or a specific bug

00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:16,159
tracker or any specific contributors and

00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:19,159
you can see the stats for them or the

00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:21,639
project or the repo and see what's going

00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:24,979
on here in this specific time span

00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:30,169
mm-hmm so you can go and see what am i

00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:32,719
doing or broader what's Jim doing and

00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:37,340
how does that relate to how the projects

00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:39,860
is doing so this is me as you can see it

00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:43,219
see the commits I've made you can see I

00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:45,499
was pretty active at some point and then

00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:48,020
kind of lost interest and then I got

00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:51,860
active again you can see the lives I've

00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:54,889
changed which is kind of a it's just a

00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,900
fun fun chart to make you can see the

00:06:54,889 --> 00:07:01,159
emails I've written over time you can

00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:03,650
see I was very active when I started it

00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:06,199
oh that's pretty 15 that's not when I

00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:08,509
started that and but I was active then

00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:12,229
and I'm sort of active now you can see

00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:14,229
the tickets I've made or closed it's

00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:16,490
closed quite a bit tickets

00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:18,800
serious and not really made a lot of

00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,509
tickets and you can see the projects

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,839
that I'm contributing to so you can see

00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:26,620
I love Pony mail and I work on

00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:30,169
infrastructure so I also commit to that

00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,789
and the other repos and you can all go

00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:33,860
in and see your own profile and you can

00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:37,370
see when you started at the aesthetic

00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:41,360
see I started in 2012 so I have my fifth

00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:44,270
anniversary at the ASF now and you can

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,270
see when I send my first email when I

00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:49,669
contribute my first line of code and I

00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:52,189
guess you can do that for every single

00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:54,169
person at the alias' app which is also

00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:57,379
kind of cool because you can go and you

00:07:54,169 --> 00:08:02,270
can see when did when is someone having

00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:04,789
in the anniversary at the ASF so it's

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:07,310
publishable which means you can go and

00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:10,099
you can get a widget and you can publish

00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:12,409
every single chart or piece of data from

00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:15,379
snoot on your website it will then go in

00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:16,699
and take the live data and hear that on

00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:20,419
your website we actually have that on

00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:22,669
projects tokachi org so if you go to

00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:25,490
that website you can see all statistics

00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:30,050
for the entire ESS at the moment and

00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:32,240
it's got a public API it's I think it's

00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:36,169
like 120 pages long the the API

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,919
documentation so if you really want to

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:41,300
spend time on that you you're welcome

00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,690
so you can go in and check everything

00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,440
that is on snoop you can

00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:51,030
grab and display publicly if you have a

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:53,520
token so let's just get started with how

00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,440
you interact with snoot the first thing

00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,950
you want to do is create a view a view

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,530
is a collection of sources everything in

00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:04,290
snoot is a source like a git repos sorts

00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:06,540
and mailing the source a bug tracker is

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:08,670
a source a flag channel or an IRC

00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:12,120
channel is a source and we have around

00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,830
5,000 different sources at the ASF so

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,830
what you do is you say I want to watch

00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:18,720
this and this and this source and I want

00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,580
to call it cloud stack or whatever

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,970
source you're watching and then you

00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:27,020
create a view and then you find a time

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:29,730
frame for when you want to watch the

00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:32,040
activity for that specific cluster of

00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,690
repositories and then you have fun with

00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,580
it

00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,560
and then you can publish it and use it

00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:40,320
in your board reports and so on and so

00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,810
on so as I said it's a collection of

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,210
sources and it's personal so you can

00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:47,940
create your own view and that's just

00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:50,670
yours and some people like pervy and

00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:53,310
sally and so and so on can make some

00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:56,340
public views that every single ASF

00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:58,230
commuter can go in and use and we have I

00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:01,320
think they have ten of those that

00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:04,620
everyone can use this is my views I have

00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,450
a quite a few of them because I like to

00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,300
toy around with the patio projects and

00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:11,460
you create a view by clicking the create

00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:15,450
view button the key of one at the top

00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:18,450
and then you type in for example flex

00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:21,540
and then you use a regular expression to

00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:24,390
say I want to take stuff called flex and

00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,950
it takes all the sources that have some

00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,740
sort of relation to flex and then you

00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:31,110
save it and then you have a view and you

00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:34,380
can use this view to filter out all the

00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:38,370
other things now the ASF does and just

00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:41,310
show what's flex doing at the moment so

00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:44,700
this is a view this is the default taste

00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:48,240
for view you get the code composition

00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:52,080
like what sort of language is flex or

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,730
whatever this is written in you get how

00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,260
many lines of code are there how many

00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,660
comments are there how many plan

00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:00,990
anxious kind of what although open hub

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:03,450
does you can see the commute activity

00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:06,510
you can see how many people are

00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:08,730
committing how many are in SDNS is

00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:10,770
saying but in get you can see how many

00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,050
people are authoring code and how many

00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:15,390
people are committing code which gives

00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:18,180
you an idea of how many contributors are

00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:20,160
there versus how many commuters and do

00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:22,560
we maybe need to invite someone who is

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,410
contributing or offering code into the

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,930
coming a committer you can see like the

00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:30,240
lines change again this is just for fun

00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:32,190
and you can see the development of the

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,160
code the evolution of the code over time

00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:38,040
you can also click and see each separate

00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:40,580
language inside the code what they were

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,560
looking at that has JavaScript or Java

00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:47,310
overtaken C at some point in this

00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:51,180
project and why so what do we need to

00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:53,430
snoop for most of all for the ASF is for

00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:57,120
for reports and community outreach it's

00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:59,130
for finding out what is going on the

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,990
projects what are the trends are we in

00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:06,900
law are we stealing at for speed or what

00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,430
what's going on we also needed to see if

00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,500
the community is growing if the

00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:12,270
community is healthy if we are inviting

00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,810
new commuters in if we have someone we

00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:18,420
should invite in and yeah making sure

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:21,140
the project is not dead because nobody

00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:24,690
likes that plastic except Henry maybe

00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:27,450
and also you can go in and you can find

00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:29,460
out other of other projects that are

00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:31,590
working on something related to what we

00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:34,410
do are there may be committees that are

00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:37,110
on two or three different projects that

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:40,770
we could work together with us I'll show

00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:44,040
you later what I mean about that so yeah

00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:47,370
what reports are used by the PNC the

00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,890
project management committees to inform

00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:54,170
the board of directors how are we doing

00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:56,850
are we still alive what's going on and

00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:59,820
the the items in blue are the stuff you

00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:02,070
can get unstuck the items in black you

00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,500
should just write yourself and most

00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:06,960
people don't bother writing that they

00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,300
should and so normally you would put

00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,100
what does this party do

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:14,310
are there any issues that require board

00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:17,310
attention like do we have a bad in fight

00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:19,760
somewhere the screen some people or if

00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:23,190
something not being maintained probably

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,140
then a short pivot summary what's going

00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:28,710
on what's the major issues what the

00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:31,470
major activity and the project community

00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:32,940
health how is the community doing the

00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,470
project the software doesn't really

00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,960
matter to the board what matters is the

00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:40,920
community it's a community healthy is it

00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:44,640
not healthy and then you got some some

00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:46,560
pre standard procedure things have we

00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:50,210
invited new people into the committers

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:55,170
ships or the pmc how we lost someone or

00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:58,020
any Y and then software releases that we

00:13:55,170 --> 00:14:00,330
release anything did not are we going to

00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:03,870
release anything and then the final

00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:05,610
thing is code mainly lists issues what

00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,290
have we been doing that we have some

00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:11,000
stickers on that we can present to the

00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:16,860
board is it slowing down its speeding up

00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:19,530
what's going on so yeah I kind of have a

00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:22,440
tendency to talk about my next slide in

00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:25,230
my previous slide so I'll just skip this

00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:28,200
one if I already tell you and so in

00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:30,120
snute you can get a summary of all the

00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,880
various things on the top of each page

00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:36,600
so you can see the this is just an

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,670
example for I don't know what project

00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,350
flex maybe you gives you only alliances

00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:43,380
can change how many commuters have been

00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:46,440
active within let's say three months

00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:49,440
that's the usual board report cycle so

00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:52,320
you can see it's going yeah okay it's

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,150
it's okay but it's going down so some

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,880
people are not committing that was

00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:58,950
committing three months ago you can see

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,050
the commits have really gone up so

00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:02,400
that's hopefully positive you can be

00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:04,620
close to the board that there's a lot of

00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,900
activity going on even though fewer

00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:09,930
people are participating in it you can

00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,880
see the number of tickets closed opened

00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:15,480
how many people closed it on they open

00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:18,570
it which is also a good indicator of if

00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:21,889
the other problems surrounding the code

00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:24,259
being solved or not or we just opening

00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:26,959
500 tickets every week and no one's

00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:29,420
actually working on them and finally

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,730
their mailing list how many people all

00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:34,249
same sending emails how many different

00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:37,670
topics have been discussed and how many

00:15:34,249 --> 00:15:39,739
mails in total and again it's this going

00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,559
up or down compared to the previous

00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:44,869
cycle and you can pick any cycle this is

00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:46,249
a standard six months cycle I think it'd

00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:49,609
be false - you can pick three months you

00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:51,679
can pick twenty years and see what's

00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:56,089
been going on in this time span compared

00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:58,160
to the previous 20 years so community

00:15:56,089 --> 00:16:00,290
health matters to the board because as

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,319
Sam also said in the keynote community

00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:05,269
is more important than code the board

00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:08,329
doesn't care about whether you've

00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:09,859
released some fancy new feature or not

00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:11,929
it cares about what the community is

00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:13,970
healthy because if the community is

00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,829
healthy the code will also be healthy

00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:17,209
like as in Waynesville if you book them

00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:20,509
they will come if you got a community

00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:23,540
the code will be written at at some

00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:26,720
point so that's what the board really

00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:29,629
looks looks for and it's also allowed

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:33,519
for you because deep down we are good

00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:37,279
persons we want people to get along and

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:39,889
also diverse minds and diverse friends

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,619
and I don't mean by gender or

00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:44,509
nationality or anything I mean a diverse

00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:47,269
opinion in the project is really

00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:50,419
important it allows you to find things

00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:52,489
that you wouldn't otherwise see and from

00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:55,100
my personal experience I have a tendency

00:16:52,489 --> 00:16:58,179
to scope out an entire project in my

00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:00,439
mind and then I just code it the way I

00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:02,389
think is the best and then you got

00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:04,970
someone else coming in and say but hang

00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:09,889
on to me this doesn't make sense or this

00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:10,970
is the wrong approach and I'll be wow I

00:17:09,889 --> 00:17:13,399
didn't think of that

00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:15,380
because I'm just me and if I have ten

00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:18,169
dangles next to me we'll get a lot of

00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:21,439
coding done but it'll be all the same

00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:23,750
mindset and thus we are going to miss

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:27,740
some things so it's important to get a

00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:31,279
have a diverse group of people in the

00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:34,399
project so are we gaining or we're

00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:35,930
losing people you can you can see this

00:17:34,399 --> 00:17:39,260
on snoop

00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:41,180
how many people commit how many Autocode

00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:44,480
there and get those difference between

00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:46,430
those two what is the trend are we

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,330
getting more committers for getting more

00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:52,700
authors yeah we can also see on the use

00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,830
list on the death list

00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,050
it's the useless more active than the

00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:58,910
death list which is usually a good sign

00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:00,770
that you have a lot of users if you only

00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:03,440
have activity on the death list bill

00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:06,590
you're probably making a lot of code but

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,780
you're not providing it to anyone

00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:11,450
because there are no uses of it so

00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:13,700
that's a good thing to go in and measure

00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:17,929
if you have a useless some projects only

00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:20,270
have a dead lift and so and like I said

00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:24,230
before our tickets being closed we can

00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:27,590
open or is everything okay do we need

00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:29,240
more people helping out it's a good

00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,770
indicator of do we need to do some

00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,100
outreach to the community and find

00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:38,090
people to help us fix these issues we

00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:40,130
have a talk tomorrow about software ECC

00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:43,070
community's heart or something like that

00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:45,920
which also is going to talk about some

00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:48,620
of the issues of bringing in new

00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,120
contributors because it's not difficult

00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,340
to bring in new contributors if you see

00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,670
that you need them you just need to

00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:59,510
reach out because like on Stack Overflow

00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:01,580
for example you have for the attack

00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:03,230
elixir where you have thousands of

00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:05,630
people that want to contribute and say

00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,280
this is how we solve a problem and we're

00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:09,350
sitting over in this corner seeing oh we

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,400
have tons of tickets no one's closing

00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:14,720
them what can we do well what we can do

00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,730
is we can reach out to all those

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:21,740
thousands of people and say come on over

00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:23,540
and help us close these tickets but we

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,790
kind of need to know first that there's

00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:28,360
a problem and then we also gotta know

00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:32,929
that there are people willing to help

00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:35,750
yeah and finally conversions are we

00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:38,290
converting people from for example Stack

00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:42,260
Overflow or from the user list to active

00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:44,870
contributors solving issues filing dogs

00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:47,409
solving box made a contributing code or

00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:50,080
these patches

00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:52,299
and this is a prosthetic leg or weakened

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,980
getting more and more new people or is

00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:55,320
it just the same old people contributing

00:19:53,980 --> 00:20:00,250
all the time

00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:03,490
mmm so this is pretty much the same

00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:07,210
thing so yeah this would be possible

00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:09,760
reactivity we've been over that this is

00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:12,370
the mailing list activity you can go and

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,049
you can see who's actually writing to

00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:17,409
the mailing list at the moment who's the

00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:19,360
disused author and you can see how many

00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:21,789
topics are there how many authors are

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,500
there is there a trend are we getting

00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:27,460
more and more emails on a specific list

00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:29,740
or is it slowing down or is the

00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,770
deadliest overtaking the used list or is

00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:35,169
it the other way around and then you can

00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:37,299
report back to the board saying we are

00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:39,039
getting more and more user traffic which

00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:41,350
hopefully means we get more and more

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,779
users and then the board will say great

00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:49,980
you're doing a great job at outreach to

00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:54,450
the users and then got issues this is I

00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:56,919
think it's all the if you'd trackers

00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:59,440
yeah it's all the issue tracker said the

00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:01,090
ASF so it's got a big number you can see

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,250
how many people are closing how many

00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:06,820
people are opening issues you can see

00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:09,010
the top people that are really good at

00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:11,649
opening issues that people that are

00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:14,049
really good at closing the tickets you

00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:17,049
can see the busiest tickets so if you

00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:18,760
want a really long conversation to read

00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:21,549
you can go and find those tickets and

00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:24,730
read them and you can also see here how

00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:28,779
many tickets are unresolved over time

00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:31,450
and this is usually like an exponential

00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:36,070
thing because New York tickets tend to

00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:40,140
be sorry tend to be close and those here

00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:40,140
tend to be just hanging around

00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:46,090
I forget Boris going with that I had

00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:48,310
that it's usually an exponential thing

00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:52,530
curve and there was a reason for it but

00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:56,830
I forgot it so sorry about that

00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:59,020
yeah I'll go back is there like a three

00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:06,940
person overlapping about pipe openers in

00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:09,700
the closes open that I think not that I

00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:12,040
can see oh well some people can be both

00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:15,010
top closes and opener openers and

00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,330
closers that's not uncommon because

00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:18,310
people who open the issues in both

00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:21,130
assign them to themselves and they close

00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:23,080
them again so that's completely normal

00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,730
and also you can you can be a top closer

00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,300
in one project and a top opener in

00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:33,640
another project this is the entire ESS

00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:35,980
so this is a fun chart when you report

00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:39,180
to the board you usually say are we

00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:42,700
getting new people in and this shows

00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:45,940
especially forget not so much for SVN

00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:49,270
due to the nature of commutes but forget

00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:51,700
you can see how many people have not

00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:54,400
contributed before the the red area and

00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:57,550
the newcomers but are contributing in

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,010
this period of time so the red are

00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:01,870
people that have never been seen before

00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:04,120
writing code for this project the blue

00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:06,610
are people that usually like code and

00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:09,310
still write code for the project and the

00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:11,470
green a tiny green area up there is

00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:13,240
people that have been writing codes and

00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:16,420
then they went away for 10 years or

00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,400
whatever and now they're back which is

00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:21,130
also a good thing getting there the

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,470
great beers back and because we really

00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:25,540
like them and you can see who is

00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:28,120
actually now contributing that most

00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:31,090
contributing for before both in code and

00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:34,380
in in issue so who's opening tickets now

00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:37,650
there wasn't opening tickets before and

00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:41,230
this is the conversion chart you can see

00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:43,930
who is an issue contributor before and

00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:45,910
it's now contributing code and how long

00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:48,160
did it take them for before they from

00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:50,440
from opening their first ticket since

00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,600
we're making the first patch so you can

00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,489
see how fast do we convert people from

00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,129
being users to being

00:23:54,489 --> 00:23:59,440
someone needs to scratch and yet to

00:23:57,129 --> 00:24:03,450
being someone that contributes code to

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:06,489
the project and we can also use that see

00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:08,619
if someone is offering code but it's not

00:24:06,489 --> 00:24:11,950
a committer yet maybe we should invite

00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:14,169
them in and then again we got people who

00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:16,479
send an email and are not contributing

00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:19,869
code and you can see how fast that

00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:22,840
conversion is so this fellow here pretty

00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:25,269
fast conversion now I'll show you

00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,429
something new that we haven't had at the

00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:30,580
ASF for 20 years but we have that now

00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:32,049
which is downloads you can actually go

00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,359
in the student and you can see how many

00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:36,489
people have been downloading Apache

00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:39,099
source code and you can see where they

00:24:36,489 --> 00:24:42,549
are from so this is cloud stack you can

00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:46,049
see it's very popular in China also in

00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:49,599
the US and it's pretty much all of

00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:53,769
America and Europe and Asia and not so

00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:57,849
much in Africa which is pretty standard

00:24:53,769 --> 00:24:59,739
if you go look at the download charts

00:24:57,849 --> 00:25:02,739
for the entire accept you'll see that

00:24:59,739 --> 00:25:04,960
every single station in the world in the

00:25:02,739 --> 00:25:09,809
past 3 months have downloaded software

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:13,509
from the ASF every single nation yeah

00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:17,739
forget also counting another flight but

00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:20,169
you know larger demo it's no it's just a

00:25:17,739 --> 00:25:22,359
number of Carlos we just track we can't

00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:23,619
track downloads because that goes to the

00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:26,950
mirrors and we don't have stats on

00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:29,349
mirror so this is the when you click to

00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:30,849
get a link for the mirror it goes in and

00:25:29,349 --> 00:25:33,429
injects where you're from and it locks

00:25:30,849 --> 00:25:37,719
that and that's probably be available so

00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:40,659
we just go in and grab that so but

00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:44,769
that's all the board reports I'm going

00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:47,559
to show you something a bit messy cross

00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:52,719
project relationships this is something

00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:54,580
that doesn't make sense at first but

00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:57,039
it's pretty crucial to the further

00:25:54,580 --> 00:26:01,690
existence of the ASF and what it shows

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:05,349
is for the past two years what projects

00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:06,669
have shared contributors that is someone

00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:11,049
caring for

00:26:06,669 --> 00:26:12,970
we'll take gym or shame or anyone who's

00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:14,889
working on one project then they move on

00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:17,320
they work on another project then they

00:26:14,889 --> 00:26:19,899
go back work on the web server and then

00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,389
they also work on whimsy that makes

00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:25,720
those cube projects linked they share a

00:26:22,389 --> 00:26:28,179
contributor and this shows how big a

00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:31,869
project is in terms of how many commits

00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:35,019
and all the lines show that this project

00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:36,940
is showing a commuter with this and the

00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:40,179
bigger the line is the more commuters

00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:42,970
are shared I'll hear your left message

00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:45,700
chart in a second but this can be real

00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:48,070
possible joint ventures two projects

00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,619
going together because they share if you

00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:53,049
share a committer you usually have some

00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:55,809
sort of segment in the project that is

00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:57,879
similar to the other project which

00:26:55,809 --> 00:26:59,529
children's up for a joint venture that

00:26:57,879 --> 00:27:01,389
people and projects can come together

00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:03,700
and work on something because if I'm

00:27:01,389 --> 00:27:05,230
interested in in the web server but I'm

00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,539
also interested in Steve

00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:09,730
they're probably connected and that

00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:12,519
means that other Apache web server

00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:15,999
developers could also go in and work on

00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:18,519
Steve or the other way around so there

00:27:15,999 --> 00:27:20,409
is an opportunity there to find people

00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:22,330
that you can bring into the project that

00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:26,919
already know about the Apache way and

00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:32,559
and that you can more quickly gain a

00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:36,460
bigger community so this is the big data

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:39,789
at Apache you can see that some of them

00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:41,830
are connected and some are not so a lot

00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:43,690
of these projects they have the same

00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:46,269
committers working on each different

00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:48,669
projects and they so it's more of a

00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:50,739
family for them and then you got a be

00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:53,440
the outer rims you got the projects that

00:27:50,739 --> 00:27:56,169
are not really connected so you got to

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,489
ask yourself why are they not connected

00:27:56,169 --> 00:27:59,320
to the other projects is there a

00:27:57,489 --> 00:28:02,769
specific reason for it do they have a

00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,210
silo culture where they just do in their

00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:06,399
own project and they don't really care

00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:08,769
about Apache or is there a different

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,749
reason for that and this is both

00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:14,470
interesting for the project but perhaps

00:28:10,749 --> 00:28:16,419
also for the board to see what's going

00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:19,650
so is there a specific reason for that

00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:22,680
or it's that just the way it is

00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:24,930
and this is the same thing but for bug

00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,310
trackers or issue trackers so you can

00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:30,000
see there's a bit more of a connection

00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:32,700
here which could be users of the

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,050
projects that are actually wanting to

00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:39,360
use this plastic in that project but

00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:43,050
then the developers are not developing

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,610
those two projects together so what's

00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,870
going on there at snoop can't really

00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:49,050
tell you what's going on you can just

00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:51,300
tell you that something is going on and

00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:53,940
what it can tell you is that people have

00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:57,570
an interest in developing our project as

00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:59,160
well as projects ooh and then perhaps we

00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:02,340
could get more people from plastic fool

00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:04,980
and also as I said we have people using

00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:07,050
two different projects maybe there's a

00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:10,080
common denominator in those projects

00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:12,000
that we could use lies more the next

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,210
thing is a bonus slide which is

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,910
something called radar maps and this

00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:20,220
tells you what is going on at cue device

00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:22,470
in a project compared to another project

00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:25,440
or perhaps to the entire foundation and

00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:27,870
this we have the ActiveMQ we have

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:32,700
sparking we have CouchDB and what you

00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:35,610
can see is that spark is way more active

00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:38,610
in filing bugs or solving box and then

00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:40,650
for example CouchDB is but couchdb is

00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:44,550
way more active in interacting with

00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:48,240
users mints pockets and you can this

00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:52,440
each step is a factor of five so this is

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:54,420
one in this 1000 times as active as the

00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,580
other projects so you can go and see

00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:59,370
what how's my project doing compared to

00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:01,530
the others if you see that these two are

00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:05,070
really really good at interacting with

00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:07,320
users and we're not that great maybe

00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:08,760
we'll go ask them and see how can we

00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:11,010
learn from them what are they doing that

00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:16,220
is so successful or do they just have

00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:18,690
more users so that is a fun chart for

00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:21,030
for projects you can also compare to the

00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:24,530
entire foundation see how are we doing

00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:27,990
compared to what the ASF in general does

00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:31,270
so as I said before you can you can

00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:34,290
publish all the bits of data on

00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:36,970
a year later how that's done hopefully

00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:38,770
so you can write up a blog post or email

00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:41,440
or board portal you can just put all

00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:46,750
those charts on your website or your

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:49,930
blog post or whatever you want and that

00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:53,530
is the presentation and then we'll go to

00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:56,110
the live demo so yeah this the

00:30:53,530 --> 00:31:00,400
presentation is there and you can poke

00:30:56,110 --> 00:31:03,250
me or Twitter me or email or IRC so

00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,230
we'll try for those that are not

00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:08,020
commuters we'll try on a live demo I

00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:11,610
think yeah this lip if my mask won't

00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:14,860
work so we can see here that we have

00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:17,290
sling for example what's that many

00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:20,080
commits in the past six months and it's

00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:24,490
connected to four different projects we

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:28,600
can also see that the specific line that

00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:32,860
the big one here as I can use mine it's

00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:35,290
not one you can see that arrow and park

00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:38,350
add to Apache projects have that many

00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:40,450
contributors in common so you can go and

00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:45,450
see where are people really doing cross

00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:45,450
project pollination and rather than not

00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:53,150
got a

00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:56,600
do something to get this we've got the

00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:58,549
waiter or not this is something that you

00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,290
will not get access to but I'll show you

00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:04,580
anyway

00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:05,870
this is the affiliation of companies the

00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:08,870
affiliation of people that are

00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:12,169
committing to the ASF so you can

00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:15,890
actually see all become this is not even

00:32:12,169 --> 00:32:18,169
20% of all commits to the SM it's huge

00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:20,480
the amount of companies that are have

00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:22,790
developers that contributes to the ASF

00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,820
it's really really really a lot of

00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:28,370
people so you can go and you can see

00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:31,790
what company is when did they start how

00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:34,240
active are they in the community or did

00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:39,679
they stop or do someone change jobs

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:44,900
which is kind of fun I am goes it so you

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:51,799
can see here this is the top top 15 or

00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:54,520
so and then that is not even 17 percent

00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:57,230
of the entire code base at the ASF it's

00:32:54,520 --> 00:33:01,280
genuinely a really really diverse

00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:06,169
community at the ASF but you won't see

00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:08,690
this Cassell said no so this is the the

00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:14,179
API documentation you can see it's a

00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:16,250
pretty goes on for a while and so on and

00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:18,169
so on and so on so if you want to grab

00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:23,809
some some data from from slewed you can

00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:25,309
do that their code relationships is

00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:27,650
there anything that anyone wants to see

00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:34,600
if anyone's not a commuter or don't have

00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:34,600
an account no yeah we go yeah

00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:58,420
we have a microphone for you or you can

00:33:45,460 --> 00:34:01,270
you speak up a bit yeah we do that

00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:04,270
mostly by email but also the the thing

00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:07,420
the top 500 most prominent commuters

00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:09,070
have been sort of profile so we know

00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:18,280
where they work and you can you can go

00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:23,050
in and if we find a big point let's just

00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:25,570
pick a random person like let's pick

00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:28,060
mark Thomas so you can go and you can

00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:30,670
see that mark is a part of pivotal

00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:33,280
because it's been tacked by someone at

00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:35,890
the Apache as being part of pivotal that

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,820
means we can go in unofficially and say

00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:41,020
pivot Ville has contributed this much

00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:43,390
which is not true because there's smart

00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:46,210
comments contributing that's why it's

00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:48,520
not been shown and you can also see when

00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:52,060
he's first committed as you can see oops

00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:54,250
that's everything about Mark Thomas you

00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,980
can see he's been really active and he's

00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:59,380
solving a lot of tickets and he's mostly

00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:00,580
doing tommcatt and you can do that with

00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:06,310
all this three hundred and forty

00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:08,590
thousand people at the ASF so that's how

00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:10,840
we do it it's mostly automatic but

00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:13,090
there's a quite a bit of manual labor

00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,570
involved in it as well you got a

00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:15,570
question

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:24,010
yeah and we are almost finished

00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:26,859
supporting private brokers that you can

00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:30,099
install on your personal network and it

00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:33,250
will just push data to some server

00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:36,819
somewhere so it's still your still log

00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:38,740
in on snoot dot IO but it will be we

00:35:36,819 --> 00:35:41,460
won't have access to their the

00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:45,270
repository or anything just the

00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:52,780
aggregated data so that is possible yeah

00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:56,319
any other questions oh well what else

00:35:52,780 --> 00:36:04,059
can I do I can show you we have the

00:35:56,319 --> 00:36:05,440
latest thing we have is get up you can

00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:13,599
go in and you can see how many page

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:15,490
views let's just pick that one so we can

00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,490
see that people don't believe visit

00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:20,109
github in the weekends but we can also

00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:23,790
see that people are really interested in

00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:27,609
cloning or forking the Apache repose

00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:30,130
which is kind of cool we have this many

00:36:27,609 --> 00:36:32,440
clones I I did not expect it to be that

00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:34,690
big that difficult

00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:40,730
so notice seeing some cool stuff we can

00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:44,420
also see

00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:47,230
only it's got good good spell notes yeah

00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,230
that's why that's one

00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:55,650
this is the entire ASF bow notes so you

00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:59,640
can see the United States have

00:36:55,650 --> 00:37:01,950
downloaded 500,000 copies of a SS source

00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:04,550
code within the past three months or I

00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:08,790
think it's just two because we started

00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:11,250
capturing that two months ago and as you

00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:14,430
can see every single country except for

00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:16,290
oh yeah the Central African probably

00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:18,090
they don't have internet apparently or

00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:19,770
they don't pack the except so they

00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:21,360
haven't downloaded anything but every

00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:24,320
single of the country has downloaded

00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:28,560
from the a SS in the past two months

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:36,650
alakay I think is very awesome and can

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:36,650
even go in and say excuse me t

00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:46,730
yeah so you can see that brusha really

00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:52,400
likes HTTP because I'm Asian and China

00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:54,589
as well and so that is something going

00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:59,839
to can if your committer you get access

00:37:54,589 --> 00:38:03,470
to all of this so and my computer is

00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:06,260
dying now so I'll just finish this talk

00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:08,270
and thank you for attending and if you

00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:13,910
have any questions you can just poke me

00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:19,379
and I'll try to answer them so thank you

00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:19,379
