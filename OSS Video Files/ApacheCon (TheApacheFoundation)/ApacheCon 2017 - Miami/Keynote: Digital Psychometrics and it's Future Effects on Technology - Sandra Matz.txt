Description: 
	Keynote: Digital Psychometrics and it's Future Effects on Technology - Sandra Matz, Computational Social Scientist

The importance of digital psychometrics – that is the assessment of psychological characteristics via digital footprints – was highlighted recently in the context of Trump’s unexpected victory during the U.S. presidential election. According to international media reports, Trump’s campaign used detailed psychological profiles of 220 million US citizens to target them with more than 175,000 different versions of personalized ads that catered to their values and preferences. In line with the public debate around the effectiveness as well as broader implications of such predictive technologies, this talk focuses on the following three questions: (1) How does digital psychometrics work (2) What are the potential benefits and dangers of digital psychometrics? (3) And finally, what does the future of digital psychometrics hold and how will it affect technology?

well thank you very much for having me

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,120
here today and thank you all for coming

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,189
I know it's sunny outside so if that had

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,950
happened in England I can guarantee you

00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:14,160
no one would be here and for me is

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,630
really and now I'm a psychologist and by

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,460
training so the reason why I'm

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,680
interested in big data and the open

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,140
source movement is really because it can

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,240
tell us a lot about how people behave in

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,160
their everyday life and how that relates

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,410
to something like more stable

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,599
psychological traits that make people

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,520
uniquely themselves and so you can

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,800
already tell that my talk is going to be

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,450
a little different and to the targets

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,860
that you're probably going to hear over

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,840
the course of the day but I still hope

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,450
that you enjoy it and that you learned

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,289
something new about how data can relate

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:48,480
to something like psychology okay so now

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,770
I want to start and with the new stories

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,449
and I'm pretty sure that many of you

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,149
have come across in one way or another

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:56,070
and so that was a new story that was

00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:59,039
originally published in the Swiss news

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,840
outlet magazine and basically in a

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,600
nutshell what the author's claim is that

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,970
the Trump presidential campaign have

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,520
used detailed psychological profiles of

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,409
millions and millions of voters and in

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,110
the u.s. to target them with highly

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,270
personalized advertising and on Facebook

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,580
and the goal is not only to kind of

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,439
convince and Trump supporters to go out

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,409
and vote for Trump but also to kind of

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,450
discouraged and pillory voters to go out

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:28,229
on Election Day and put in their vote

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,790
and so I mean it's kind of questionable

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:31,619
whether that story is truly simply

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,840
because we don't have any data so it's

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,939
very not open-source and in that sense

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,340
and but it clearly producible

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,990
psychometrics and in the spot line and

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,270
it's kind of now known around the world

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,149
and that's why I want you to talk about

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,340
what is digital psychometric how does it

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,899
work and what could be the benefits but

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,000
also like the challenges that we

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,799
experience but it's now being able to

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,210
predict someone's kind of highly

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,930
intimate psychological characteristics

00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:00,659
from the online behavior okay so

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,369
psychometric really means that we're

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,930
trying to assess them with psychological

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,810
traits something like their personality

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,879
their IQ their life satisfaction and the

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,709
way that we did that traditionally was

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,150
that we use questionnaire measures so we

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,780
would give people a questionnaire that

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,069
says I

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,080
talk to a lot of different people that

00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:19,140
parties and now tell us how much you

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,730
agree with that statement and what we

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,610
were really getting at is basically

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,550
people self perception so they told us

00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,080
about how they saw themselves and you

00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,120
can I mean it's quite obvious that

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,530
that's a bit problematic for various

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,290
reasons and I just want to kind of

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:37,020
briefly talk about you the first one is

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,940
that well people lie and so especially

00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,190
if there's a lot of stake at stake when

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,870
you kind of apply to a job I doubt that

00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,540
many people would say that they strongly

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,760
agree to the statement I make mess of

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,190
things it's very very easy to kind of

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,600
misrepresent on these questionnaires and

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,090
then the second problem is that it's

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,680
very difficult to scale so it's kind of

00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,310
completing one of these tests takes

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,050
between five minutes up to an hour so we

00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,940
can like as researchers we can easily

00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,950
invite people to the laboratory or have

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,350
them complete the questionnaire maybe do

00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,730
that for like 20 50 people but if you

00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,530
want to do that for millions and

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,930
millions of people then it gets a bit

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,730
problematic

00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,900
now what digital's like a metrics and

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,390
this is something that's only been

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,790
around for eons maybe like the last five

00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:22,709
years so what we're trying to do is to

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,299
kind of get away from giving people

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:26,640
questionnaires and asking them about

00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:28,980
their self-perception but we're trying

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,320
to look at what people actually do out

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,150
there in the real world so kind of which

00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,670
websites do they visit what's today's

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,950
you know social media profile and what

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,810
do they spend what kind of stuff do they

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,820
buy with their credit cards or even just

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,359
what is their phone recording in terms

00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:48,989
of geolocation and physical activities

00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:51,180
and we know from research and that we

00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:53,070
can actually successfully predict them

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,930
with psychological trades from something

00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,269
like personal websites some tweets

00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:00,359
Facebook like status updates and profile

00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:01,920
pictures and in a way it's not very

00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:04,290
surprising because everything that you

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,970
do out there basically tells us a lot

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,769
about your personal preferences your

00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,799
habits what you doing at your everyday

00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:12,780
life and how that then translates into

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,630
something like more stable psychological

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,030
traits and I just want to give you an

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,310
example for that apply magic saws is an

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:22,320
API and that we developed at the

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:25,540
psychometric Center and is based on the

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,550
models that we developed named basically

00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,320
and we came up with a name because

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,700
people asked them to how do you how do

00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,130
you make these predictions and we're

00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,990
like got a bit sick of it so really God

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,160
you just take data your private of magic

00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,680
sauce and then you have the

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,680
psychological profile so that's how we

00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,390
came to that name and I just want to

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,270
show you how it works so how can we get

00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:48,220
how can you use it because it's free

00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,630
online everybody can use it so how can

00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:55,150
you get from something like Facebook

00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:56,740
likes to like a psychological profile so

00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:00,160
basically what happens if you go and

00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:02,440
apply magic sauce come and you can click

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,030
on predict my profile so that's open to

00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,910
everybody it's absolutely free of charge

00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:08,980
and then you can donate different types

00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,870
of data so you can donate your Facebook

00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,790
profile you can donate your twitter data

00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,660
if you click here on connect with

00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,920
Facebook and this is my profile now I'm

00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,230
already logged in so I didn't have to

00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,300
put in my login details and so you can

00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,880
see it's connected to Facebook if you

00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,130
click on make a prediction basically in

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,900
a few seconds it's great your Facebook

00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,880
profile takes your life takes your

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,310
status updates and turns it into a

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,080
psychological profile so you can do that

00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,240
from all the sources that you have or

00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,450
the individual ones and that are

00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,190
available in your kind of profile so you

00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,230
can see it predicts stuff like gender

00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:47,410
it's pretty close and for me and that

00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:49,510
one and H mean psychological gender

00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:52,150
somewhere in the middle excite

00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:54,070
personality trade so this one in that

00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,530
case my facebook suggest that I'm kind

00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:59,080
of liver on artistic and a bit more

00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:01,120
introverted and a bit more laid-back and

00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,160
the end and the average so all of you

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,110
can do that if you just click on apply

00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,900
magic sauce to give your description of

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,850
what your profile means and in terms of

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,460
your psychology also predict

00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:16,660
intelligence a bit above average that's

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:18,850
promising life satisfaction is lower not

00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,650
so surprising working as an academics

00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,270
and it kind of basically predicts a

00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,920
whole bunch of other stuff so check it

00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,630
out and really that just takes a few

00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,630
seconds so you don't have to sit down

00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:30,130
complete like and question is for half

00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,230
an hour but really just login with

00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,610
Facebook and then you get at least the

00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:37,180
rough idea of what your psychological

00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:39,020
profile looks like ok so the question is

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:42,320
how does that work so what's behind

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,850
and our prediction mm engine apply magic

00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,970
sauce but also other prediction engine

00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:49,510
so there's IBM social letters and pretty

00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:52,460
much and similar predictions and

00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:55,010
predictions so it all started and within

00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:57,200
my personality Facebook app so my

00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,820
personality was set up by one of my

00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,820
colleagues in Cambridge who didn't have

00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:04,340
anything to do during his summer in 2007

00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:06,500
so he set up his app and that allowed

00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,970
people to take real psychometric tests

00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,650
so they could kind of complete a

00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:12,200
personality questionnaire IQ

00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:14,150
questionnaire life satisfaction and they

00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,800
got immediate every sponsors on there

00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,600
and they get immediate feedback on their

00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,620
responses so they completed a

00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,290
questionnaire and right there with

00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,480
feedback and on their personality or

00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:25,220
whatever they had completed now when he

00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,200
did that he actually wanted to collect

00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,780
data of maybe a thousand people maybe

00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,270
some of his friends and the people loved

00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,580
the feedback so much that they shared it

00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,260
on Facebook and and he ended up

00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,750
collecting a dataset of seven million

00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,550
people completely free of charge simply

00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,020
because people really like to learn

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,300
about themselves and they like to know

00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,430
themselves and so what we have now is

00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,410
since database that has psychometric

00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:50,990
test responses on something like

00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:53,990
personality values life satisfaction of

00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:56,480
around 7 million and Facebook users

00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,310
around the world now what's amazing

00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,710
about this dataset for people who are

00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:02,780
interested in data is that at the end of

00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,700
the like all said people have received

00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,440
feedback they were asked whether they

00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,570
would voluntarily share their Facebook

00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,450
profile information with us and for

00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:14,030
research purposes and about 50% of

00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,890
people there so so for about three and a

00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:18,020
half million users we actually have

00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:20,210
their self-perception in terms of

00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,310
psychological characteristics and we

00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,230
also have their Facebook profile data so

00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,640
we know what they like on face through

00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:28,010
what they post and Facebook we have

00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,860
access to their profile and pictures and

00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:32,720
basically their public profile and now

00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,150
this isn't like this is the interesting

00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,280
part and I'm not going to go into into

00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,600
details too because I'm sure that pretty

00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,450
much all of you know more about that

00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,400
than I do but basically once you have

00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:45,220
this behavior on the one hand and you

00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,360
have someone psychological and

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,160
characteristics on the other hand you

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,690
can start building models right for

00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,690
whether it's a simple linear regression

00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,910
it gets more complex and into neural

00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,680
networks or something and basically you

00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,320
can kind of try and take someone's

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,540
behavior and predict their psychological

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,450
profile without them having to complete

00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:07,160
a questionnaire and like if you want to

00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,480
know more about that the models feel

00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,580
free to kind of come and see me

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,080
afterwards but what I want to do is

00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,910
basically show you some of the

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,850
relationships that we found in the data

00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:18,590
that really show and it's very obvious

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:20,720
and how people have different

00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:28,040
personalities differ in the way that

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:30,770
they behave online okay so this is and a

00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,420
word cloud and of the words and stages

00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,340
updates that are most strongly

00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,830
correlated with a personality trait of

00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,660
extraversion so extroverted people are

00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:40,010
those who kind of love to be social they

00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,860
love to hang out with others you're

00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:45,680
optimistic and piercings and you can see

00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:48,710
that in the words right so extroverts

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,990
and talk about parties amazing love week

00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:54,080
and tonight and so they seem to be

00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:56,150
having a pretty good time if you compare

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,720
that to the introverted words house

00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:02,330
which I think most of us probably

00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,400
somewhere in the introverted M cloud

00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,030
year you can see that it's very

00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,090
different

00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:10,730
so introversion associated with talking

00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:14,150
about computers enemy internet reading

00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:16,070
books and and this is like on a very

00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,720
basic level this is just counting words

00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,220
right so you don't need any rocket

00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,290
science you don't need any complex

00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,240
machine learning algorithms to see that

00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:24,860
there's something in the way that people

00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,430
behave online that's related to their

00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:30,770
personality now gets even better and so

00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:32,060
this one so high agreeableness is one of

00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,430
the personality traits that

00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,350
distinguishes between people will care a

00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,960
lot about their social relationships for

00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:41,990
trusting we're empathetic and kind of

00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,670
warm and welcoming to those people again

00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,890
this is like it's kind of stereotypical

00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:48,290
but it also this is what we find under

00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:51,200
data so they talk about family wonderful

00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:54,350
amazing and beautiful and happy that it

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,350
is very grateful in general and now word

00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:59,150
of warning and the word hard for the low

00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,920
agreeableness which is basically people

00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:05,290
who are more competitive and more

00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,290
critical it's very very different

00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:12,970
and again this is nothing that we came

00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:14,990
up with this is what you see in the data

00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,240
so those are the words that are most

00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,760
strongly current and I'm not going to go

00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,920
through all of them them and this is the

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,199
pleasure of that but you can see again

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,120
it's very obvious how different

00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:29,089
personalities relate you to online

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,279
behavior you can do the same thing for

00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:34,250
life so just as an example again

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,500
introversion extroversion success like

00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,630
introverts again talking about computer

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,940
seems to be a big common theme here so

00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:42,829
final fantasy Battlestar Galactica and

00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,320
extraversion those are people who hang

00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:46,639
out and love to be around other people

00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,860
so they like to meet new people

00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:52,220
socializing parties so just just are

00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,660
just official Facebook pages so it's not

00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,029
if one of your friends posts the cat

00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:58,190
video and you're like yeah I like that

00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:03,529
for those are just official pages so in

00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:05,389
terms of like I don't know BBC or CNN ok

00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:07,360
the latest development which i think is

00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:09,199
extremely interesting is that you can do

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,140
predictions of someone's personality

00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:14,540
simply based on spaces so the profile

00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:16,970
pictures that we have available on on

00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,920
our hour of my personality database and

00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:21,529
we're used to kind of make predictions

00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,440
from faces of someone's personality and

00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:26,510
this is basically just the AI dreaming

00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,250
of faces of introverts and extroverts so

00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:30,529
those are the faces that the computer

00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:33,019
predicted to be most introverted and

00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:34,820
extroverted and again you can see very

00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:37,670
obvious differences that make a lot of

00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,380
sense for the introverts of glasses look

00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:41,899
a bit more shy and reserved with the

00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,760
extroverts probably have the headline

00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:45,800
because it's like much more blonde and

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,959
then the picture of the introverted ones

00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,500
and also maybe wear contact lenses

00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:55,279
because they have like blue eyes with em

00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:56,959
introverts have brown eyes so again like

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,180
whatever kind of digital footprint you

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,149
take is a pretty good chance that is in

00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:05,000
some way related to something like

00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:06,709
psychology personality intelligence okay

00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,019
now the question is how accurate is it

00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:12,170
and then I don't kind of I don't want to

00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:14,329
go into too much detail but the the way

00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:16,279
that we usually assess the accuracy of a

00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:17,450
prediction model is we compare the

00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:19,190
computer based project

00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:21,530
to the self perception of the

00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:23,180
participant and when you kind of look

00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:24,920
across different personality trades

00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:27,860
different footprints the accuracy is

00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:31,400
usually around the correlation of 0.5 or

00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:33,590
0.6 now the thing is at point five point

00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,180
six is that good is that bad and it's

00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,590
really difficult to say so what my

00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,810
colleagues did and I think this is

00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:41,870
actually a very nice way of illustrating

00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:43,460
the power and computer algorithms is

00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:45,650
they compared it to the judgments of

00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:47,780
people in our environment so how good

00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:50,000
our colleagues or friends or family

00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:52,610
members or partners are judging our

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,920
personality in comparison to how good

00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:57,980
the computer is and what this so this is

00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:00,080
just the example for Facebook life so

00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,030
the computer needs around 10 Facebook

00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,120
pages to be better than someone's work

00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:08,810
colleagues it's about 65 pages to be

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,730
better than someone's friend about 120

00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:13,760
to be better than someone family member

00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:16,310
and around 250 to be better than

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,080
someone's spouse and now the average

00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:21,560
number of likes at the time we conducted

00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:24,230
the study was 213 so the computer is

00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,120
basically better than everybody except

00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:29,900
kind of a little bit worse than our

00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,820
partner spouse which is for me basically

00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,800
insane because the computer only has the

00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,360
Facebook Likes right and usually you

00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,770
spend a lot of time with your friends a

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,990
lot of time with your family and your

00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:41,090
partner so they should technically have

00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:43,640
a very good idea and with who you are as

00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:45,650
a person yet the computer is pretty much

00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,920
has pretty much the same accuracy just

00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:51,500
by looking at your Facebook Likes okay

00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,020
so now how can we use like these

00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,520
insights digital psychometrics and in

00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,710
action so what can what are the

00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,480
applications and of being able to

00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:02,030
predict someone psychological profile

00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,830
and the main message is really that I

00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:06,050
think it helps us to kind of personalize

00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:08,000
services across the whole board so we

00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:10,100
can use it for targeted marketing and

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,920
healthcare and education because the

00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,630
more we know and about the person about

00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,820
their personal needs and preferences the

00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:18,950
better we'll be able and to tailor the

00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,860
services that we offer and to those

00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:24,470
preferences okay so I just want to go

00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,480
very briefly to the first two to give

00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:29,630
you an idea of how I see digital

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,149
psychometrics working out em in practice

00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,889
so what we did are like the question

00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:35,810
that we were interested in is can we use

00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:37,550
and knowledge of someone's psychological

00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:40,100
characteristics to increase the

00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:42,230
effectiveness of digital marketing so

00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,060
that's going back to the to the Trump

00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,949
story where they kind of try to target

00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,600
people based on their personality and

00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:49,970
really kind of increase the

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,740
persuasiveness of their messaging simply

00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:55,009
by taking these characteristics into

00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:57,110
account and we didn't advertise well we

00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:59,389
didn't promote Trump and we promoted

00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:02,300
something that's quite far away and an

00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:04,240
online duty retailer in the UK and then

00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,889
what we did is we simply came up and

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,839
with a few extroverted messages and a

00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:10,759
few introverted messages so you can see

00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:12,259
the extroverted messages there's always

00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:14,600
something going on people were kind of

00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:16,459
having a good time together and in

00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,389
introversive as it was like usually one

00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:22,490
person in a quiet setting now what we

00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:24,709
did is we ran actual Facebook campaigns

00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:26,329
and over the course of seven days where

00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:28,850
we targeted introverted extroverted

00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:31,279
users with these different types of

00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,959
messages over the course of the seven

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,610
days we attracted about six million

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,410
impressions so that's the number of

00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:38,930
times the ad was shown and Facebook

00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:40,910
around 10,000 clicks and about 400

00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:43,670
purchases on the beauty retailers and

00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:46,339
web site I just want to give you two

00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:48,649
metrics so basically what we saw is that

00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:50,259
when you match the message that you use

00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:53,209
to promote a product to people

00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:55,069
psychological effect eristic we see high

00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:57,439
conversion rates for people purchase

00:16:55,069 --> 00:17:00,319
more often and they also generate more

00:16:57,439 --> 00:17:02,300
revenue and for the company and this is

00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,860
really simple right so it's exactly the

00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,419
same product the only thing that we're

00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,610
changing is actually the way that we

00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:09,949
communicate and with people based on

00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,720
their psychological profiles now you can

00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:13,640
do that to kind of promote consumer

00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,470
products you could do the same thing in

00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,980
the context of political campaigns in

00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:21,380
the context of healthcare ok the second

00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,299
and topic that I think is extremely

00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:26,030
interesting and extremely important

00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:28,580
these days and is healthcare and just

00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:31,820
one example is that we can now predict

00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:34,159
and whether someone is likely to come to

00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,650
develop a depression simply by looking

00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:38,870
at their smartphone so if we take into

00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,610
account and their activity in terms of

00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,539
where they are how much physical

00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:43,639
activity their

00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:45,979
is and how much they sleep how much to

00:17:43,639 --> 00:17:47,749
interact with other people also that's

00:17:45,979 --> 00:17:49,609
kind of passively collected on your

00:17:47,749 --> 00:17:52,669
phone while you carry it around pretty

00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:54,590
much 24 hours M a day can tell us

00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:55,970
whether or not you're more likely than

00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:58,669
the average person to develop a

00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:01,609
depression and if you think about that

00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:03,200
the people who develop a depression are

00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:05,210
usually not the ones who would go out

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,039
and seek help that is actually really

00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,749
useful because we can actively help

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:12,529
those people who are in a vulnerable

00:18:08,749 --> 00:18:14,389
situation and this was a new story that

00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:15,979
I think is extremely interesting and

00:18:14,389 --> 00:18:18,499
it's very nicely for me kind of shows

00:18:15,979 --> 00:18:21,080
both the positive like potential but

00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:23,649
also the dangers for abuse and which is

00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:28,039
like Facebook and with being accused of

00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:31,249
doing research on the prestine so people

00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:34,519
like teens experiencing and anxiety or

00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:37,460
stress and then being basically being

00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:39,679
exploited for targeting now if you think

00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,399
about it this is actually an amazing

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,470
chance

00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:45,259
so if Facebook is doing research trying

00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:47,179
to identify people who are at risk well

00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:49,429
if that information was being used to

00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:51,289
kind of help those those teenagers who

00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:52,580
are probably not going to go and see

00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:54,769
their parents because they are having a

00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,479
bad time then on the one hand that's an

00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:58,940
amazing opportunity that could actually

00:18:56,479 --> 00:19:00,919
be used to help those and teenagers but

00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,409
obviously it also has the whole other

00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:05,960
dark side where knowing it's like having

00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:08,509
information and on something like that

00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:11,330
could be abuse to exploit weaknesses and

00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:13,700
people's characters it's like for me is

00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:16,129
really when I wrote this new story I was

00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,259
like look obviously there is potential

00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:19,849
for abuse but don't kind of say that

00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:21,200
it's bad in general because it's the

00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:23,269
technology and if we can help those

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,879
people the benefits that we could reap

00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:28,179
would be like basically equaling out the

00:19:25,879 --> 00:19:30,889
potential dangers in my point of view

00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:34,159
okay so now they look into the future of

00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:35,599
digital psychometrics and as all of you

00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:38,869
know there's basically more and more

00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:40,340
data collected on us every second so I

00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:42,529
think the future is really kind of

00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:44,269
taking people's more stable

00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:45,979
psychological trades that we can get

00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:48,169
from something like Facebook profiles

00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:50,720
the websites that people visit but then

00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:51,650
combining it and with information about

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,630
the context that the

00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:56,150
person isn't so kind of really looking

00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:57,620
at the person as in real-time so what is

00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,330
that okay where you know that this

00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:01,100
person is extroverted what what is he

00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:03,500
doing right now is in an extroverted

00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,880
situation in a good mood and what does

00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,420
that tell us about how we should

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,860
communicate with that person how may be

00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:12,320
prone he is to kind of showing a certain

00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:14,930
type of behavior and the person that I

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,300
think has very nicely expressed widest

00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:19,460
is I'm so important is one of my

00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:24,100
favorite comedians Lucy Kay and I'll

00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:24,100
just let him give you give you the spiel

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,830
just the constant nobody takes in life

00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:32,540
unless it comes through this yes like

00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,370
whenever I see a televised event that's

00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:38,120
a huge like the Olympics Opening

00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:40,400
Ceremony or a Time Square at midnight on

00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,780
New Year's Eve everybody they see seeds

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,680
of people all looking at it through

00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:47,480
their phone like there's explosions in

00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,840
Acrobat but they're looking at it

00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:53,750
through a little screen screen like I

00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,310
think if Jesus comes back and starts

00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,840
telling everyone everything

00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:59,360
it'll just everybody just going to be

00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,310
twittering and they won't really I am

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:06,500
Christ that I have returned oh my god

00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:08,630
Jesus is right in front of me as I think

00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,460
you very nicely summarizes the fact that

00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:12,220
most of our life and our mediated by

00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,120
these digital devices or whether it's

00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,770
communicating with our friends or just

00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,260
capturing the moments that are most

00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:20,300
important to us most of it is recorded

00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:22,400
by like our smartphone by variable

00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,740
devices and this is only going to get

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,110
more and I think it's on the one hand

00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,690
and this is actually also my my

00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:31,850
conclusion I mean on the one hand it's

00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:34,100
extremely exciting that we know so much

00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:36,050
about people's life now but also with

00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:39,020
that great power that we have comes a

00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:40,220
great responsibility and and I really

00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:42,950
mean that because I think for a lot of

00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:44,780
people is extremely scary because they

00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:46,220
don't know what's happening they don't

00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:48,380
know how stuff works they don't know

00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:51,080
what's actually possible and I think

00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:53,060
it's true for what all of us in the room

00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,430
but certainly also people in academia is

00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:57,410
that we get need to get a lot better at

00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:58,970
openly communicating and transparently

00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:00,860
communicating first of all what's

00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:03,140
possible and then also how the

00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,060
technologies that we develop are going

00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,130
to affect people

00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,870
life because what they hear at the

00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:09,700
moment is stories like the new story

00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:12,280
about Trump or the new story about

00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,750
Facebook how those technologies are kind

00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,670
of ruining their lives making them

00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:18,340
crunch and being manipulated and

00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:21,100
basically posing a huge threat to their

00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:23,140
life now I think what we need to do is

00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,910
basically show them the other side so

00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,470
show them that yes these technologies

00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,240
expects and we're working on them to

00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,860
kind of make them better but actually

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,390
there's so much potential for kind of

00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,490
helping you make better decisions

00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:35,350
helping you kind of lead healthier and

00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,850
happier lives and we're not doing that

00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,610
behind the scenes who are we actually

00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:41,380
openly communicating and to the public

00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:43,690
what's possible and what we're currently

00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,310
working on and I hope that we can all

00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,260
just do that together and I think

00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:49,000
obviously the open source movement and

00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,400
is one of the movements where we

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,820
conceded like at least going in the

00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:56,470
right direction and and this is is my

00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,210
vision for the future that is kind of

00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:00,280
people like you and me working together

00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:03,190
academia working together with industry

00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,460
and making that change happen well thank

00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:10,289
you very much

00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:10,289
