hello hello hello but we actually have

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:06,810
lot of light so we'll need that for

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,580
people to talk so we'll need to give

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,120
that to the speakers we do have we have

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:15,480
name tags - thank you rich Bowen

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,670
we'll need this later we have a props we

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,080
have the Apache con lightning talks are

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,880
a long long tradition of five minutes to

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,340
talk about whatever you want to talk

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:31,230
about that's something related to Apache

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,430
and your community or your technology

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,100
here oh really

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,590
still there Wow chief the voice of God

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,510
and then the figure comes in and the

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,430
beer comes in there and Jim's voice goes

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:45,420
up throw high because the beers in and

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:50,489
we have a really important rule no slide

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:54,210
no slides five minutes no sign new

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:56,370
slides no minimal heckling unless

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,530
Midwest shade is talking then you can

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:02,219
heckle as much no I thought - I'm the

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,439
practice speaker okay so okay I can't

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,960
wait for Richard sock and we do have one

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,450
exception with slide that there's a rich

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,820
Bowen rule where sometimes you just have

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,650
to have slides for the heartwarming and

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,840
interesting method so that is the one

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,390
except but no there's not yet yeah yeah

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,159
it's a beer and in a in the back booth

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:24,360
we just need a timer we don't need those

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,990
yet just the timer stops on glide just

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,869
the timer

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:31,500
I believe the beers are open and

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:33,869
available so yeah as we humming grains

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,790
like monkeys up here people start going

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:42,090
grabbing some beer that's very very good

00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:46,020
it helps everyone enjoy both Shane and I

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:50,070
immensely we become much funnier yeah

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,630
more you drink so I would suggest drink

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,430
heavily and and you should probably

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,350
start drinking before we do if that's

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,420
your kind of thing yes thank you

00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,820
oh why thank you we didn't even have to

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,740
ask we didn't even have to any Julian

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,060
that that that we need the timer but not

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,570
the slide yet thank you

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,259
and just a reminder that everyone who

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:13,230
does talk gets one of these fancy little

00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:16,170
capital one cable rolls if we have

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,239
left over I will be lobbing them into

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,980
the audience they do have little hard

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,950
things on there so they hit you don't

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,290
sue us but they will be kind and I would

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,739
like to another another beer another

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,349
beer

00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:30,959
yes well Jim since Finn's Capital One

00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:33,989
and Capital One is sponsoring the beers

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,000
you get two right I get two I can I do

00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:39,000
thank you have one so hopefully I'll be

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,410
funny or two after two beers uh so I

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,940
think we should we should get moving so

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,810
people can get going we should get

00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:47,549
started yes if David North is here

00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:51,060
David North is David North it's David

00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:55,319
McKenzie is and he has David has a great

00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:58,470
dirt I mean not that I'm biased but who

00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:00,530
even better so David we talking while

00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:03,420
we're we're getting our viewers about

00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,799
actually it's oddly appropriate for

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,519
getting beers because he wants to talk

00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:08,790
about beer

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,260
well let's go but after beer okay I owe

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,290
I owe three

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:16,799
apache HTTP D right Thank You Jimmy a

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:19,410
trio and our office shower whoo that

00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:22,049
sounds video five minutes for our first

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:33,660
speaker victim excuse me ah thank you

00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:35,489
very much hello Yeah right okay so I

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,010
want to talk about this which was a last

00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:40,319
sort of little fun side projects I did

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,269
but I was wondering where's the Apache

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,700
angle and then I realized but actually

00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:46,500
there is Apache Software at the heart of

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,389
this project but it works so well and

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,549
I've used it for so long that I've

00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:54,359
almost forgot that it was that it's that

00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:57,060
good so flashback about a month ago I

00:03:54,359 --> 00:04:00,090
work in an office with 70 other people

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,879
and as the weather gets warmer more and

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,709
more of us cycle to work and that's all

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,989
fine and good the problem is that we

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:08,549
only have one shower in our office

00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:11,220
building so if you've got ten people

00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:14,819
cycling to work in the morning it gets a

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,799
bit contention and and it was really

00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:19,049
boring standing outside waiting for the

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,970
shower to be ready and if I go and see

00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:23,039
that my desk and do work I keep finding

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,169
that I've missed my opportunity to get

00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:26,490
into the shower so what I wanted was

00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:28,440
some way of being able to tell

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:31,500
from the comfort of my desk that the

00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,789
shower was available so what I did was

00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,889
I've got a hold of a magnetic door

00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:36,840
sensor this is the IOT part of the

00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:38,819
project stuck that to the door and

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,490
people usually leave it open when

00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:45,270
they're done so so reliable but not 100%

00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:47,069
indicator this thing calls out when the

00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:49,740
door opens or closes over the Internet

00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:51,960
at the other end there's the Apache HTTP

00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:55,440
D server running a little CGI script

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:59,190
that does the updates so we get events

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,440
for door opened or closed and thanks to

00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,970
the magic of Apache it's really easy to

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,770
put a little hook there with the CGI to

00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,810
receive these events integrate with our

00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,819
office single sign-on system so that the

00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,590
crucial corporate data of whether you

00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:14,550
can use the shower or not is protected

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,990
by login and it all just works and so I

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,520
know I'm not allowed to have slides but

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,500
I would like to show you just to prove

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,789
that this is real you can see here

00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,979
because it's gone it's what is it

00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:28,139
yes it's five minutes to 11:00 in the UK

00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:30,000
so oddly enough the answer is yes the

00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:33,719
shower in our office is currently free

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,469
and the door has been open since 11

00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:39,419
minutes past to Florida fine

00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:41,849
so that was my most recent Internet of

00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:44,280
Things project and it has saved me many

00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:45,870
minutes every morning so it's all thanks

00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,199
to a bit of Apache software at the heart

00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,199
of things

00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:58,810
ethic I was a little worried when he

00:05:54,790 --> 00:06:00,670
says IOT and the office shower playing

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,430
in this surveillance or something well

00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:06,820
it is the Internet of Things yeah well I

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:09,730
guess I'm fence on but so Peggy I - that

00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:11,920
is so old-school I mean that is great

00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:15,010
I've been over it was Perl were you

00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:18,010
running Perl maybe uh-huh no it would

00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:20,170
have been even more more beautiful Dom

00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:22,420
it so glad they let it's a good notice -

00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,580
let's keep it clean with Fitz light so

00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,120
keep it fun keep I mean well during

00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,580
clean

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,220
sudsy keep it it sudsy will do good -

00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,410
you know like ah so we're not all fun

00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:37,930
and games no no we're not we are dead

00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:40,420
serious sometimes so so next we have mr.

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,340
Trevor grant yes mr. grant here please

00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:45,970
ah very good

00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:48,040
yes he is Wow I've impressed you've got

00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,150
your own your own our cheerleader cuts

00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,730
the Trevor grant would like to talk

00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:55,420
about Apache mahute out with the

00:06:51,730 --> 00:07:00,130
MapReduce and in with the GPU mmm very

00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:03,130
cool I joined yeah you can clap that's

00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:08,950
fine oh there we go there we go I'm

00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:10,990
started um Trevor grant I am by night a

00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:13,270
PMC on the Apache Mamu project and by

00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,640
day I'm actually paid to be an

00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:17,260
evangelist and open source which means I

00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,690
get to go around and just get people

00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:24,100
jazzed up about working on open source

00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:25,540
projects that I like um I usually when

00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,130
I'm doing this job don't take notes but

00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,350
I was kind of nervous coming up here and

00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:31,120
then thought I'd be cool and have a beer

00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:33,130
with me and then didn't think about what

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,740
I was doing and I have all my notes on

00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:39,490
my hand so I'm gonna have to wing this

00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:41,800
one a badging hoot has been around for a

00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:45,190
little while how many people heard a bit

00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,170
hands a lot keep those hands up if you

00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:50,710
think that Apache mahute is machine

00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:52,780
learning on that produce and there we go

00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:54,520
and that's the problem and why I want to

00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,250
go up here we have not done that with

00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,350
Devin deprecated since like 2014 and if

00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,480
you've been anywhere near me shared a

00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,040
table had someone shed some coffee the

00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,840
entire time I've been out here there's a

00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,590
good chance I'd cornered you and gave

00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,750
you the long

00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,100
version of this talk about how Apache

00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,650
mahute is doing all these exciting

00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,600
things or engine neutral we run on spark

00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:15,400
we run on flink we run on h2o you can

00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:19,810
write your own bindings we run things on

00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:21,850
H GPUs native solvers CPUs it is the

00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:25,630
coolest machine learning library you've

00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:28,090
ever been a part of but everyone thinks

00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,380
Oh Map Reduce because for every blog

00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,270
post that comes out about all the cool

00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,530
new stuff we're doing to more people

00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,030
right I've learned how to do

00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:36,280
recommenders on that producing the moon

00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,660
it's very hard to get people the word

00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,400
out and so that's what I want to be up

00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,990
your doing I want to if you take nothing

00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,960
away from Apache Con of all the cool

00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,800
talks you remember mahute is no longer

00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,480
MapReduce

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,850
we're on spark we're on all these cool

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,160
things we create huge GPU clusters it's

00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:53,200
great also an important thing to

00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,970
remember about the moon project not the

00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:01,120
most important thing but very important

00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:09,160
we've got the best swag koozies ooh very

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:18,340
nice three more minutes I can dive into

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:19,450
the stack why not so I've been saying

00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,040
some crazy things like we have

00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,440
distributed engines were engine native

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,060
how many people work on a project that's

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,640
like big data big distributed data

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:31,960
probably a few are interested in getting

00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:34,540
involved in something on any big data

00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:37,300
distributed data structure how we do

00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,680
that is we wrap it in a matrix whatever

00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,900
the native structure is for your engine

00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,670
and then someone who is a real expert in

00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:45,760
your engine thinks okay how do we do a

00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:48,010
matrix transpose what that lets you do

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,470
is we have a Scala DSL that sits on top

00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:53,860
and you can write in a very Python like

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:56,290
way in a very are like way matrix

00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:58,840
algebra now this is another problem that

00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:00,790
we run into because everyone likes

00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,640
machine learning to be this bag of

00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:05,680
algorithms this one minor with methods

00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,870
and I sent some hyper parameters and

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,760
then I fire it off and then magic

00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,720
happens and then everything comes back

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,180
and tada

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,040
and it's not like college Matt I don't

00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,930
feel like explained statistics or

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,270
anything it was just they went off into

00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,970
hyperspace machine learning happened and

00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:23,899
it was

00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:26,699
we don't have quite the big as big of a

00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:28,949
target audience because you have to go

00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:31,439
remember that terrible college linear

00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:33,629
algebra to really get the exciting

00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:36,149
usefulness of it but that's where all

00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:40,589
the magic happens because using Apache

00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:42,899
move you deploy well I would say you

00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:45,240
read it let's say you read a machine

00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:47,519
learning journal statistics artal coal

00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,589
on Monday morning you spend Monday

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,240
afternoon you thinking about the article

00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:54,449
kind of grok and understanding the

00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:59,339
algorithm Tuesday you sit down and write

00:10:54,449 --> 00:11:01,589
some a hoot Tuesday afternoon finish up

00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:04,079
some Docs maybe unit tests go into two's

00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:07,350
Wednesday morning Wednesday afternoon

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:11,360
you have a brand new just how about the

00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:13,589
presses two or three days ago algorithm

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,120
written in a distributed fashion if

00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:17,069
you've ever tried to write a distributed

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,019
machine learning algorithm it is a

00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:20,249
really really really big pain and that's

00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:23,610
really the exciting that's the fun

00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:26,579
punchline 38 seconds left I am able to

00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:29,069
read a couple of these Apache streams

00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:31,860
incubator project check it out the

00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:33,990
cruellest social data you've ever school

00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,920
of social data project and all of Apache

00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:39,000
if you want to hear more about mahute

00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,370
we're doing a birds of a feather talk

00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,110
coming up at five six thirty what are we

00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:48,019
on Eastern ok soon coming soon come out

00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:51,100
say me I really appreciate it

00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:54,440
thirteen eleven seconds left to clap

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,440
[Applause]

00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:01,340
thank you thank you I have to admit

00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:03,170
mahute has been really really on top of

00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,850
my mind I've really been you know

00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,620
thinking about getting much more

00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,660
involved with it so this is really

00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,330
really cool stuff besides that I just

00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,720
like the name marut that's a heck of a

00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,880
name

00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:17,300
perfect and perfect timing perfect time

00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:19,310
then yes so let's go so I just want to

00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,530
bring out one point is we also support

00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:23,210
those of us you know who don't choose to

00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:25,190
imbibe for whatever reason for whatever

00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,630
reasons you know if alcohol is not your

00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:29,570
thing I know the other half of us it's

00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:31,310
caffeine right so we go both ways this

00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:33,860
is the first I'll be honest this is the

00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:35,660
first real beer I've had in about five

00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,820
weeks I've been one of those low carb

00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,260
diets and so and this is most probably

00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:45,170
one of the hardest things I had to give

00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:46,400
up I was drinking Michelob Ultra oh well

00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:48,800
that's that's just burns right off

00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,410
whiskey just earns right off beers got

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,970
the cards not the whizbee so I didn't

00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:55,910
say this in the first drink I had in

00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:58,520
five weeks I just beer I had in five

00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:59,810
weeks big difference so but I think we

00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,950
should go back through a little

00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:03,500
old-school yes

00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:06,860
- why we're here at Apache Con and I

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,450
would love to welcome rich Bowen who

00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,670
would like to talk about why I love a

00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:11,150
patch gone or rather with a mr. of hacci

00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:18,950
gone

00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:21,500
so save that keep it all right I'm going

00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:22,760
to talk about why I love a patchy con

00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,200
it's kind of a tradition in these

00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,660
lightning talks to have somebody come up

00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:29,410
here and talk about why they love Apache

00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:32,330
or hate Apache or whatever

00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:36,550
Apache con is the high point of my year

00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:41,720
every year going back to March of 2000

00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:44,390
in in late 1999 ken core sent me email

00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,310
and said I should submit a talk to this

00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,900
new conference called Apache con and I

00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,270
said you're crazy I have nothing to talk

00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:54,470
about and submitted three talks and they

00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:57,380
were all accepted and so I found myself

00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:58,880
in Orlando standing on a stage in front

00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,890
of a few hundred people who thought I

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,800
knew what I was talking about and that

00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:06,200
was a great feeling so you know that's

00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,950
part of why I love Apache con I've made

00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,900
a career

00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:11,000
of playing that game and standing on

00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:13,360
stage and letting people believe I know

00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,690
what I'm talking about

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,130
this is the 28th Apache con since the

00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:22,130
creation of the Apache Software

00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:24,860
Foundation you might say 29 if you count

00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:26,660
the one that was before Apache was a

00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:30,530
foundation I don't count that because I

00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:32,840
didn't get to go in fact I've been to

00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:35,690
every Apache Con except for the one in

00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:38,080
sunshine Germany in 2012 and I will

00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:40,760
never forgive my manager first

00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:44,420
preventing me from going but I think

00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:46,130
that I hold the record for attending

00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:49,250
more Apache cons than anyone else I've

00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:51,260
been to 27 of them that's awesome I love

00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,700
being on stage I love having all you

00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,530
people look at me and think I know what

00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:58,160
I'm talking about that's part of why I

00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:59,660
love Apache con um but there are there

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,030
are many other reasons

00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,940
Apache con is where I come to see my

00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:09,680
oldest friends many of whom I met at

00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:11,870
Apache con and and I met several new

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,680
ones this week so this is why I love a

00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:16,430
fashio con

00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:19,160
I love Apache con because it shows me

00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:20,600
that I'm not alone working on this open

00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,930
source stuff I see all these other

00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,780
people and you know CS Lewis famously

00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:28,820
said I read to know that I'm not alone

00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,710
except that he didn't actually say that

00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,270
that's a quote from a movie what there

00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:36,110
was about him but we'll pretend that he

00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:38,420
said it I I loved Apache con because I

00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,830
loved Apache and Hawaiian shirts you'll

00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,480
notice that every one that's been up

00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:43,190
here so far has been wearing some kind

00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,220
of Hawaiian shirt and there's no mistake

00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:48,380
at here I've always enjoyed Shane's

00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,870
lightning talks and so I thought I would

00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:54,650
be Shane today

00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:58,030
I love Apache con because of the passion

00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:59,780
that I see in the people that attend

00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:03,380
several of us that have been doing

00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:04,760
Apache con forever start to wonder if

00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,220
we're the only ones that care about

00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,740
Apache anymore and then we come here and

00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:13,310
we see the amazing people working on

00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,840
amazing new projects people half our age

00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,670
that are still working on this

00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,460
open-source thing and that's really

00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:24,600
exciting to me

00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:26,910
by the the the sessions here range from

00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,400
the esoteric and philosophical to the

00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:31,830
deeply practical but at the heart of

00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:34,710
every one is this desire to solve real

00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:36,690
problems in the real world to scratch

00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:39,690
your own itch as the saying goes

00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:42,420
I love Apache con because of our

00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,920
sponsors talking to sponsors about why

00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,720
they're here at Apache con has the

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,840
effect of reefs entering us because it

00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:51,330
shows us that it's about solving real

00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:56,880
world in the real problems in the real

00:16:51,330 --> 00:17:00,660
world that making lives better and and I

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,280
spend yeah people people depend on

00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,770
Apache software because we have a

00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:07,020
reputation for our vendor-neutral high

00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:09,300
quality software and it's sustainable

00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,070
because of those esoteric philosophies

00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,420
that we cling to in the face of

00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:16,589
practical realities

00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:19,020
I love Apache con because it's part of

00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:21,660
how identify I identify myself I've

00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:24,630
spent my entire adult life working on

00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:26,820
Apache con so it's it's a real it's a

00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:29,520
part of identity my identity I sometimes

00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:31,380
refer to it as my life's work I've spent

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,100
hundreds of hours on it but I'm not the

00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:36,660
only one other people including our

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,210
amazing producers they're at the back of

00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:41,550
the room our numerous volunteers our

00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:44,520
tireless infrastructure contractors our

00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:47,070
beloved Melissa and our supportive board

00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:50,070
of directors Apache con is built on my

00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:52,140
sweat and tears but also on yours it's

00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:55,020
older than two of my kids and the other

00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,420
kid has grown up watching me go off to

00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:00,000
Apache con and knows that it's such an

00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:03,330
important part of my life the wall of my

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,520
office is covered with those 27 Apache

00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:07,440
Khan badges and all the people that

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,800
attend video calls with me say what's

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,420
that behind you on the wall so as we

00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,570
look forward to the next Apache con

00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:17,310
details coming very soon I hope we need

00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:19,710
to figure out what you want in Apache

00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:21,960
con and make it that Apache con is

00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:25,080
primarily about building community thank

you'll love it as much as I do but I

00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:39,640
don't think that's possible

00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:42,410
[Applause]

00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:46,400

speaker will be me now one we have one

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,470
two rules right - five minutes and

00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:44,450
what's the other rule no slides no

00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:47,510

this you didn't know we were

00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:02,000
disorganized and the other rule is Jim

00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:04,990
gets now off the stage we didn't know we

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,120
were disorganized either so absolutely

00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:11,660
so my lightning talk is why I love the

00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:14,060
ASF oh wait not target let me get my

00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:17,000
lightning talk is five things I never

00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:20,360
could have imagined doing by rich Bowen

00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,220
Oh scuse me fights anchor group no

00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,890
really me ha but I'm already up here to

00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:28,130
kick kicking off five things I never

00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,570
could imagine doing as growing up that I

00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:33,470
think are important for the community

00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:35,930
and our world that if you told me as a

00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:37,610
kid I would have I wouldn't even last

00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:39,410
view I just would have had a blank stare

00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:42,350
like I would do that

00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:43,470
I don't understand first one doing open

00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:46,440
source

00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:48,809
so we can all raise our hand if we use

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,269
one of these the first computer I

00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:52,679
actually hacked on yeah not not that

00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:54,779
ready first computer I hacked on with

00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:56,580
the trash 80 which I actually got my

00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:58,409
father sent back because it wasn't good

00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:01,019
enough and he actually got one of the

00:20:58,409 --> 00:21:03,090
first Apple 2 pluses ever made the story

00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:06,600
he tells he got it from Steve Jobs but I

00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:07,409
don't see that but I didn't actually get

00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,850
in decoding them

00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:10,259
I actually went off to become an

00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,120
engineer and then worked elsewhere in

00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:13,799
software and it wasn't until late in my

00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,990
career that actually came back to open

00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:18,570
source and I wasn't

00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:20,190
I didn't plan it I just ended up here my

00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:22,860
job ended up here I was interested in I

00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:25,139
asked questions I got involved so my

00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,759
message there is I could have imagined

00:21:25,139 --> 00:21:28,580
doing this but when you talk to an open

00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:32,700
source project ask the question and

00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:36,960
people will welcome you I didn't always

00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,950
have a great childhood and I don't

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,860
actually remember most of my childhood

00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:44,190
which is good and I could not have

00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:45,779
imagined having a child when I was

00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:48,149
growing up when I was in college after

00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:49,200
college I had convinced my friends I

00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:52,019
would never have children

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,379
and lo and behold I got my wife and

00:21:52,019 --> 00:22:00,269
things changed we have a daughter

00:21:54,379 --> 00:22:02,070
daughters rock band he's 12 and this is

00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:05,240
was huge thing for me most important

00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:08,309
thing in my life and the lesson here is

00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,600
we are all here as volunteers helping

00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:11,580
out with Apache Con helping out with the

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,669
project we have day job whatever we also

00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:16,350
have families and the family your family

00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:18,149
your friends those are more important

00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:19,559
than all the rest of it so we need to be

00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:21,600
patient with other people in our

00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:23,789
communities when they don't show up in a

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,029
project maybe they have real life to

00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:30,470
deal with and that's okay it's okay that

00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:33,360
we're not all on our Apache project 24/7

00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:36,389
so having a daughter who loves animals

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:40,649
who loves horse riding leads to other

00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:46,950
questions no you can't have a pony well

00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:52,460
I could not unimaginably unimaginable

00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:52,460
that we now own opponent

00:22:52,549 --> 00:23:00,960
so he is a Welsh Pony 13 hands hi his

00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:03,120
name is Quincy my daughter absolutely

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,309
loves him and the barn owner was going

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,190
to kick him out and said I don't want

00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:10,409
him so we bought him $4 and last weekend

00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:12,000
we actually had him trailered up to his

00:23:10,409 --> 00:23:15,720
new home where apparently he's actually

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,090
a lot happier so my daughter knows this

00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,159
is not a long-term proposition we're

00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:23,610
looking for a new home for him you want

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:26,640
a pony let me know but what's important

00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:30,240
here is it's not about getting the pony

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:33,929
it's about maintenance so we paid $1 for

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,640
the course pony scooting uh it's about

00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:38,669
maintenance it's a it's about $1,000 a

00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,559
month so feed and give it a house so

00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:42,179
this is lessons for project communities

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,950
is it's not about just getting the code

00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:46,049
out there it's getting the Doc's out

00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:49,470
there answering the questions fixing a

00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:50,820
bug it's helping new contributors be

00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:54,600
able to figure out what you have and

00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:56,370
then help you build the next thing so

00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,830
what I could never have imagined when I

00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:03,659
was a child or anywhere were before that

00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:06,630
is becoming a public speaker so this is

00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:08,460
a great photo by Julian Cash who's done

00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:10,590
a lot of high tech conferences who does

00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,840
painting with light but I've been doing

00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:15,510
Apache Khan speaking for years I've been

00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,820
doing it up on end Avenue nos kind of

00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:19,080
night which is an awesome kind of

00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,789
lightning talk thing I could never

00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,010
imagine doing that earlier in my career

00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:25,740
and it's still hard for me I still get

00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:29,789
nervous before top here the lesson here

00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:32,280
is just do it we all have a hard time

00:24:29,789 --> 00:24:34,169
getting up on stage and there are a lot

00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:37,919
of us who once you ask somebody else you

00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:40,620
realize they're 42 that helps you that

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,270
helps them too and then those of us who

00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:44,640
have been speaking we want to help you

00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:46,409
feel better see if you feel better

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,690
missions for conference we have a lot of

00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:51,990
knowledge in Apache we can bring do a

00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:52,710
lot more calm and I never could have

00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,570
imagined

00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:57,360
growing up with just my parents I'm the

00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:59,330
only child really not husband's uncles

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:03,720
anybody else I never could imagine

00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:04,679
becoming part of such a large family as

00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,440
rich says

00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:09,659
his oldest friends are here I don't just

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:15,960
think that he means his oldest friends

00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:18,929
are here as long as friends but this is

00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,879
from 2007 and I believe these are petty

00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:23,340
members in 2007 I believe I've had a

00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:25,649
meal with every one of them and with a

00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:27,600
number of people here and the family in

00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:30,509
the community is why Apache so

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,100
successful so thank you and pride of you

00:25:30,509 --> 00:25:39,749
thing you never could have imagined you

00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:43,379
do Wow

00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:45,149
very very nice congratulations to change

00:25:43,379 --> 00:25:46,369
Shane that was great that was really

00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:51,929
good very good

00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:53,580
um yeah we did look a lot better

00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:56,700
back there in the old days didn't we

00:25:53,580 --> 00:26:00,629
yeah yeah that's what happens with time

00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:03,029
it just so is Mel hearing yeah they're

00:26:00,629 --> 00:26:04,679
coming up um so we'll do a little

00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:06,990
serious talk we all you know whenever

00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:08,759
you can in wipe your tears up here it's

00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:11,220
like arms away now would like to talk

00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:13,619
about collective responsibility for

00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,570
open-source software rip so part of the

00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:17,159
model of foundations perhaps we're

00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:20,009
talking about giving you a better

00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:28,019
experience like you allowed me how that

00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:30,090
works so I feel like a bit of a

00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:32,009
corporate shill coming up here because I

00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:35,009
actually get paid to come to conferences

00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:38,249
but you know those are very emotional

00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:40,320
appeals from previous speakers and I

00:26:38,249 --> 00:26:43,139
think that it's something special about

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,990
Apache that elicits that kind of emotion

00:26:43,139 --> 00:26:49,139
right that being said you know when we

00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:52,019
talk about open source I think that

00:26:49,139 --> 00:26:53,490
there's certain responsibilities that we

00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:56,519
have that I think that as a community

00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:58,860
you guys are very much aware of so first

00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:00,899
of all I'm going to fall back to things

00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:04,169
that you guys talked about in your your

00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:06,809
Apache way with regards to hats I have

00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:08,940
different hats right now in here is the

00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:11,730
open source product manager for synopsis

00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:14,129
software integrity goop essentially you

00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:17,040
know synopsis is a very large company

00:27:14,129 --> 00:27:19,680
right but software especially

00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:23,880
IOT has kind of spurred them to this

00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,890
towards this innovation also I'm uh I'm

00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,170
the current administrator for something

00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:30,450
called Coverity scan so just as a show

00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:34,560
of hands who here is familiar with

00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:36,270
Coverity scan a few of you right and I

00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:40,620
think it's very much project dependent

00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:42,660
right so essentially since 2006 Coverity

00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:46,620
scan has been providing static analysis

00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:49,260
to open source projects it's continued

00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:51,150
up to today and we have roughly 4,300

00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,130
active open source projects in both

00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:55,620
nineteen thousand developers who have

00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:58,140
actually interacted with our system now

00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:02,100
the current Apache projects include

00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:05,460
hadoo cassandra tomcat httpd traffic

00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:07,320
server right knife i pig sparked storm

00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,630
so some of the larger projects are

00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:12,200
already aware of what we can potentially

00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:14,400
provide and what does that mean right

00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:17,040
essentially what we're doing is we're

00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:19,770
helping open source projects mature over

00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,050
time right and you know while we don't

00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:23,490
really get a lot of credit I'm assuming

00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:25,290
that the issues that are found are

00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:27,840
actually being remediated in these

00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:31,950
projects right and providing long term

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:34,050
stability for the end-users right now in

00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:38,160
a switch hats right I think that you

00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:40,020
know as an open source well as a

00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,730
beneficiary of open source right I

00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:44,310
really appreciate that you know all of

00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:45,750
this developer effort goes into what is

00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:51,510
essentially enterprise-grade

00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:53,760
software right and I think the Apache

00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:56,940
way and you know the number of

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,100
successful Apache projects is a

00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,830
realization of how transformative

00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:05,310
collective collaboration kandi when

00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:06,810
developing software right but at the

00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:10,260
same time I think we need to acknowledge

00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:11,960
the role of users who actually consume

00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,880
and rely on the software that we produce

00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:17,310
right so software is imperfect I think

00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,530
you know as a developer we don't write

00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:21,510
perfect code it's not a realistic

00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:23,400
assumption that we can actually do that

00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:25,560
right but I think this view the fact

00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:28,700
that you know software development is a

00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:31,940
largely human endeavor and we as humans

00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:34,850
par and perfect right so another aspect

00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:36,350
of modern you know software development

00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:38,690
is the increasing complexity of the

00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:40,250
software we develop so you know Linus is

00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:42,860
law which is essentially given enough

00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:45,530
eyeballs all bugs are shallow is

00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:47,240
challenged by some recent bugs and code

00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:50,480
that had the benefit of public scrutiny

00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:52,910
right so you know I think when you talk

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,970
about risk and open source right it's

00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:58,100
not the quality of the software is

00:29:54,970 --> 00:30:00,380
necessarily inferior right but you know

00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:04,280
we can test so far right Edgar

00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:06,140
Dijkstra's famous words our testing

00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:09,290
shows the presence not the absence of

00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:11,540
bugs and I think that you know that

00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:13,730
tells us that risk is inherent right

00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:16,010
regardless of the over quality of the

00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:20,150
software in the development practice of

00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:22,610
individual projects right so things we

00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:24,890
collectively rely on put us at risk and

00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:27,920
we can talk about you know heartbleed

00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:29,390
shellshock stage-fright all those things

00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:33,290
that you know we've probably at some

00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:36,230
point been affected by but essentially

00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:39,050
you know what we do when we actually

00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:41,780
talk about those incidences are things

00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:44,780
that you know they're vulnerabilities

00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:47,710
that we we only know about but they

00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:50,530
don't actually give us any indication

00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:54,290
with regards to preventing future

00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:57,740
exploitation so you know I only have 30

00:30:54,290 --> 00:31:00,080
seconds left here I think I put a little

00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:02,540
bit too much with regards to my content

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,990
but essentially what I like is that this

00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:08,710
idea of maturity being part of the SS

00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:11,120
incubator project and I would like to

00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:14,030
put a challenge out there or a call to

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,400
action to you know subscribe as many of

00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:19,520
these projects that have high visibility

00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,140
high impact right into scan because I

00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,710
think that you could benefit from it

00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:27,159
thank

00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:32,929
[Applause]

00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:36,649
thank you thank you this is for you an

00:31:32,929 --> 00:31:39,799
incredibly valid point you know open

00:31:36,649 --> 00:31:42,710
source really is the way that the world

00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:44,269
is eating software so as much as we can

00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:47,480
do to make sure that our code is is

00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:49,100
reliable as stable at secure as we hope

00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,149
and think it is let's take the

00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,009
opportunity to do that

00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:53,450
and that helps all of us because we're

00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:54,919
using a software as well as the rest of

00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:56,720
the world that's right and like a lot of

00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:58,340
other people who are using it so a lot

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,149
of people been using our software in the

00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:04,789
past the future no all around we go way

00:32:02,149 --> 00:32:07,460
in the past so maybe you have some ideas

00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:10,190
about how far way back yeah I don't know

00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:11,840
I do I I've got some ideas about that do

00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:14,690
I take it off that no is this a good

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,980
opportunity yeah okay I'll do that

00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:19,940
I'll do that I hopefully I'm not taking

00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:22,549
anybody spot no but thank you Jim how

00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:25,070
many people here are familiar with the

00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:27,980
wayback machine just raise your hand now

00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:30,980
how many are familiar with the origin of

00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:32,720
the wayback machine with mr. peabody and

00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,460
his voice sherman raise your hand

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,669
okay and I'm not even talking that

00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:41,710
terrible CGI movie I'm talking about the

00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:44,960
old school fractured fairy tales okay

00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:47,600
for the next four minutes or so I'm

00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:51,110
going to be mr. Peabody and you will all

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,730
be my boy Sherman okay I love history I

00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:55,669
really do I think it's very very

00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:58,129
important tradition it's also very very

00:32:55,669 --> 00:33:01,039
important to me because history

00:32:58,129 --> 00:33:04,970
tradition are what define and create a

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:07,370
community sometimes you codify that

00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:10,159
tradition and it becomes what we call

00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:14,299
policy but they're all very very

00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:17,659
important it used to a long time ago was

00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:19,490
a real comic book fanatic love them up

00:33:17,659 --> 00:33:22,490
until they started retconning everything

00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:25,159
like Hal Jordan was a bad you know Green

00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:27,500
Lantern and then you know Peter Parker

00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:29,350
was a clone and stuff like they forget

00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:33,080
it you know give the old school stuff

00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:35,600
but the thing is about comics is that

00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:40,130
you can know everything you need to know

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:44,370
about a superhero by their origin story

00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:45,240
okay Batman his parents got killed

00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,889
spoiler

00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,929
sorry about that if you didn't know okay

00:33:46,889 --> 00:33:51,899
but Wow

00:33:48,929 --> 00:33:54,720
that defines the character okay Peter

00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:57,059
Parker gets his powers a burglar runs

00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,059
away the burglar kills his uncle great

00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:02,880
power great responsibility Wow so an

00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:05,880
origin story provides so much detail

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,529
about things so I'm going to use the

00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:12,859
wayback machine and give you the origin

00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:15,540
story of Apache but 1994 1995 or so

00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:17,730
there is his web server called the NCSA

00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,829
web server a bunch of people were using

00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:22,859
very very popular most popular web

00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:27,050
server out there everybody was using it

00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:30,149
very very happily but doesn't a person

00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:32,849
who was responsible for creating it Rob

00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:34,800
McCool got a great opportunity to go off

00:34:32,849 --> 00:34:36,570
to Netscape it was right you know the

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,550
same people who were doing Netscape the

00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:42,720
serve you know the NCSA web server

00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:47,909
we're also doing mosaic they left we

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:50,159
were screwed we had businesses protocols

00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:55,490
all kinds of things dependent on a piece

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:58,650
of software that was now completely

00:34:55,490 --> 00:35:01,790
completely dead nobody was working with

00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:05,250
it not a single soul was working on it

00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:08,310
that's a terrible position to be thank

00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:11,040
goodness there were people with the

00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:14,060
right mix of skills and talents and

00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,980
capability to basically be able to

00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:20,700
retake off that community which is hard

00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:24,270
to do very very tough to do but we

00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:26,670
succeeded and that was the start of the

00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:28,859
Apache group because what kid became the

00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:31,500
Apache Software Foundation but the key

00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:35,099
takeaway from this is that we realize

00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:37,619
how painful it was to be dependent on a

00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:41,010
piece of software that could you just go

00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:43,410
in a second in a minute because there is

00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:45,510
no one around to maintain it and that's

00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:48,270
where our focus on community over code

00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:52,380
came from because as long as you have a

00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:53,410
fully engaged community behind it no one

00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,990
else

00:35:53,410 --> 00:36:00,670
we'll hopefully have to suffer from the

00:35:55,990 --> 00:36:03,910
pain and anguish that we had to back

00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:05,470
when the Apache group started so kudos

00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:05,980
for everyone for keeping the vision

00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:15,520
alive

00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:17,770
thank you and kudos to Jim for still

00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,390
being here god knows how many years

00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:22,050
later I'm not going to say that oh no no

00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:25,960
no kudos new Trudeau is required

00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:27,460
yep sympathies maybe would be good I'd

00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,010
appreciate some sympathies the know

00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:31,870
kudos please please we have done we have

00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:33,400
done a lot over the years and it has

00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:36,010
been a long journey and it's been not

00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:38,440
just not just a code to give away but

00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:39,520
the model yes definitely think of all

00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,110
the other open-source foundations that

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,950
are copying what we do essentially have

00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:46,600
the copycat cuz we can but we need to

00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:49,230
also spread open-source around the world

00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:52,180
you just spread it like Johnny Appleseed

00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:56,470
so we have someone on the pump

00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:59,400
open-source in China from at at Apache

00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:03,120
rocket MQ today in here

00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:05,710

00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:16,240
terrible well I mean we don't Lube it up

00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,680
what's going on you know in the open

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:23,830
source in Johnny it's really a huge

00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,870
aigoo you know system for open source

00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:27,550
really starting to pop up I mean if you

00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:29,290
look at some of the downloads of a

00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,850
patent software foundation projects

00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:32,770
Chinese those Charlie one of the biggest

00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:34,990
ones there is huge interest there's huge

00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:36,700
uptick it's about getting it organized

00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:38,920
and it's about trying to take some of

00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:41,380
that culture and see how you can explain

00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:43,180
the culture of sharing here with that

00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:45,970
kind of Health Fair in definitely kudos

00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:47,710
to to Alibaba and while way and we're

00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:49,920
helping to really push that effort

00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:52,270
inside of China I know there's a couple

00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:55,030
projects inside the ASF you know

00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:57,370
sponsored and donated by both so please

00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:59,050
find them out and be sure to contribute

00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:01,720
back to them and one of the fastest

00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:05,670
Apache projects ever Apache rocket MQ

00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:08,700
literally takes your messages on Rockets

00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:13,859
content of a rocket and so then in a MQ

00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:17,940
which is a magic Q yeah which makes them

00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:20,339
go like tachyons like really fast so you

00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:22,140
get it even before in st. which is

00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,579
really cool so that's how you get your

00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:26,240
messages when you can send them across

00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:28,890
with rocket then you see

00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,359
so if we don't have a technical talk

00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,069
here which is fine we have plenty of

00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:33,450
community talks here we have plenty o we

00:38:32,069 --> 00:38:35,609
do have community talks love of

00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:37,890
community talks here and I think the

00:38:35,609 --> 00:38:39,750
person knows who they are if I say the

00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:41,670
love of community eat loves community he

pleasure of meeting my name is Daniel

00:39:18,299 --> 00:39:22,950
and one of the things that Jim pointed

00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:24,779
out actually in his talk just a few

00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:28,470
minutes ago is one of the tag lines we

00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:31,740
have at the ASF is community over code

00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:33,299
and he talked about the reasons why but

00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,279
the thing that I really love about

00:39:33,299 --> 00:39:38,880
Apache con I get to kind of come and

00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:41,579
talk with frankly the smartest people in

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,720
the world right I have a slight

00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:45,119
confession to make

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,500
I'm an infrastructure guy I've written

00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,750
code that's reached production in

00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:51,599
thirteen different languages though so

00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:54,809
I'm like a closeted developer and as

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:58,349
we're out on the floor I'm able to talk

00:39:54,809 --> 00:40:00,450
with folks and I'm learning that I'm not

00:39:58,349 --> 00:40:02,430
the only one that experiences the the

00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:03,839
highs and lows of writing code you guys

00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:08,340
know what I'm talking about right in

00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:10,740
like 15 minutes you're like oh yeah

00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:12,750
and then five minutes later like I'm so

00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:18,180
stupid I can't believe I did that

00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:20,730
right so I love it here because you know

00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:22,470
we we get to meet and hang out with a

00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:26,190
lot of folks that maybe we don't meet or

00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:28,290
see during our day job so what I would

00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:30,510
like you guys to do a little

00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:33,660
uncomfortable think about some things

00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:35,730
about yourself and we're going to talk

00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:39,000
with someone that you haven't met yet

00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:40,470
look around pick someone out I don't

00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,350
know that guy or I don't know that guy

00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:45,870
and figure out what you're going to tell

00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:48,420
that person so to kind of get the juices

00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:50,940
flowing I always do this and come up

00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:52,470
with a few things about myself so here's

00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:54,450
how you may want to go ahead and

00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:56,370
approach the conversation and I'm going

00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:58,320
to give back whatever time is left so we

00:40:56,370 --> 00:41:01,950
can all kind of meet each other that we

00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:04,620
haven't met yet so hi my name is Daniel

00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:12,260
open-source software development at a

00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:15,570
local university thank you thank you and

00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:17,070

so let's switch it up and do a little

00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:13,730
bit of Technology with will about Apache

00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:17,300
agent that sounds like a TV show

00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:19,160
technology with will yes so will can

00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:23,390
come up I hope will years will be

00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:25,810
awfully weird one yes and his Faulk and

00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:30,890
I think it's going to be ng isn't it Oh

00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:32,450
totally edgy right edgy no and thank you

00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:35,120
thank you very much

00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:39,260
hi everyone I'm will I'm a committer for

00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:41,480
Apache engine and it kind of sounds like

00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:42,950
it's Apache committers anonymous up here

00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:46,880
like hi my name is will

00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:48,230
I'm a committer i one-time committed

00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,360
code without running all the tests I

00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:53,570
don't know but um

00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:57,140
so yeah I patch the edge n't and yet

00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:59,300
sort of a plug but um I'm going to paint

00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:01,850
a picture so let's say that a it's

00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:03,350
Monday a client comes to you and the

00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:06,140
client says I want you to do video

00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:08,180
analytics I want you to help detect

00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:10,070
faces in a video feed or something and

00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:13,640
you look ok as like it's a hard problem

00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:16,070
but um you use a spark to do the

00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:19,310
streaming use I guess AWS or open

00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:20,720
stacked like scale-out you do open CV to

00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:22,930
do the face detection and it's like

00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:26,630
working great you barely finish in time

00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:29,330
Congrats and then the next month you get

00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:32,390
a bill in the mail for seventy thousand

00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:36,020
dollars because you are sending raw

00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:37,400
video feed over a 4G connection to put

00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:39,470
that a different way seventy thousand

00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,270
dollars is about eight thousand seven

00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:45,980
hundred and fifty Chipotle burritos

00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:48,170
which is a lot so the point is there are

00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:49,970
a lot of streaming technologies out

00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:52,490
there but a lot of them are designed to

00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:54,770
run in a cluster so you wouldn't want to

00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:57,590
run spark on a phone or at least I

00:47:54,770 --> 00:48:00,440
haven't seen it you wouldn't want to you

00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:02,600
can like write a Kafka connect a what we

00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:04,460
call client on a phone I guess but um

00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,380
the point is there are a lot of

00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:09,290
operations which need to be run in a

00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:10,730
streaming manner on edge devices on

00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:14,840
things like phones on things like

00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:17,480
raspberry pies and by streaming I mean

00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:21,410
the way in which data is consumed from

00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:22,760
devices that might not turn off for

00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:24,890
example if you have like a temperature

00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:29,210
sensor that's looking at the the

00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:30,800
temperature of an engine and if the

00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:32,780
temperature goes too high then you like

00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,880
turn off the engine but the point is you

00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:37,040
can't wait until all the data is there

00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,470
because it doesn't turn off you have to

00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:41,210
consume it as it comes in so that's sort

00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:43,790
of the idea behind streaming and this

00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:46,910
needs to happen in a streaming framework

00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:50,240
at the edge and this is exactly how edge

00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:51,080
intitial it's in an IOT framework it's

00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,540
written in Java

00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:55,640
it runs on the JVM so it's supported on

00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:57,850
Android devices it runs on Raspberry Pi

00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:02,780
is really really anything that has a JVM

00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:04,010
and it does data streaming for example

00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,320
the kinds of applications you could

00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:05,970
write

00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:08,730
you could create a smart microphone

00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:11,250
something which only sends sound

00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:12,900
information when the decibel level goes

00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:15,480
high enough like when somebody talking

00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,800
on a microphone and you wouldn't want to

00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:19,560
send data otherwise because then you're

00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,790
just sending uninteresting information

00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,380
you're just you're paying for every

00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:24,720
kilobyte that you send over a network

00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:25,560
and you need to do streaming processing

00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,540
beforehand

00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:30,150
for example streaming processing could

00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:33,870
also be like windowing so if you need to

00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:36,120
last like three minutes of data and you

00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:39,050
need to do some operation on that pool

00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:41,940
of data if you wrote that yourself you'd

00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:44,700
it's a lot of boilerplate code that we

00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:46,890
aim to remove the developer from and in

00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:50,910
addition there are so many ways in which

00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:53,820
you can talk to a back-end from from an

00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:57,330
edge device for loose mqtt there's Kafka

00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:59,460
you could use WebSocket rest that like

00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:01,680
just raw sockets if you want to go that

00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:03,780
far so agent comes with a lot of

00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,490
connectors that you can use to to talk

00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:07,020
to your back-end so that's more

00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:12,030
boilerplate code that you don't have to

00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:13,500
write but um yeah I guess that's all I

00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:16,170
really wanted to say but check out edges

00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:21,620
it's a it's it's a cool incubating

00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:21,620
project and save the burritos yeah

00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:31,780
thank you edge devices I think are kind

00:50:29,349 --> 00:50:34,839
of edgy obvious you didn't get the pun

00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:38,109
I don't think if anyone got the pun

00:50:34,839 --> 00:50:40,630
so it's an aptly named device and I'm

00:50:38,109 --> 00:50:42,460
not going to say any pun about the name

00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:45,250
of there are you looking about he's

00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:46,420
allergic to puns makes him break out in

00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:51,640
hives

00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:53,470
so we well apparently for years we've

00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:56,170
been doing lightning talks

00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:58,510
I've been either helping or divyam yes

00:50:56,170 --> 00:51:00,490
yes and we often have to we used to have

00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:03,339
to go out and sort of beat people not

00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:06,510
not literally so literally literally we

00:51:03,339 --> 00:51:08,740
have to do that to get into submit and

00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:10,569
there are some people who are I've asked

00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:12,160
regularly for doing lightning talks and

00:51:10,569 --> 00:51:14,500
you know it either they can't do it or

00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,390
they're busy or this doesn't work that's

00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:20,530
okay but I would like to say I would

00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:21,369
like to welcome oh no what it's not not

00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:23,859
him

00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:26,829
yes he's not doing one is he well I gave

00:51:23,859 --> 00:51:30,339
him the title so oh my god no problem so

00:51:26,829 --> 00:51:32,470
I'd like all my cameras is historic day

00:51:30,339 --> 00:51:34,240
oh my goodness I can welcome Henry and

00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:38,050
Elle and the title of his lightning talk

00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:44,740
is Thank You Henry for finally doing a

00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:46,750
lightning talk yeah thank you saying so

00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:48,369
yes every 10 years the last 10 years or

00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:50,500
so James asked me can you do a lightning

00:51:48,369 --> 00:51:53,020
talk and my answer as always I haven't

00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:54,609
prepared anything I like to prepare

00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:56,710
things if I'm going to talk to more than

00:51:54,609 --> 00:52:00,369
two or three people and there's a bit

00:51:56,710 --> 00:52:02,680
more than two or three and I haven't

00:52:00,369 --> 00:52:05,069
prepared anything so I spent a few

00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:07,300
minutes if not noticing some bits down

00:52:05,069 --> 00:52:09,579
and I want to say that we're not going

00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:12,790
to look around when I look at you look

00:52:09,579 --> 00:52:19,810
at everyone here and you know what I see

00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:25,930
I see recruiters and I mean people who

00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:29,079
recruit stuff and if community is over

00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:32,380
code then community building is over

00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:36,819
coding then your job is not coding it is

00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:38,270
being a recruiter and by and large you

00:52:36,819 --> 00:52:42,200
suck at it

00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:45,920
okay when not I I'm a horrible recruiter

00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:47,900
we suck at recruiting and so my takeaway

00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:51,050
that I wanted to basically pass along

00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:52,970
was stop thinking of yourself as an open

00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:54,700
source coder you need to start thinking

00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:56,869
of yourself as an open source recruiter

00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:58,940
look at people who do recruiting for a

00:52:56,869 --> 00:53:01,130
living and say to yourself I don't want

00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:03,349
to do that I don't want to act like that

00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:05,630
I don't want to do that as my style but

00:53:03,349 --> 00:53:08,960
how should I be doing that how should I

00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:11,839
be going to a content of a contributor

00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,730
potential a community that's near me and

00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:16,369
lure them into becoming part of my

00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:18,320
project ask them what do you want to do

00:53:16,369 --> 00:53:21,109
with my project what changes would you

00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:23,359
be thinking of great come join my

00:53:21,109 --> 00:53:25,190
projects stop thinking of yourself as a

00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:26,750
coder a person who's sitting there and

00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:28,220
just churning out the next line of your

00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:29,839
project and start thinking of yourself

00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:31,730
as a person who's churning out the next

00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:33,680
committers on your project because

00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:37,839
without that your projects coming to the

00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,839
Attic thank you

00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:48,099
thank you well thank you Henry that was

00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:50,650
well worth the wait

00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:53,200
that was me well worth lately very very

00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:54,910
insightful really and really is the best

00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,920
lightning talk in the shortest amount of

00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:58,569
time I've heard because night usually we

00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:00,309
tend to you know BOTS tend to take a lot

00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:01,839
of time some like fun though your eye

00:54:00,309 --> 00:54:03,220
you know right you've got thrown off

00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:05,500
stage because I wouldn't stop talking

00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:07,420
that's right well I'd be this because we

00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:09,339
take pride in what we do you know we're

00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:11,650
not going off the cuff like that so

00:54:09,339 --> 00:54:14,680
that's that's what it is it's just that

00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:17,049
level of professionalism that we bring

00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,890
to this solemn event yeah of course is

00:54:17,049 --> 00:54:20,650
exactly what it is

00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:21,760
are you think what I really enjoy whoa

00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:24,970
cashew clusters

00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:27,670
I love cashew clusters they are the best

00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:30,329
kind of clusters of all I cannot imagine

00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:34,750
any kind of clusters that could possibly

00:54:30,329 --> 00:54:35,380
re regarder than cash iu clusters I dare

00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:37,930
you

00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:40,210
you suggest something that could be

00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:41,980
better than cashew clusters I mean

00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:45,190
you're going to dare somebody I'm very

00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:48,579
interested err double dare go ahead run

00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:51,430
we'll set try upon your premise because

00:54:48,579 --> 00:54:54,759
at here at Apache we have a better

00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:57,490
cluster solution no yes we have an

00:54:54,759 --> 00:55:00,130
entire stack of them all the way up in

00:54:57,490 --> 00:55:03,400
the cloud it's called our very own

00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:05,319
Apache cloud stack and we actually have

00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:07,000
somebody an expert who's going to tell

00:55:05,319 --> 00:55:08,920
really cool stuff about how clouds tax

00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,750
does out stuff and cluster management

00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:13,450
and all that kind of stuff if Stan is

00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:15,279
here going up I want to hear more yeah

00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:17,890
everybody does right right right yes

00:55:15,279 --> 00:55:20,349
cloud sac cloud sac is is of all those

00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:21,759
big things cloud sac is a project that

00:55:20,349 --> 00:55:23,109
has the code and the people in the

00:55:21,759 --> 00:55:24,279
deployment but doesn't have the

00:55:23,109 --> 00:55:27,130
marketing budget of some of the other

00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:31,390
people but better another every other

00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:33,869
that's going to change tonight let me

00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:33,869
correct something

00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:40,520
a patchy cloud SEC doesn't do clusters

00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:46,430
Apache has a project for that it's

00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:49,700
called mazes and what actually plugin

00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:52,280
was written for cloud tech lately by

00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:54,710
Shea blue company that I recently joined

00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:58,400
I'm not going to spend more slides on

00:55:54,710 --> 00:56:01,370
them now which is called container

00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:04,550
classes it's using Cuban ETS and the

00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:07,460
idea come from that that we need a more

00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:10,640
generic solution for all types of

00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:14,000
clusters not just containers but also

00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:19,370
what also maysa of course but also a

00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:22,180
dupe or Galera or set or maybe some Sdn

00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:25,520
kind of application or maybe your

00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:27,950
application that you define with five

00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:31,190
kinds of roles in a multi-tier

00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:34,610
environment and you can just define

00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:37,520
those roles in cloud sack and then start

00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:39,980
them up and okay oh this is not there

00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:41,960
but to start it there and there's a

00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:47,000
functional spec and I want feedback on

00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:49,580
that so this is kind of a question to

00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,820
all of you to go to the wiki to the C

00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:56,480
wiki and then find application cluster

00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:59,060
surface look at what's there and see

00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:02,120
whether your project needs something

00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:03,890
like that or whether it doesn't apply

00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:05,960
and you need something else and leave a

00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:09,350
comment there and then I'll look at it

00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:12,590
and then we're going to implement
