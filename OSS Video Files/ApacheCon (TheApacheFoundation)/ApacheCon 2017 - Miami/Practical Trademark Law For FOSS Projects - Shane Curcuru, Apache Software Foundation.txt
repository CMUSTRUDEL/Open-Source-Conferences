Description: 
	Practical Trademark Law For FOSS Projects - Shane Curcuru, Apache Software Foundation

Are you wondering how your company can profit from the wild success of the Hadoop brand? Is your community struggling to keep vendor marketing teams out of your project's governance? Do you need a lawyer before you can "trademark" something, or can you do it yourself? (Tip: you can do it yourself!) Shane is here to help explain trademark law in practical, everyday terms for FOSS projects and the companies that contribute to them. I can clear up many misconceptions, and give you the practical and actionable advice you need to help your company or community protect and improve your good name and reputation. Some simple steps in the community about presenting and treating trademarks are all it takes to get started. Similarly, corporations need to consider business values first, before bringing in the lawyers. Trademark education that makes sense.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,720
so we will get started with practical

00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,880
trademark law for open source projects

00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,440
this is a overview presentation that I

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,269
think is valuable both for business

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,240
people and people running their projects

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:17,910
as well as for Apache committers and PMC

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,350
members both sides are important and

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,529
there's a lot of misunderstanding in

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:26,160
this whole area and this is we have time

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:27,480
today given this place so if you do have

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,179
questions along the way I'd be happy to

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,920
take some as we go along this is a sort

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,440
of a higher level overview about how

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,660
brands and trademarks actually work not

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,010
necessarily as detailed in terms of what

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,750
we might want to Pachi projects to do

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,870
but that's what I'm here for to explore

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,520
help explain so I am my name is Shane

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,920
Kirk crew I serve as the vice president

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,559
of brand management for the whole of the

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,690
AFF so that setting the branding and

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,110
trademark policies for all hundred and

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,030
eighty-one

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,370
projects of ours including paddling's

00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:00,000
and other things and I've been involved

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:02,730
at Apache since 1999 and I am NOT a

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,229
lawyer so I don't actually have to say

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,090
that this is not legal advice because I

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,299
couldn't give you legal advice not being

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,310
a lawyer if you do have questions we

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,430
have a privately archived mailing list

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,810
called trademarks at Apache org so

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,720
anytime you have a question that's the

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:21,270
place to ask and I along with some other

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,090
Apache members will read and answer

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:27,689
questions there so what are we gonna

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,400
talk about today there's a lot of

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:32,729
misunderstanding about how trademark law

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,490
actually intersects with the real life

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:38,549
of software products especially

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,189
open-source software products so let's

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,570
work on defining the terms around

00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:44,729
trademark law which is what lawyers

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,920
would think of with how they actually

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,509
work in real life with open-source with

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,380
license software that we all share and

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,369
use and so on so some of these I'm going

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,570
to run through a couple years pretty

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:56,310
quickly because I think it's going to be

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,229
pretty obvious to everybody here at

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,659
Apache con what this means but

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,280
open-source runs the world so in another

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,049
conference I actually had to ask do you

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,960
use open source in the organization you

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:11,310
know do you contribute to build on top

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,080
of whatever yes you do and everybody who

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,890
comes to Apache con that's part of what

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,930
your business

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:20,310
we use but what's important here is that

00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,810
when it comes to branding and trademarks

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,760
and the way a project behaves

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,580
open-source projects work differently

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,230
than corporate projects tend to we have

00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,660
both different people running our

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,210
projects we also have often different

00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:36,060
motivations for how we care about our

00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,370
brand and how we care about people using

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,980
our software or using our brand and our

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,709
reputation so that's why it's important

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,240
for this kind of talk that we understand

00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:47,220
that open-source is different than your

00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,810
traditional software vendor in terms of

00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,830
how to use their brand and how they

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,800
treat trademarks one important thing not

00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,800
just for open-source but overall is that

00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,650
today's fast-moving software world

00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,060
software is built from components so we

00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,260
sometimes talk about a single product

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,930
but sometimes we talk about the lamp

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,489
stack or a big data processing pipeline

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,590
with Hadoop and spark and something else

00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:14,489
on top and then miso is to manage the

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:18,209
cluster behind it that's an issue for

00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:20,360
the lawyers and for some of you the

00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:22,590
marketers because it's not always clear

00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,720
where the actual trade markets

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:28,110
trademarks are very specific symbols

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,970
that map to a very specific product or

00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,900
service and when we have a bunch of

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,360
components that we're putting together

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,000
some Apache projects we're running on

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,590
top of a specific Linux distro then a

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,080
company wants to come and build their

00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,269
special sauce that manages it there's

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,000
really three different names we may be

00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:46,680
talking about in that offering to some

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,860
customer which ones are those are

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,570
trademarks sometimes lawyers have on it

00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,680
when we talk to lawyers they'll say oh

00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,420
this is the trademark and you'll be like

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,630
that's not it this is what we talk about

00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,370
they're like no no that's the trademark

00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:02,160
but really software trademarks should be

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:05,299
easy because the open-source ethos is

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:08,130
sharing right we want to share our work

00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:10,200
somebody said permissively licensed

00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:13,380
products are practically giving away

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,060
their software or they are the name is

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:19,680
the only thing of value that the project

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,660
itself can own and control so the advice

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,640
to corporate consumers is don't mess

00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,770
with open-source project names because

00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,199
that's really the only

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,030
roll mechanism they have in terms of

00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,879
their reputation because when code is

00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:35,009
infinitely for Keable everybody can you

00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,919
have the code in technology but where

00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:42,060
the name the community goes is important

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:47,280
and this is doubly true for open source

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:49,110
because open source communities are more

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,210
often made up of developers and geeks

00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:53,699
and so on and often of distributed

00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:56,159
groups who are underrepresented in terms

00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:58,440
of legal representation so when you're

00:04:56,159 --> 00:05:00,000
thinking about this in the context of

00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,080
another vendor and you know should we

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,020
use their branding so we included

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,000
marketing there ways to decide that open

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,520
source projects don't have those

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,440
resources to help them understand the

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,690
issues whether it's them using your name

00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,810
or them finding out that you're using

00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:18,270
their name so we need to be extra

00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:21,000
careful with how we think about

00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:23,340
trademarks with open source projects so

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,229
if I'm talking about people not

00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:29,940
understanding we should be more specific

00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:32,669
about definitions what are trademarks so

00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,789
it might seem obvious but it's really

00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:39,080
important to understand that legally

00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:41,669
trademarks are a very specific thing I

00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:45,060
call it a trademark is a legal

00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:47,099
instantiation of your brand so the

00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,830
trademark is the specific name or logo

00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:51,569
the actual logo not just the some

00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,810
version of logo the logo you have on

00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:57,840
your homepage that refers to a specific

00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:01,409
software product or a service offering

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,840
Frank for example it doesn't really mean

00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:06,659
two lawyers the logo that points to your

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,360
github repo that's a really interesting

00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:11,610
I have is if I have just a github repo

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,699
and I plaster my name over it and I have

00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:18,120
a logo can I call those trademarks well

00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:19,830
lawyers would be like now geeks might be

00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,889
well yeah it's code okay

00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,449
is it a software product that's the

00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:28,770
place where the law doesn't really mesh

00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:32,520
with how the developers work with

00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:34,770
different products these days trademark

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,570
lawyers in particular will nag you to

00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,710
use them properly trademarks should be

00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:40,990
adjectives trans

00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:44,110
mark describes the product or service so

00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:46,500
I buy Kleenex brand tissues and we might

00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,820
use the jQuery JavaScript library

00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,670
because it's faster than the T Script

00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,080
framework trademark describes the thing

00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:56,650
that's how you know that this is the

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,720
trademark for that product now in common

00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,370
usage we often skip that over we sort of

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,560
say we're running Hadoop jobs on top of

00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:07,630
docker on top of mobi now actually right

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:10,690
but but it's important to use your own

00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:13,720
trademarks consistently and to mark them

00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:15,460
with the TM or our and to say Hadoop

00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,220
software or rather Apache Hadoop

00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,810
software on your home page so that other

00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,390
people can see you're doing it seriously

00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:24,100
even if they they may not notice their

00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:26,470
lawyers or their marketers will notice

00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,380
if you are using your names consistently

00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:31,830
we also have for Apache projects we have

00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:35,050
a naming guide so how we would like

00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,640
companies to use the names and brands

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:40,870
the Apache software projects so there's

00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:42,550
a link up here with that so again what

00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,010
is how does the trademark law apply to

00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:47,920
our open source projects and code and so

00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:50,260
on well don't confuse projects with

00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,600
products so this is something that I

00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,220
find myself writing over and over and

00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,500
emails and probably confusing people

00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,450
because like I was so in so project

00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:02,890
level that's the name like that's the

00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:05,530
name of the project around the community

00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:07,630
really what the trademark lawyers and if

00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,800
you ever have an issue where you talk to

00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,900
somebody about hey you're using my

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,050
trademark wrong trademark applies to the

00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:17,170
product so the thing that somebody

00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:20,050
downloads is what's actually trademark

00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:23,410
the project name the community the

00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:25,570
website is not typically a trademark it

00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:28,150
may be a trademark for the service you

00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:30,790
provide and that you provide consulting

00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:32,860
or Apache projects answer questions we

00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:37,540
provide support not paid support but we

00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:39,790
provide support but it's really tricky

00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:41,980
for lawyers now usually we doesn't

00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,360
matter the legal definitions but it

00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,860
helps to understand a little bit about

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,110
where the lawyers would come from when

00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,390
questions Klopp because we also have

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,680
multiple products from different

00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,810
projects earlier I said the example of

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,730
we might have this stream processor from

00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:56,500
Pachi and that database from this

00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,820
company and you're adding this

00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,850
management console from that company

00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:05,980
their separate bits what the trademarks

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:10,420
refer to can be important and of course

00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:13,420
open-source is geeky so one of the

00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:15,540
things I often talk to companies who

00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:20,500
perhaps don't come to Apache con about

00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:22,810
is even though our projects may seem

00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,339
geeky and may not seem you know we may

00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,680
not have a route develop roadmap and a

00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:29,680
marketing plan like other vendors do we

00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,330
take our code and we take our brands

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,900
just as seriously as some other vendor

00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:36,000
does so when you're using a brand or

00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,620
trademark from an open-source project

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,250
you need to treat it as respectfully as

00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:43,630
you would some other vendor because the

00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,430
people running most projects are very

00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:48,460
passionate about them there's often a

00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:52,750
much more personal connection to the

00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:55,750
Hadoop elephant or the the flink

00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:57,990
squirrel logo then would be in a

00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:00,880
commercial product out there and

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:02,170
open-source projects are often not as

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,850
familiar with trademark law so they

00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,440
won't understand things they should

00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,630
complain about versus things they can't

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,330
and sometimes they'll sort of complain

00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:14,280
in a very crazy and loud way but you

00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:19,000
want to avoid if you're using our names

00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:21,730
so what is the real purpose of a

00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,260
trademark so a lot of people I think

00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:26,320
don't come to it from the right

00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:28,300
perspective in that really trademarks

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,680
aren't for us building software at

00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,470
Apache and then giving it away and then

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,790
companies who use it to then build their

00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,920
own products on top of which is great

00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:38,980
and then make money trademarks are

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,290
really about the other people the users

00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,510
out there that's the easiest way to

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,280
understand how trademark law is supposed

00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:47,400
to work

00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:50,830
so trademarks really are but about

00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:56,140
preventing consumer confusion as to the

00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:58,600
producer or the source of goods so when

00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:01,720
a new user is searching on Google and

00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:05,230
looking for something if they get to

00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,280
somebody else's website by finding they

00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,700
go to somebody else's website by

00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,060
searching

00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,530
Loup and then download something they

00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,810
think is hadoop from somebody else's

00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:16,570
website that's bad that's confusing and

00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:19,060
consumer as to who it's providing the

00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:21,490
product that's something that's

00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:23,740
typically pretty easy in physical goods

00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:25,360
because you know you understand a coke

00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,770
bottle looks like this and you buy it

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,750
from a store you can go back to the

00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:31,230
store complaining software and the

00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:34,210
internet there's no boxes anymore

00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:36,070
right so understanding who it is it's

00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:39,220
providing the product is important

00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:42,610
because consumers what is the value to a

00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:44,950
brand it's that when a consumer sees the

00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,230
brand they expect a certain behavior

00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:50,050
they expect a certain quality certain

00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:52,000
level of reputation and support and if

00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:54,340
somebody else who's a fly-by-night

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,470
operator is giving away software with

00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,790
your name on it

00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,800
consumers will be angry because they got

00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:02,530
the wrong thing by mistake and of course

00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,170
that's bad for you so really that's the

00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:07,060
way to think about if you need to think

00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:09,580
about what the trademark for the product

00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,500
is and how it should be used think about

00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:13,720
the perspective of a new consumer coming

00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,210
to try to find it and would they be

00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,510
clear that the name you're thinking of

00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:24,450
is associated with your product or your

00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:29,040
Apache project so as a corollary

00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:31,960
trademarks only have a use in commerce

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,480
so you can't just trade mark something

00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,070
by writing it down like copyrights you

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,530
can only register a trademark which

00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:40,900
we'll get to later if you're actually

00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:42,850
using it if you're actually sticking in

00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,100
the old-fashioned world you're actually

00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,720
sticking the name on a box and putting

00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,010
it in a store for somebody to buy until

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,710
you do that it's not actually a

00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:56,140
trademark in most countries but actually

00:12:52,710 --> 00:13:01,780
doing that or on a website saying hey

00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:03,400
download Apache flink software here once

00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,410
you put that up on a website that's your

00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,970
trademark at a chief link is your

00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:10,060
trademark for this software product that

00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:13,660
somebody can download and in the US and

00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:15,250
Canada at least once you do that and if

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,770
you put a little TM symbol next to it

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,990
you can start accruing some legal rights

00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:22,240
to that trademark some common law rights

00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,220
now this is one place where I need to

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,160
warn people I'm primarily talking about

00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:29,620
US law here so every country has their

00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,240
own specific trademark law and many

00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,790
other countries work a little bit

00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,830
differently than the US does but in the

00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:39,310
u.s. at least if you are consistently

00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:40,390
saying hey get super thing here that's

00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:44,860
your trademark once you're actually

00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:47,260
providing it to the public so they

00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,640
always the important thing which I don't

00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,280
think we need to talk about here but in

00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,710
other places in other conferences this

00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,770
is really important is that open source

00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:57,940
product names are trademarks and

00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:01,990
companies out there need to respect them

00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:05,620
and there are still plenty of companies

00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:07,480
who otherwise are Clou phul who don't

00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,700
really get that some part of them gets

00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,580
it but a lot of the marketing

00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,380
departments don't and end up abusing a

00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,470
lot of open source projects including a

00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:20,380
number of Apache projects so we have

00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:22,270
plenty of great companies who work with

00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,950
as well and we have some great companies

00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:26,200
and we have Alan here who gave a talk

00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:28,750
this morning who not only work with as

00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,990
well but they are leading training for

00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:33,850
their employees of how to work well with

00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:36,370
open source projects all we want is

00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:38,280
respect and credit so it's not that hard

00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:41,920
but you do need to think about it and

00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:44,980
this is a real example we we hate it

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,060
when your users report bugs to us so I

00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,700
think about especially Linux

00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,830
distributions and down downstream or the

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,230
users may not be really realized whether

00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:55,660
it's Fedora or red hat or something

00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:58,080
different and they end up reporting the

00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:01,060
corporate bug to the open source project

00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,370
that's just you know the user doesn't

00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,540
know any better perhaps but the open

00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:07,600
source project can't do anything about

00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:10,060
it and we're already have enough to do

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,620
so that there's a real reason to make

00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,000
sure the branding is distinct and that

00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:17,050
you respect the open source products

00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,430
project branding so one thing I hear

00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,380
some people say is but it's open source

00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:23,140
so I should be able to share everything

00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:28,390
right like you you gave it away well no

00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:31,030
and this slide this slide is a perfect

00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,970
example of where when you have a lawyer

00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,839
in the room

00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:37,039
and a bunch of geeks and a bunch of

00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:40,399
businesspeople and even a few marketing

00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:42,259
people they'll to be saying oh we're

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,239
using such-and-such open-source project

00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:45,919
from Apache or Eclipse or wherever and

00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:47,209
we want to use in our branding campaign

00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,759
and it's open source so we can do this

00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:51,889
and literally everyone in the room

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,019
except maybe one marketer will be like

00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:57,739
oh it's open source it's already three

00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:58,759
and the lawyer and they'll sort of start

00:15:57,739 --> 00:16:01,249
talking about that without thinking

00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:03,439
thinking about it and the lawyer will

00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:05,889
not say anything because nobody's asked

00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:07,879
no question but the lawyer will realize

00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:11,689
okay it's open source software we need

00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:13,399
to think about the IP why are you

00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:15,729
talking about trademarks this license

00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:17,569
says nothing about trademarks and

00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:20,599
trademarks have nothing to do with

00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:23,449
copyright licenses so all OSI approved

00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:25,279
licenses are copyright licenses and they

00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:28,879
give you all these free great things you

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:33,249
can do rights not explicitly mentioned

00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:35,779
in a license are not granted at all so I

00:16:33,249 --> 00:16:39,109
appreciate that at least the GPL and the

00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:41,479
apache license explicitly exclude or or

00:16:39,109 --> 00:16:42,739
effectively exclude trademarks but all

00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:45,079
the other licenses out there that don't

00:16:42,739 --> 00:16:47,749
same thing about trademarks do not give

00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:52,099
you any trademark rights they only give

00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:53,779
you copyright rights so that's a and and

00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:54,859
once you have the lawyer in the room and

00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:57,259
you start saying okay we're going to use

00:16:54,859 --> 00:16:59,479
the trademark for this then the lawyer

00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:01,099
will suddenly say you can't do that and

00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:02,479
you'll be like why and they'll be like

00:17:01,099 --> 00:17:04,459
well you don't have a right you'll say

00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:07,699
well it's open source low and it lowers

00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:10,279
like but there's there's no trademark in

00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:11,779
that open source it's it's common thing

00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,490
that people don't realize

00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:15,759
so I point that out yes we have a

00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,759
question

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,160
okay so the question is are there grid

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,830
sources to help explain the difference

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,260
between I don't have a specific source

00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:43,690
for that there certainly are plenty of

00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,910
sort of basic explainers but you're

00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:55,240
right a really good explainer that's

00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:57,130
focused on open source software yeah yes

00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,970
I look a lot of the existing ones um

00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:02,440
that's a good question uh yeah I'll look

00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,600
at that there's a couple lawyers I know

00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,190
who actually have some good explainers I

00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,850
have links later about trademarks and

00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:11,830
that might be a really useful aspect

00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:15,160
because open source projects are really

00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:16,360
important nowadays and the intersection

00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,620
of those is really important when you

00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,500
have a bunch of open source projects

00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:23,230
with different licenses and a corporate

00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,970
product you want to build and if we

00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:28,090
could have even a little more

00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:30,130
understanding with all of us that would

00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:33,040
greatly save that amount of time the

00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:37,440
lawyers have to spend later on educating

00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:41,770
us so okay we'll do that later

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:45,430
so in real life though not with the

00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:49,060
lawyers usually how do trademarks work

00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:50,530
with open source software so okay we've

00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,830
talked about what the trademarks are but

00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:56,980
what does that mean can I say this about

00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:59,380
Apache spark or I can't say that no how

00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,670
can people use your trademark or an

00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:04,390
Apache project straight mark which is

00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:05,740
what I care about when someone else is

00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,690
in particular when someone else is using

00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,350
our trademarks how do we know if it's

00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:10,330
okay or not

00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:12,850
we shouldn't complain or if we should be

00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:16,570
happy with it well there's the likely

00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:19,120
hit hood of confusion test which

00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:21,340
measures a few things and they're

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,890
literally I have not yet figured out a

00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:25,780
better and more concise way to explain

00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:27,910
it to you than to simply read the

00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:30,670
paragraph from the US Patent and

00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:33,850
Trademark Office which says

00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:36,820
a likelihood of confusion exists between

00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:39,910
two or more trademarks when the

00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:41,530
trademarks are so similar and the goods

00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:45,670
and/or services for which those

00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:48,430
trademarks are used are so related that

00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:50,260
consumers would mistakenly believe they

00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:52,680
come from the same source the two

00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:55,060
products from the same source so each

00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,880
trademark registration application at

00:19:55,060 --> 00:20:02,230
the USPTO is decided on its own facts

00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:03,820
and no strict mechanical test exists for

00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:09,520
determining the likelihood of confusion

00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:10,900
I mean if I really need to help explain

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,510
it I can talk about it for a while

00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,490
longer but that really is the simplest

00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:19,150
way to think about it would a consumer

00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:24,490
would a user when they're thinking they

00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:27,070
want that crisp not too sweet sharp

00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:29,170
taste that comes in this swervy bottle

00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:32,850
with red and white logo could they ever

00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:35,800
be confused by getting that other drink

00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:38,590
that has a sweeter taste that usually

00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,610
has a red and white logo if if they

00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:41,200
would if they would go to the store to

00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,880
pick up the wrong one and drink it be

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,370
surprised

00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,750
that's confusion if they would never do

00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,850
that because they always could see the

00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:52,420
difference in the bottles then there's

00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:54,970
no confusion or if you have something

00:20:52,420 --> 00:21:00,370
that's not a soft drink they're probably

00:20:54,970 --> 00:21:02,080
not gonna be confused so it's kind of

00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:04,000
like designed to say have the lawyers

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,320
always have a job because you always

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,450
need a lawyer to to tell in real life

00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:12,040
plenty of trademark misuse happens and

00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,300
it doesn't really matter that much so

00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,460
it's not that big a deal it's not this

00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,140
is not a black and white world this is a

00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,990
grey world and it depends if it's

00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,370
important but when is it okay to use a

00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,920
trademark excuse somebody else's

00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:25,660
trademark rather well there's a term for

00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,820
that it's called the nominative use and

00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:32,200
in the US and several other countries

00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:33,940
it's a specific legal concept so the

00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:38,020
rest of the world is allowed to use your

00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:39,400
trademark to refer to your thing I mean

00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:43,090
we have to be able to talk about

00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,000
Hortonworks or cloudera or IBM because

00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,440
we you know

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,670
want to use their products or because

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,140
you know it's when you works there we

00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:49,520
have to talk about their thing using

00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,820
their name there's no other way to refer

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,820
to it

00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:56,060
I Drive a BMW and I can't explain to you

00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,710
what kind of car I Drive unless I say

00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,830
it's a BMW that's fine

00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:02,690
because it's clearly referring to the

00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:05,020
car that comes from barish motor and

00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,020
workings

00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:12,830
you can't imply a relationship or

00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:14,120
affiliation or endorsement because that

00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,220
might confuse somebody to thinking that

00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,770
you're part of them but you can post

00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:22,010
negative reviews you can post bad

00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:24,260
benchmarks you can say you know Yoyodyne

00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:25,880
super accelerator really sucks because

00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,370
of blah blah blah because you're

00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,990
referring to their thing that's not a

00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,600
trademark issue now they may not like

00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,800
you but there's no trademark problem

00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,790
with that because you're not confusing

00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:39,680
somebody as to where yoyo designs super

00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:42,170
thing comes from you can even do

00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,460
parodies and non-commercial free speech

00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:45,560
trademark law certainly is never going

00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,150
to touch free speech or other areas like

00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:51,380
that trademark law at least in the u.s.

00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:53,930
it's pretty specific and only helping to

00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:56,030
protect specific kinds of commerce so

00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:59,240
it's really not that broad even though

00:22:56,030 --> 00:23:01,040
people don't understand that so at the

00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,000
other end of the scale from nominative

00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:09,050
use which is okay the other end is is

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,010
infringement so this is where there's a

00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:12,290
problem this is where you should

00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:14,960
complain and this is where legally you

00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:18,650
can actually could take action to stop

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,920
somebody from misusing your brand again

00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:23,120
I'll read the USPTO statement because

00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,090
it's so complicated that this is the

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,830
best explanation in a short time

00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:29,900
trademark infringement is the

00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:33,050
unauthorized use of a trademark or

00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:37,400
service mark on or a connection with

00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:39,800
goods or services in a manner so in a

00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,530
way in the real world that is likely to

00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,270
cause confusion deception or mistake

00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:50,559
about the source of the goods or

00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:53,000
services the point there is

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:55,820
trademarks only exists in a place where

00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,100
there's some producer who has goods or

00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:00,860
services that they provide to the world

00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:03,799
and there are users who are looking for

00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:05,750
goods and services if they kind of know

00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:07,970
about your product or your company and

00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:12,200
they go search and they find somebody

00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:14,330
else's website if they then say huh

00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,940
maybe this is what I want and then go

00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:20,059
download it that's infringement because

00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,799
they were misled thinking that the brand

00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:23,450
image they had of you was actually the

00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:26,120
other side if they go to the other

00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:28,100
website and say oh well they hid this as

00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,139
comparison about you know super thing

00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,580
and giant thing but I don't want that

00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:32,299
one I want something else and they keep

00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:35,450
looking for you

00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:38,720
that's not confusion so it's really

00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:41,600
about can someone associate the brand

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,330
image they have with the producer of uh

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,480
specific good I think we have another

00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,480
question

00:24:52,640 --> 00:25:01,840
mmm yes so the question is about Debian

00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,830
the Linux distribution in the past

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,280
wanted to include the Firefox web

00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:09,230
browser and there was a trademark issue

00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:12,200
and for a while they instead would

00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:13,790
bundle the iceweasel web browser which

00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,450
was the same exact code with just a

00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:17,240
different logo

00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:20,860
yes that was a trademark issue so the

00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:23,780
particular way that the Mozilla

00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:26,210
trademark for Firefox and the logos they

00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:28,760
have a usage policy their trademarks of

00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:30,169
Mozilla that says you must do this you

00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:34,190
must do this you can't change the logo

00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:37,190
whatever and Debian in particular has a

00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:41,059
very they have the Debian social

00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:43,250
contract so a lot of their policies

00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:44,870
about software are about free software

00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:49,429
and about you must be able to change

00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:50,960
things and there was a conflict Mozilla

00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:52,610
said no you can't change this for your

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,320
use and that being said well fine we'll

00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:55,880
make it I squeezed --all well let's take

00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:00,080
a code we you know shave off the name

00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:02,799
and the logo but yes that was a record

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:06,640
and that was an unfortunate one where

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:08,870
Debian is respected enough producer that

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,610
it never would have been an issue in the

00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:12,080
real world the only issue was the

00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,419
policies of the two organizations didn't

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,210
quite match and if they had both said ok

00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:20,480
in this case we both you know a

00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:23,150
reputable players will shave this little

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,340
piece of policy for you it would MIT

00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:26,600
time but they didn't and that's that's

00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,059
what needs to happen because you need to

00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,860
respect everybody else's trademark as

00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:37,390
much as you do need to respect licenses

00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:37,390
oh another question

00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:49,369
I don't think we try to do but the other

00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:53,980
day I went searching on Apache big data

00:26:49,369 --> 00:26:53,980
time to schedule and my data works um

00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:11,729
other fine

00:27:02,909 --> 00:27:14,129
yes so I don't I don't the question is

00:27:11,729 --> 00:27:16,019
are there legal rulings on use of

00:27:14,129 --> 00:27:18,629
trademarks in search engines in

00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:23,399
particular for keyword search buying an

00:27:18,629 --> 00:27:25,769
ad I'm not aware of them specifically

00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:29,309
but I don't initially follow them that's

00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:34,080
a tricky case because a lot of trademark

00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:37,619
law is pretty far behind how the actual

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,090
software world is used so how we work in

00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:42,330
software and do code that has nothing to

00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:44,099
do straight marks but how we say hey go

00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:46,619
come download my stuff because it's cool

00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:49,979
or a company says hey we have five new

00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:52,649
products and once people find it that is

00:27:49,979 --> 00:27:58,489
part of a trademark law and turbo Clause

00:27:52,649 --> 00:28:01,019
is not caught up to that in detail

00:27:58,489 --> 00:28:02,759
there there certainly are if you ask

00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:05,999
your lawyers they certainly will say

00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:08,129
certain things the question is is the

00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:10,950
use in the search engine context itself

00:28:08,129 --> 00:28:14,399
an infringement and that's tricky

00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:15,979
because the searching process isn't

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,259
necessarily going to be part of the

00:28:15,979 --> 00:28:21,599
buying decision process so if the stat

00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:24,059
search process brings you to their

00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,320
webpage that's clearly branded

00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:27,179
inappropriately and then you buy the

00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,489
product then yes that's a problem that's

00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:31,289
a Bridgman if it brings you to their

00:28:29,489 --> 00:28:33,299
page and they have a comparison page

00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:36,359
saying hey we're so much better than

00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:39,239
those guys are the users not going to be

00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:42,119
confused as to who is providing one of

00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:45,539
those two things now it may be unfair

00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:49,979
competition that they are co-opting your

00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:52,139
brand in a in an unseen way to change

00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:55,499
user perception that's a separate

00:28:52,139 --> 00:28:57,389
question and I imagine I'm almost

00:28:55,499 --> 00:28:59,429
surprised I haven't like that hasn't

00:28:57,389 --> 00:29:03,889
come more to the fore because it is such

00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:07,710
a complex place place in the real world

00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:09,479
what's far more useful is simply if that

00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:11,700
happens reporting it to the search

00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:14,639
provider right I mean a lot of these

00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:16,470
things aren't legal cases it's reported

00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:16,950
the search provider you know they'll

00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,420
stop it

00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:20,070
somewhere you can try buying it again

00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:25,260
you can go to the whoever's buying that

00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:27,680
ad and say hey that's not okay so that

00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:30,090
brings us to everything else between

00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:34,350
nominative use which is always okay and

00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:35,940
infringement which is not okay but until

00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:42,270
somebody complains you can get away with

00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:44,610
it it's everything else so there's no

00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:47,070
simple rule to say if any specific use

00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:49,290
is infringing or not you need to look at

00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:51,270
the specific place they're using it you

00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:53,690
need to look at the whole webpage or the

00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:56,400
video that's somebody using it within

00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:58,350
you need to look at are they using part

00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,390
of your mark from their using in a way

00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:01,560
that's talking about products or are

00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:04,800
they using it in a way that's talking

00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:06,930
about how they you know maybe they use

00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,720
your product and it really killed their

00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:12,710
their business process and they thought

00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:18,510
it was bad it's not a problem

00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:20,040
the you have to look at each particular

00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:22,680
thing now that's not to say that you

00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:25,320
can't ask someone if you think someone

00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:27,180
is improperly using your brand you can

00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,370
certainly ask them to change and that's

00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:32,190
something we need to do more often when

00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:34,140
you see somebody else using your brand

00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:36,840
in a way that you know you feel hurts

00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:39,210
you ask them exchanged now they don't

00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,770
have to right but in a lot of cases they

00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,660
will if they value their reputation

00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:43,620
especially in the Apache projects

00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:49,040
because we have a pretty good reputation

00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:50,910
and really there is a simple answer I

00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,380
should have this earlier there's a

00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:55,410
simple answer for telling you whether or

00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:59,100
not something is an infringement it

00:30:55,410 --> 00:31:01,200
depends I can use that answer for almost

00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,060
any time you come to be saying is it

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:09,030
okay if I say a passing loop does blah

00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:11,760
it depends nothing actually a lawyer but

00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:14,130
but we have we have a game for that

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,420
let's play the game since at the end of

00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:17,600
the day I'll make sure every state awake

00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:20,490
we're to play the game spot the lawyers

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,800
so this game let's just see who in the

00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:25,050
room is secretly a lawyer because they

00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,000
are going to start twitching over the

00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:29,360
next few slides okay so watch watch your

00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,870
fellow attendees here okay right so

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:35,610
trademarks

00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:36,840
are just like copyrights and the lawyer

00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,920
to be twitching so we never the lower

00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:41,780
and we don't have any lawyers who'd say

00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:44,220
because when you register either one

00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:46,200
with either the Copyright Office of the

00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,940
trademark office you can win more

00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,790
compensation if you actually have a

00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:52,830
lawsuit and Sue successfully and say

00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:54,420
damage was done so if your registration

00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:56,430
you can actually get a lot of money if

00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:58,710
you don't well you can sue but you won't

00:31:56,430 --> 00:32:03,960
really get damages so they're they're a

00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:08,510
lot alike right trademarks are also just

00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:13,200
like patents see they're all connected

00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:15,990
because they both have to have a

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,270
function you can only patent an

00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:20,420
invention if it does something it has to

00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:23,100
have a process there should be a purpose

00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:24,350
except for design patents but let's not

00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,670
talk about those those are weird

00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:29,430
trademarks only have value if used in

00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:30,990
commerce you can talk about my super

00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:33,450
thing in my pocket and it's awesome and

00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:35,490
it's great unless you actually ever

00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:38,040
provide it as a product that somebody

00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:39,690
else could buy or download now you don't

00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,880
have open-source can't have trademarks

00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:44,250
you don't have to have pay for a product

00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:48,350
that you create mark but if you never

00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:51,660
use it in commerce it's not okay mark so

00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:57,360
no really the three things are not at

00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:59,100
all like and any of the well I don't

00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,850
even want to say intellectual property

00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:04,370
because that's a kind of not very good

00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:07,290
description of the three kinds of

00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:09,000
property but they're not at all alike

00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:11,280
but it's a good way to find the lawyers

00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,860
so registered trademarks so there's a

00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,840
little R means registered and there's a

00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:17,550
little TM which means it's not

00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:23,160
registered they're both important but

00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:26,220
they're different in the US and Canada

00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:28,740
if you are using your name for your

00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:30,210
product that's your trademark and it

00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,880
still has value even though some people

00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:35,130
will think it doesn't if you register

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,290
your trademark either in the US or in

00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:40,680
any other country or in Europe the EU

00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:41,910
has its own registry oh it takes several

00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,020
months once that happens you have

00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:47,140
significantly more rights

00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:51,040
to preventing somebody else from using

00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:53,170
your name in the US it's fairly simple

00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,300
you fill out an application it's a few

00:33:53,170 --> 00:34:00,250
hundred dollars it still takes six

00:33:55,300 --> 00:34:02,920
months because that's how they work when

00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:06,340
you do a trademark search which a lot of

00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,750
commercial companies will do you the

00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:09,129
lawyers will do an exhaustive search

00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:11,290
saying could there be possibly be

00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:13,330
anybody we know of existing lis who

00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:14,860
would can who would you know because

00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:16,780
look at this name before we try and

00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:20,860
register it you don't actually need to

00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:22,510
need to do that it certainly helps in

00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,619
terms of understanding if there's

00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:26,860
somebody else who you might be stepping

00:34:23,619 --> 00:34:28,750
on the toes of but we don't do that any

00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,250
Apache project that would like to

00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:34,119
register their name I will try and help

00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:35,679
them do that the ASF owns all trademarks

00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:37,990
on behalf of our project so I'm happy to

00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:41,230
help register your name there's a link

00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:44,830
here just send me a simple question when

00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:46,600
you do register you register in specific

00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:51,909
classes so a registration has to be in

00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:55,090
the right class class nine is scientific

00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:55,990
instruments and surveying materials and

00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:59,950
a whole bunch of other things and

00:34:55,990 --> 00:35:01,780
software products sky machining class 32

00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:04,560
is beer fruit juice mineral water class

00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:08,410
33 goes alcoholic beverages but not beer

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:13,180
astonishing distinction 42 is services

00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:15,400
related to computers now legally the

00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:17,820
classes don't actually matter in terms

00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,230
of determining likelihood of confusion

00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,400
later they actually it's part of the

00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:24,460
registration process but it's not

00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:28,359
actually legally part of the confusion

00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:29,710
test but in reality if you are providing

00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:32,320
a software product here download this

00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:34,960
and I'm saying I can tell you how to you

00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,070
so and so they're clearly different

00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,980
functionalities they're clearly

00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:40,450
different consumers consumer is not

00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,680
going to confuse one for the other

00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:43,840
because they're looking for a different

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:47,109
kind of thing so trademarks do only

00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:49,359
tends to apply for products that have

00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:52,510
similar functionalities so you can

00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:55,330
indeed have a you know super thing

00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:56,770
command line editor and also have a

00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:59,170
super thing

00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:02,260
tax product you know tax referring

00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:03,760
corporations offer because any consumer

00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:06,340
would know if they got to the wrong

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,660
website I don't want that crazy I don't

00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:11,369
understand what command-line arguments

00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,369
are I want my taxes oh I want this one

00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:21,640
yes so TurboTax indeed offers both the

00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:23,410
product you can buy in a box still and

00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:26,080
an online service that just everything

00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:30,000
lives yes those are those are legally

00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:34,150
those are separate trademarks so one is

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,170
yes and that's they probably pay ten

00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:41,320
times that because they probably

00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:46,119
register both as yeah from the

00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:48,490
open-source perspective well so why

00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:50,860
would we want to register because it

00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:52,600
prevents problems it's like it's for

00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:55,510
open-source projects it's like an

00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:58,180
insurance policy so if you have that and

00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:59,980
now it important lis make the

00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:02,710
application you need to wait until it

00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:05,080
gets through the whole process after

00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:08,109
your registration is issued which only

00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:10,630
comes from a national registry then you

00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:12,070
should switch your TM to an AR don't do

00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:15,490
it beforehand because if the examiner

00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:18,160
sees it they'll complain why is it

00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:21,369
important because if you do this then

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:24,369
people will notice so there are really

00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:26,410
two reasons to register one is the

00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:28,420
obvious one is that if somebody does

00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:30,280
infringe and you want to go after them

00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,840
you say hey I have this registered

00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:36,700
trademark see there's a little R here's

00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:39,280
my registration number if you in any

00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:41,500
respectable open-source product if you

00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,380
do that to some vendor they will

00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:45,910
eventually fix the problem because at

00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:48,310
some point even if they want to push

00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:50,140
back that email will go through their

00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:52,990
business and at some point we'll hit a

00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:54,400
lawyer and the lawyer will say ha they

00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:55,750
claim it's registered I'll look it up

00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,300
I'll see the registration number and the

00:37:55,750 --> 00:38:03,250
lawyer will say don't fight this give it

00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:06,250
up period the other reason that having

00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:08,470
registration is important is lawyers and

00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:09,960
marketers tend to do searches before

00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:11,910
they launch product campaigns

00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,970
they tend to do something like a

00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:16,140
trademark search and if they see when

00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:19,140
you have a registration it's in this

00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:21,420
giant database that they will look at so

00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:24,059
they will not they won't start a

00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:27,630
campaign that infringes because they'll

00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:30,210
see it ahead of time so those are both

00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:53,069
really important reasons to have the

00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:54,690
registration question this yes okay so

00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:57,210
if you're when you're applying for

00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:59,309
registration given that it takes a long

00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:01,410
time typically in the u.s. it's four to

00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:03,119
six months can you submit several

00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:04,230
applications that are you know in case

00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,280
there's our problem with one the other

00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:09,720
one will go through no you obviously

00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:13,170
need to ask your lawyer that question

00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:15,270
but I would say no because typically in

00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:16,950
the US other most other countries are

00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,690
similar although the details are

00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:21,540
different in the US you submit the

00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:23,609
application they sort of check our all

00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:26,040
the things there eventually an

00:39:23,609 --> 00:39:26,970
examiner's assigned who then checks to

00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,460
make sure that the way you have

00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:31,799
specified things matches their criteria

00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,750
and then they do a search they

00:39:31,799 --> 00:39:37,079
essentially do a trademark search of

00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:41,010
existing registered marks of any that

00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:42,900
could be similar and at that point if

00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:45,480
they if they find an issue they will

00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,349
have an office action so if they think

00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,720
there's a problem with your application

00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:50,730
they'll stop it they'll send your

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,190
lawyers a formal thing saying we believe

00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:55,530
this may conflict explain to us why it

00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:57,420
does not and then your lawyers write

00:39:55,530 --> 00:40:00,150
back so that that process is part how

00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:03,960
you would then change to adapt that and

00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:06,720
typically what you do is sometimes you

00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,760
reduce your claim of goods all right you

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,559
say well we don't make database and

00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,240
downloadable software and online

00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:14,400
software and so on we only make database

00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:18,030
software sometimes you have to change

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,829
the actual mark and sometimes it gets

00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:22,800
you know it's going to get rejected so

00:40:19,829 --> 00:40:25,720
you create a new application

00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,370
so one bit of feedback I sometimes hear

00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:31,120
is if we registered we have to do more

00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:32,890
work well there is a duty to police

00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,420
which some people tend to worry about

00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:38,110
that if we were registered we have to

00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:40,150
suddenly do all this policing work well

00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:41,500
especially you talk to your lawyers

00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:42,910
they're going to tell you about I have

00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,550
to do all the stuff and sign up for a

00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:49,300
trademark watch list and all that stuff

00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:51,970
yeah no there's no specific law or

00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:55,030
process that defines the minimum amount

00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:58,140
of policing you have to do now if you if

00:40:55,030 --> 00:41:00,970
you don't police that is if you don't

00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:03,010
address other people's improper uses of

00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:07,120
your mark eventually that's going to

00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:08,650
weaken your legal ability to do so but

00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:12,100
in the real world for our kind of

00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:13,710
projects doesn't matter that much now if

00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:16,210
there are people doing things

00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:18,250
egregiously bad then yes you should work

00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:20,050
on it because otherwise users are going

00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:21,160
to not see your thing they're going to

00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:23,080
see something else something crated for

00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,220
the practical reason the legal reasons

00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:28,590
are not as important for open source

00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:31,780
projects what's actually as important as

00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:35,560
thinking about policing is making sure

00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:36,940
you use your own marks consistently so I

00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:41,170
was talking with one lawyer who who

00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:43,660
actually said like it she they get open

00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:45,940
source like well what really is

00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:48,310
important and they're like the most

00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:51,340
important thing is on your home page and

00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:54,430
on your download page use your trademark

00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:57,160
appropriately but the TMR are uses an

00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:59,610
adjective and say download Apache flink

00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:02,050
software here Apache flink with the TM

00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:04,360
dad is the most important thing because

00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:06,900
people who read it see it and say oh

00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:09,250
that's that's your brand and anytime

00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:11,410
there's a question later and a lawyer

00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:13,030
reads it first thing a lawyer will do is

00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:15,370
did they actually treat it like a

00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:18,250
trademark yes okay well maybe we have to

00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:19,750
pay attention so that's actually it's

00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:22,270
far more important that we as open

00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:25,480
source projects display ourselves well

00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:26,620
which just means it's really just

00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,390
thinking about your homepage in your

00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:30,010
download page the rest your web presence

00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:31,750
yes it would be great but I know we

00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:34,780
don't always have time and open source

00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:35,650
for all the documentation so how could

00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:38,670
you

00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:41,469
take action so this is both focused on

00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:43,599
business leaders who want to work better

00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:45,969
with open source as well as Apache

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,890
projects that I hope are are doing these

00:42:45,969 --> 00:42:49,809
things by using the name appropriately

00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:53,109
and coming to me they will request

00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:55,630
registering their name first one is

00:42:53,109 --> 00:42:57,369
having a trademark policy so if you're

00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:58,630
thinking about a startup or thinking

00:42:57,369 --> 00:43:01,839
about forking something and doing your

00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:04,749
own own new name have a policy for your

00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:10,410
brand Apache has one it applies to all

00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:13,180
projects it's off of this link here a

00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:14,979
really important thing I think a lot of

00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:16,059
companies might not may not have but

00:43:14,979 --> 00:43:18,269
companies that work in the open-source

00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:21,609
area well Allen's company here because

00:43:18,269 --> 00:43:25,239
if your company have a policy of how you

00:43:21,609 --> 00:43:26,529
will use open-source trademarks you

00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:28,259
probably have a policy of how your

00:43:26,529 --> 00:43:32,200
engineers are allowed to contribute code

00:43:28,259 --> 00:43:34,269
if you don't you should but also for

00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,650
your marketers have a policy how do you

00:43:34,269 --> 00:43:37,180
treat these open-source things you want

00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:40,029
to jump on the latest open source panda

00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:41,589
bag and it's hot are you going to use

00:43:40,029 --> 00:43:45,279
their branding at all or not or usually

00:43:41,589 --> 00:43:46,930
only use your branding hopefully you're

00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:49,299
also respecting the officers branding

00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:50,559
but having a policy of how you'll do

00:43:49,299 --> 00:43:52,269
that and especially if you can publish

00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:55,210
that and let the open-source community

00:43:52,269 --> 00:43:56,769
know yes we respect you we want to we

00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:58,989
want to partner with you how can we do

00:43:56,769 --> 00:44:00,700
that just open up the communication

00:43:58,989 --> 00:44:06,130
rather than just letting your marketers

00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:08,609
go off because it's really important to

00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:10,599
respect open-source trademarks I

00:44:08,609 --> 00:44:12,309
apologize to those of you here in the

00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:14,170
front row I don't need to tell you this

00:44:12,309 --> 00:44:15,430
because you came to Apache con but there

00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:18,249
are a lot of other business leaders that

00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:20,769
do not completely get this think about

00:44:18,249 --> 00:44:23,380
every open-source project as a separate

00:44:20,769 --> 00:44:26,140
vendor in a space and how would you

00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:28,509
treat their brands because we may not

00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:30,940
we open-source geeks and disorganize

00:44:28,509 --> 00:44:32,950
projects may not appear the same way but

00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:36,729
we care about our names just as much as

00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:38,109
any other vendor does and in particular

00:44:36,729 --> 00:44:42,239
when there's a when there's a problem

00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:42,239
when we come to a company to complain I

00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:48,069
have been I've done that and I've been

00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:51,309
sent to talk to a lawyer

00:44:48,069 --> 00:44:53,979
and I've now learned that there's no

00:44:51,309 --> 00:44:56,109
point this is not if a company is

00:44:53,979 --> 00:44:58,199
misusing an Apache brand is not a legal

00:44:56,109 --> 00:45:00,099
question it's a business question

00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:02,380
because if that business is actually

00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:06,009
using our software they want to be able

00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:07,479
to participate in our communities and if

00:45:06,009 --> 00:45:10,150
I can explain that to their business

00:45:07,479 --> 00:45:12,729
leader they'll say oh yeah I'm sorry

00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:14,769
totally we'll fix that I talked to their

00:45:12,729 --> 00:45:15,969
lawyer they don't care about that they

00:45:14,769 --> 00:45:17,949
don't care about the reputation

00:45:15,969 --> 00:45:21,009
about the fact that their business runs

00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:24,099
on five Apache projects so it's really

00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:25,630
important here as an open-source project

00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:27,849
to understand that perspective that

00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:29,920
these companies we may not have

00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:32,380
marketing departments to fight back but

00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,209
these companies do need to respect the

00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:36,009
software that they're using in terms of

00:45:34,209 --> 00:45:39,670
the branding and the reputation of

00:45:36,009 --> 00:45:42,279
community and of course every Apache

00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:46,239
project I'm here at helped along with

00:45:42,279 --> 00:45:49,150
the Apaches of BASF slaughters seeking

00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:50,619
of lawyers the number one rule which

00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:54,099
I'll just put here at the end is avoid

00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:58,449
court you never want to go to court for

00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:59,680
lawsuits for trademarks sometimes people

00:45:58,449 --> 00:46:01,089
say oh this company's doing a horrible

00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,509
thing and yes I checked it's really

00:46:01,089 --> 00:46:07,180
horrible let's send them a CD no never

00:46:04,509 --> 00:46:09,279
the first step to go to legal issues the

00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:11,440
first step is always if somebody's if

00:46:09,279 --> 00:46:13,869
somebody truly is badly misusing your

00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,130
project name is to send them one of the

00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:15,729
letters I have a template I should have

00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:17,619
a link here

00:46:15,729 --> 00:46:19,839
Apache projects we have a template for

00:46:17,619 --> 00:46:21,279
saying hey we're attached project this

00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:24,180
is our trademark we believe you're

00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:27,279
misusing it please you need to stop

00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:29,529
because a lot of the time that works

00:46:27,279 --> 00:46:32,229
they're like you know the right product

00:46:29,529 --> 00:46:34,420
manager says oh sorry yeah that's we're

00:46:32,229 --> 00:46:36,579
wrong I'll fix it if that doesn't work

00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:38,380
then I can send a letter and I'll sign

00:46:36,579 --> 00:46:39,940
it with my title and that tends to get

00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:42,819
to a higher level management who will

00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:44,799
say oh this important with the patter

00:46:42,819 --> 00:46:47,979
this relationship with Apache is

00:46:44,799 --> 00:46:52,809
important so we'll stop we don't need to

00:46:47,979 --> 00:46:55,239
involve lawyers especially for open

00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:57,059
source communities who don't have one of

00:46:55,239 --> 00:46:59,369
the things that's a disparity is

00:46:57,059 --> 00:47:01,690
commercial companies even smaller ones

00:46:59,369 --> 00:47:03,130
have a lawyer on staff

00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:05,950
right there used to that they have a

00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:08,290
marketing person who work as a part of a

00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:10,270
team open-source communities sometimes

00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:11,740
have a marketing person but it's a

00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:14,110
distributed community there's no direct

00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:16,090
connection so it's thinking about these

00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:17,380
issues thinking about Wow somebody's

00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:19,900
launched this campaign over there we

00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:22,450
need to address it in a company it's a

00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:25,180
very simple set of steps to get action

00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:27,790
in an open-source community it's not as

00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:30,310
obvious so the action tends to come much

00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:32,110
later than some poorly done campaign

00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:34,360
comes up and that's going to be an issue

00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:36,850
for a while because the later that you

00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:39,030
wait to address something the harder it

00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:44,320
is for the other party to make changes

00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:46,840
and one thing is that I say to some

00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:50,440
companies is open source talent I was at

00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:52,690
one conference where you know all the

00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,950
booze half the booths were more partly

00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:55,480
recruiting they're like guess you know

00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:57,100
you won't work for us and here's why we

00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:00,100
were cool because we participate here

00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:02,020
well if you want open-source people to

00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:04,990
work for you then you need to respect

00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:07,420
their work whether it's some other open

00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:10,870
source project or it may you may want

00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:12,550
this hot engineer and they realized you

00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:16,630
didn't treat their project from five

00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:18,550
years ago very well so this is going to

00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:21,040
matter in the long term in terms of this

00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:22,540
is how software works we expect that

00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:25,300
open source projects get the same

00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:26,350
respect as vendors if you want to do

00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,050
something if you don't want to username

00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:31,630
that's great if you do yours your name

00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:34,110
give us the credit that's all we ask and

00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:36,910
then that's really the final lesson is

00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:38,710
open source works when you can take

00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:39,160
value from our technology that's why we

00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:41,530
do it

00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:43,690
that's the maintenance benefit the

00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:45,760
innovation benefit of everybody all

00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:49,270
these competitors saying ok I'll throw

00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,350
this one little bit in together if we

00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:53,260
didn't get value from what they wouldn't

00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:55,180
do it and all open-source wants back and

00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:58,030
return is to give credit we want credit

00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:59,950
for the work we do we're an Apache we're

00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:02,080
happy if you go make millions of dollars

00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:05,470
on top of our stops and we have a plenty

00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:08,860
of examples that do that just along the

00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:10,620
way if you're using any of our names

00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:12,560
give us the credit for the part we built

00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:16,010
that's what going out

00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:17,630
and questions and answers so we've

00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:18,860
already taken a few questions or just

00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:22,310
about the end of times I don't know how

00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:26,620
long the video will run but I do have a

00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:26,620
couple related to your question earlier

00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:35,210
there are two websites that help explain

00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:37,820
trademark law and open source in a way

00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:39,830
that's that's geared Tugg to us not to

00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:41,750
lawyers so there's one that called the

00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:44,060
model trademark guidelines which I'm

00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:48,050
kind of surprised it hasn't gotten

00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:49,610
noticed much essentially a lawyer and a

00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:52,160
small group of people who get open

00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:54,970
source essentially wrote a complete

00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:57,320
trademark policy says you know this

00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:59,750
policy applies to dollar sign trademark

00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:01,550
name and we are an open source project

00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:03,350
called dollar sign project name right

00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:05,060
you can just replace it copy the whole

00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:07,490
thing replace things have a great policy

00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:12,590
and it makes sense for open source

00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:14,540
groups another one that helps explain

00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:16,810
some of the questions of what does it

00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:21,230
really mean why would you do this is

00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:22,970
Foss marks org so another set of for

00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:27,800
lawyers who get open source who really

00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:29,360
do wrote a very personable thing saying

00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,560
hey you're you've got this new startup

00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:33,920
and you come up with a great new name

00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:35,150
and you want to have you know protect

00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,840
your name you think you should do

00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:38,510
something about it

00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:41,090
what do you think about and that leads

00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:43,190
through a bunch of steps of we should

00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:45,050
use the name consistently which is call

00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:47,600
a trademark eventually we should

00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:49,430
register it and then what do we do if we

00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:52,700
have problems so that's actually a very

00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:54,560
good resource now it's just trademarks

00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:56,620
it doesn't deal with copyrights patents

00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:59,780
but it's that's a very approachable

00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:02,390
explanation and of course a resources

00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:04,070
link here so Apache projects of course

00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:07,190
if you're participating an Apache

00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:10,130
project which you probably are we have

00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:12,380
our trademark info sitemap here so at

00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:15,890
the Apache org website

00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:19,280
I have so many different documents that

00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:20,900
explain social media guidelines and use

00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,150
and services or use an event name

00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:25,640
branding that I simply wrote a custom

00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:26,930
sitemap for all the things so

00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:29,029
everything you need to know about

00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:32,779
trademarks or questions you might have

00:51:29,029 --> 00:51:35,930
for Apache projects or using Apache

00:51:32,779 --> 00:51:38,210
projects is linked to from here no

00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:40,279
really everything is linked to from here

00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:42,890
so if you have a question that's not

00:51:40,279 --> 00:51:47,329
answered here then come let me know and

00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:49,910
asks trademarks add Apaches or and that

00:51:47,329 --> 00:51:56,590
is all we have time for tonight so thank

00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:59,729
you thanks oh good night

00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:59,729
