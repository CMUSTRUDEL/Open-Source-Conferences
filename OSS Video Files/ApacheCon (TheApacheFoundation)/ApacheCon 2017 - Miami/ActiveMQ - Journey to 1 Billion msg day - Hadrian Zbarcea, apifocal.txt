	ActiveMQ - Journey to 1 Billion msg/day - Hadrian Zbarcea, apifocal

Asynchronous messaging is a necessary complement to the more synchronous REST. Apache ActiveMQ is the de-facto leader of the JMS based messaging frameworks. Robust and feature rich, ActiveMQ provides excellent scalability characteristics via networks of brokers. However, ActiveMQ alone is not sufficient by itself when deploying a massively scalable, secure and self-healing cluster of brokers. This talk walks the audience through the requirements, choices and solutions adopted when deploying in production such a messaging system.
