	Apache OpenWhisk: How it Works and How You Can Benefit - Carlos Santana, IBM

Apache OpenWhisk is a serverless platform ideally suited to a wide range of scenarios including cognitive, data, IoT, microservices, and mobile workloads. During this talk we will illustrate how to benefit by “going” serverless with OpenWhisk by exploring some real-world customer use-cases with a focus on how serverless architectures can be exploited for cognitive applications such as multimedia (images & videos) analysis & object detection, and conversational applications.

Using these use-cases we will explain how OpenWhisk works and why it is the ideally platform for these emerging workloads. We will also show new integrations with other tools such as API Gateway to enable the building of APIs/backends as well as extensions to the programming model.
