Description: 
	How to Get Your Release Through the Incubator - Justin Mclean, Class Software

All podling releases need to voted on by the incubator PMC before being released to the world. I'll go though what the incubator PMC looks for in every release and what you can do to make it pass that IPMC vote and get your project one step closer to graduation.

In this talk I'll describe current incubator and ASF policy, recent changes that you may not be aware of, and go into detail the legal requirements of common open source licenses and the best way to assemble your NOTICE and LICENSE files. Where possible I describe the reasons behind why things are done a certain which may not always be obvious from our documentation.

I'll show how I review a release and the simple tools I use. I'll go through a worked example or two, including a fictional project called Apache Wombat, and cover common mistakes I've seen in releases and finally where you can get help if you need it.

this is how to get your release through

00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:07,519
the incubator I'm just McClane I've been

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,650
a freelance developer for about 25 years

00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:12,900
I'm on the incubator PMC which is why

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,990
I'm giving this talk I'm also on the

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,420
Flex PMC and a few others as well I'm an

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,279
Apache member and I'm also a mentor for

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,890
several incubating projects and I can

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,140
see a couple people in the audience who

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,810
are part of those groups so that's good

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:31,650
I have reviewed more than 200 liver

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:35,640
releases at the Ella pachi some of them

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:37,110
quite thoroughly I also happen to run an

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,660
IO to meet up in Sydney and you may have

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,969
come to some of my other I ot talks that

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,390
I've given at this this conference now

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:47,219
first off I am NOT a lawyer I have not

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,559
been trained in law and I think legally

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:52,739
I'm not supposed to give legal advice so

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:57,390
I am mentioning licensing and a few

00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:59,010
other things in this talk so um just be

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,219
aware that I am NOT a lawyer

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,809
occasionally I do get things wrong my

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,810
understanding about licensing at Apache

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:10,020
has changed over time as well and policy

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:13,590
does change over time as well sometimes

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,810
it's complex and there's more than one

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,970
right answer

00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:20,790
sometimes one project will do one thing

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,110
in one way and that's good for them but

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,490
that may not be the right answer for

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:30,180
another project this is why this is

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:33,990
sometimes confusing I'm also a volunteer

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,299
and I'm not paid to do this so uh and

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,400
this talk is my own views and may not

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,829
represent the incubator as a whole the

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,450
incubator is quite large has lots of

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,790
people on it and they have lots of

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,500
different opinions about things if you

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,450
hang out of the incubator mailing list I

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:54,530
am sure you might have noticed that by

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:57,719
now oh so the whole process of about

00:01:54,530 --> 00:02:02,189
incubation is to make sure that a

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:04,229
project coming to Apache follows a

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,869
couple of things the first thing is that

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:10,099
the project must comply with the Apache

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:10,099
2.0 license

00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:17,069
it must follow the AF structure of

00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:18,680
contributors committers and pmc and have

00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:21,840
the right checks and balances in place

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,459
so that it operates like other Apache

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,319
projects there's that there's a bit of

00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,720
freedom in there and PMC's are mostly

00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,950
left alone to do whatever they want but

00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,360
there are a few things that they do have

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,519
to follow you know they have to vote on

00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,510
releases they've got a vote committees

00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:39,239
and pnc members in they have to grant

00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:42,450
more responsibility mode via Metro

00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:45,780
accuracy that means if they see someone

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:48,840
who is contributing to the project they

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,970
should vote them in as a committee so

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,640
they have to ensure that decision-making

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,019
is done in the open if it's not on the

00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,180
mailing list it's not on the mailing

00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,599
list you may have heard that or if it's

00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:03,150
not on the mailing list it didn't happen

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,819
so um and also have to ensure that

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:08,459
people act as individuals not companies

00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:10,079
so when you're on an apache list you are

00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,170
not representing your company you are

00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:14,850
yourself your job may change and that

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,769
means that you may not be involved in

00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:20,280
this project anymore well you may do I

00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:23,310
don't know but we companies are not

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,959
members of Apache individuals are um and

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,950
all of this sort of comes under a thing

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,200
called the apache way and most of that

00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:33,239
is some of it is documented some of it

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,329
isn't documented some of it is tribal

00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,519
knowledge and we just hope that by going

00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:42,090
through the incubation process we show

00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:44,810
you enough that you can come to the same

00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:48,959
point that other top-level projects have

00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:52,349
I'm so the VOC process um

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:57,960
Hill here has made an incubating evoke

00:03:52,349 --> 00:04:02,740
under the incubator 3 welcome

00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:06,970
everything who here is going to make a

00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:08,980
vote right that's why what I expect

00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,990
people to come along to this talk right

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,580
you you want to make the process as

00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:16,050
smooth as possible for you I'm going to

00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:18,940
tell you where I've seen other pod wings

00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:22,420
have some issues and how to fix those

00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:24,580
issues so anyway the the process is that

00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,370
the problem creates a release candidate

00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:30,790
they have a vote on the mailing list

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:33,220
generally open for 72 hours and they

00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:37,780
have to have 3 plus 1 points and more

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,850
plus 1 the minus 1 if that vote fails

00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,740
you make another release candidate fix

00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:47,500
what fix the error make another release

00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:51,220
candidate and then repeat vote on the

00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:53,650
dev list again then once you've got a

00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,530
vote that passes you need the incubator

00:04:53,650 --> 00:05:00,070
PMC to vote on that and exactly the same

00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,780
again you need 3 plus 1 votes and more

00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,720
plus 1 the minus 1 but they have to be

00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:07,090
by incubator PMC members now quite often

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,070
you'll get incubated PNC members voting

00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:12,400
on the dev list as well and those votes

00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:14,380
can be carried over it's a good idea to

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,370
mention that in the vote email that goes

00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:20,080
to the incubator list up then if the

00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,190
vote fails on the incubator you have to

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,830
go all the way back to the devil list

00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:27,430
and go through the whole process again

00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:29,830
so you may not get this right all the

00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:33,460
time and it used to be that the

00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:37,420
incubator was a harsh I think is the

00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,890
word on puddling releases in more recent

00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,840
times they've been a bit more forgiving

00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:43,120
if you've got some a few mistakes in

00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,100
there your vote was still likely to be

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,600
passed but you'll be asked to fix it up

00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,600
next time yes

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:53,830
10 the mentors vote on a release yes the

00:05:52,150 --> 00:06:00,880
mentors are considered part of the PMC

00:05:53,830 --> 00:06:04,650
so their vote counts yes that is correct

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,670
and you can either vote in both places

00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:11,950
yeah we'll just say you've carried the

00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:14,010
vote over so yeah so stay to play we

00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:17,290
have 60 Plus projects in the incubator

00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:19,480
we have about 250 incubator P and C

00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:24,400
members not all of those are active I

00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:26,790
would guess mmm I don't know a dozen

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,050
people are very active 50 people

00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:34,720
occasionally pop up on the mailing list

00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:37,720
and argue about something so there's

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,060
about a dozen releases a month and about

00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,710
70% of those releases past incubator

00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:45,220
these are stats from the last few years

00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:47,710
a little recently in the last few months

00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,360
I noticed that some of the releases

00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,440
haven't been voted on as quickly as they

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,090
have been

00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,690
that's mostly because I haven't been

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:56,740
typing on things I think but there are

00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:01,110
other people who vote there's none

00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:03,910
thankfully it's not just me so yeah um

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:07,990
if you need help these are the places to

00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:11,830
go to if you need help with dependencies

00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:14,710
and licensing then go have a look at the

00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,600
legal previously asked questions that

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,740
gets updated on a regular basis so if

00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,650
you haven't looked at it for a while

00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:23,260
please look at it again there is a

00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:25,780
incubator release process which is

00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:28,690
continually in draft and continually

00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:31,480
updated but it has a lot of very good

00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:33,130
information in there and these are the

00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,740
two links there that you should go and

00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:38,170
read and probably the best one to have a

00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:41,920
look at in terms of getting your license

00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:45,460
and notice together is the licensing

00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,620
how-to which is at that link there so

00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,300
please read these these will answer most

00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,940
of your questions if you're unclear

00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,590
about anything on this documentation

00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,720
please send an e-mail to the incubator

00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:58,550
list and hopefully we will fix the

00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,860
documentation for you

00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:07,680
um there's also the Apache maturity

00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:10,350
model this is not policy but it's a nice

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,700
idea and you may want to look at that to

00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:16,470
see how your project is along the line

00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:19,440
to graduation by seeing how it fits in

00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:21,470
with this so a few incubating projects

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,090
do this but it's certainly not required

00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:26,220
there is also the legal mailing list

00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:28,230
archives often searching through that

00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,210
will give you answers to questions like

00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:32,789
if you have can I include this license

00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,229
in in my project you might find that

00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:35,640
that has already been answered it's not

00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:39,750
in the FAQ but it's on the mailing list

00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:42,020
and the same with the legal JIRA that is

00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:44,330
another place where you can you can find

00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:47,970
sometimes fine answers

00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:54,120
um this is roughly how I voted on more

00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:58,230
than 200 releases so 180 of them good 54

00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:01,110
of them now sorry do it again I try not

00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:04,110
to be harsh and I and again I definitely

00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,820
do so in most cases you know try and fix

00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,030
it up next time but there are certain

00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:11,730
things that we look for that really you

00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:15,000
know you've got to do better so there

00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:19,140
here's why I voted - one number one

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,089
reason is binaries in source code the

00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:28,950
Apache foundation

00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:34,380
makes source code we need source to not

00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:37,010
have compiled code in it so that's the

00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,010
most common issue

00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:43,410
licenses are classified by category a

00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,850
category B and category X category a are

00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:48,300
licenses that are compatible with the

00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:50,100
Apache License category B are ones that

00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,340
you can include in binary distributions

00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:56,130
generally and category X is you can

00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:58,260
include them or depend on them at GPL

00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:00,990
where LCBO is one of the category X ones

00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:04,440
and so on ten occasions I've had to vote

00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:06,720
minus one now I do know of one occasion

00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,130
where a release was passed with a GPL

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,200
software in it because they got

00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:11,640
permission from VP legal to do so and

00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,300
they said that we're going to get rid of

00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:17,900
it the next one so even if you think

00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:21,630
that your vote may not pass if you say

00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:25,260
we have these issues and we're going to

00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:27,750
fix them in the next release then that's

00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:30,630
that's a good way to go rather than

00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,070
saying I know though we're not going to

00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,990
do anything about this at all we didn't

00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:37,830
know that was there so quite often if

00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:42,900
you explain things it's more likely that

00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:44,520
your vote will pass them not eight of

00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,080
them include category B licensed

00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,080
software in the source release which

00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,300
again is not allowed and the rest of

00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,130
them are a few things licensing and

00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:56,970
notices issues are generally they're not

00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:59,190
so severe but just in some cases you

00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,410
know it's like that sorry you need to do

00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,270
a bit better than that copyright issues

00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:06,870
have come up a few times or so it's

00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:10,530
included code that Apache couldn't

00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:12,560
distribute or didn't own the IP to I'll

00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:14,940
come to some examples of those later

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,800
missing headers were will header issues

00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,900
if you're missing just a single header

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,190
or so forth your votes going to pass but

00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,930
if you've got a hundred files of the

00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,790
missing headers or it's very unclear

00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,830
what is apache licensed and what is in

00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,780
the patchy license then your vote is

00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:29,580
probably not going to passed and there's

00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:33,240
also some restrictions on encryption

00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:34,890
software thanks to the US government so

00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,690
you've got to be careful about including

00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,620
encryption software in your in your code

00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:49,580
as well

00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:51,530
yes okay so the question was what type

00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,510
of encryption software counts as

00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:57,710
encryption software and the answer is

00:11:53,510 --> 00:12:05,120
I'm not a hundred percent sure I believe

00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:08,210
if it's a like a public/private key type

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,940
encryption thing and it's more than 256

00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:13,070
bit encryption you've got to apply for a

00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,450
license and export license for it but

00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:18,770
the rules are now have changed recently

00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:21,260
so I'm not the US citizen and not on

00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:22,970
exactly what's there the information

00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:25,040
that we do have on the incubator is

00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:27,910
definitely out of date but I don't know

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:32,090
if we've got any one who actually

00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:35,090
authoritative not so the best thing to

00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:37,700
do is if in doubt just go through the

00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:41,750
process of registering it and that is

00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:43,880
documented so if you're using an md5

00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,600
hash that's fine you know there's no

00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,180
problem with that

00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,100
if you're using decrypt yeah you need to

00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,830
do something about it if you're using if

00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,140
you have SSL code you'll have to do

00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:57,580
something about it do you know what the

00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,580
particular example is that you have

00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:15,070
I use oh yeah in some cases of council

00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:16,540
sometimes as it doesn't I think that's

00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,399
what it comes down to it's not that

00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,399
clear-cut

00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,399
sorry

00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:29,510
yes

00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,550
yeah it can be complicated then it's a

00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:42,139
complicated legal situation so but there

00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,300
will be people who can help and there's

00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:45,410
a fallback is that you just say yep I'm

00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:49,550
using it and then you're covered

00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:51,800
basically so um I - one vote it's not a

00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,870
veto so just because you get a - one

00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,690
vote on a release doesn't mean you have

00:13:53,870 --> 00:14:00,260
to do it again it may be that I'm

00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:03,470
feeling particularly grumpy that day and

00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:05,959
it's like no don't like that

00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:07,579
if someone baits - one you can try to

00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:09,440
change their mind

00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:11,570
you can say all right I'll try and fix

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,250
this up in the next release and well you

00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:17,389
might say well it's not so much of a

00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:19,910
problem because of whatever so don't be

00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:20,899
discouraged if you get your release put

00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:24,860
it up there and you immediately get a

00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:26,930
minus one people will also put up

00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,399
conditional votes they'll say okay - one

00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:30,260
unless you fix this in the next release

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,490
and if you say I'm going to fix this in

00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:36,139
the next release and here's the giro

00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:38,060
then good I'll change my vote so um that

00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:39,170
being said if generally if someone votes

00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,779
minus one there's probably a good reason

00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,190
why they did so so there probably is

00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:45,470
something that needs to be fixed there

00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:48,079
and you should look into it and try and

00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,459
fix it in the next release but it

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,699
doesn't have to be perfect the whole

00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:53,959
point of an incubating project is but

00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:55,579
you don't have to get a right trisko

00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:57,800
you're trying to learn this process and

00:14:55,579 --> 00:15:00,440
go through it and you may not be

00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:03,019
familiar with ASF policy while licensing

00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,850
rules or everything at the start our

00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:06,980
policy certainly has gaps in it it

00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,930
doesn't cover everything there are odd

00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:14,449
situations that come up around licensing

00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:15,980
all the time so um just point it out in

00:15:14,449 --> 00:15:18,290
the release candidate if you have

00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,790
something odd in there and you're not

00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:22,010
too sure what to deal with it

00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:24,260
just say okay we've done this this is

00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:27,290
what we thought was the best idea to do

00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:30,290
this if it has no surprises inside it

00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:35,269
that's a good thing right

00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:37,310
make it easy to review people on the

00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:39,160
incubator PMC are volunteers their time

00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:42,180
is limited

00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:45,060
don't make them think too hard about it

00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:47,190
all right provide well-named artifacts

00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:51,270
don't try to be clever licensing more

00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:53,010
headers include compiled instructions in

00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,790
the actual release don't point them to a

00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:57,990
webpage

00:15:53,790 --> 00:16:00,690
I haven't make it easy to compile if you

00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:02,220
can write all of those things we'll make

00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,720
it means is much more likely that

00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:08,880
someone will have a look at your release

00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:11,310
and vote plus one of it now I our

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,560
incubator pn c-- documentation can

00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:15,899
sometimes be confusing can sometimes be

00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:19,260
out of date in recent times actually

00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:20,520
improved significantly i think but there

00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,610
is still a lot of cultural knowledge

00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:25,290
that isn't well documented and the pmc

00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:28,740
is large and has a lot of differing

00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:30,510
opinions on what is correct i think

00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,339
there's mostly consensus about around

00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:35,550
most things but occasion there's a few

00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:37,589
edge cases like in terms of binaries

00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:39,750
inside source releases there are some

00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:41,070
exceptions for build tools and they're

00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,690
sort of a bit of a debate that's been

00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,670
going on recently about what you can

00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:48,570
include in the source release and not if

00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:52,290
it's a built tool often there's multiple

00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:54,240
ways to solve the same issue so i think

00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:56,310
the right answer here is if there's any

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,020
doubt like should I should I leave this

00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:00,839
header alone or should I include this

00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:04,679
header on this file just do so it makes

00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:06,510
it easy and it's it's often by including

00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:09,720
a header that you don't need say an MIT

00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:10,949
license for example you're not making a

00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,079
licensing error it's just a

00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:14,429
documentation error but if you leave

00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:17,189
that license out

00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:21,540
it is a licensing error and it needs to

00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:23,850
be in there so often there's a path that

00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:30,210
you can go down that while it may not be

00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:33,000
a descent correct it's okay so um some

00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:38,350
of the problems I see come from copying

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,090
what top-level projects have done just

00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,130
I'm not saying that any top-level

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,270
projects have done the wrong thing

00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:46,360
because that's not part of the

00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:48,520
incubators responsibility but policy

00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,380
does change it over time and there may

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,760
be historical reasons for why our

00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,580
project is doing something in a certain

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:58,299
way it may not be immediately obvious

00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:59,620
why you know that's happening so just

00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:01,780
take care when looking at top-level

00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:07,539
projects and the examples and don't just

00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:08,830
blindly copy what they've done yeah but

00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:12,210
in particular a couple of big data

00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:14,230
projects but I won't mention any names

00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:20,919
it's a better idea to have a look at

00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:25,570
projects that have recently graduated so

00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:27,880
um one of the other things is that in

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:31,480
order to pass a vote our releases must

00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:36,000
be signed um it's a good idea to use an

00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,000
Apache or email address rather than a

00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:42,539
hotmail address

00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:46,809
okay so I've seen on one occasion you

00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:48,400
know random person 27 at hotmail.com I

00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:51,309
don't know who you are I'm not sure I

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,789
trust this release so use your Apache

00:18:51,309 --> 00:19:00,280
release to sign it make sure you have a

00:18:54,789 --> 00:19:02,470
disclaimer in your release I it's it's

00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,510
not required to actually put it in a

00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:06,400
file called disclaimer it can actually

00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:08,679
be on the website I look through the

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,809
documentation that's what it says most

00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:12,490
common though it's actually put in a

00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:13,870
follicle disclaimer sometimes the

00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:17,909
disclaimers also put in the readme and

00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:17,909
both of those those are falling yes

00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:24,620
yeah yeah this claim adjusters this is

00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:28,790
an incubator project I can't remember

00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:30,590
the exact wording but yeah it's almost

00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:34,970
every single project has one on you to

00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:37,520
take another 100 copy the name okay good

00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:38,900
ideas at AG releases not essential but

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,670
it's a good idea that means you can

00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:44,720
recreate the release at a later date and

00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:46,610
it also means that you can easily

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,470
compare what is actually in the source

00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:54,520
release to what is tagged in github will

00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:57,080
subversion if you using subversion so

00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,990
just one word of caution is that git

00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,490
tags can be edited and changed so make

00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:04,970
sure you provide the hash in the both

00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:06,440
email so that at some future point in

00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,510
time if we ever had to go back and

00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,460
recreate the software from scratch from

00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:16,190
from version control we can double check

00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:18,740
that licensing this is where a lot of

00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:20,270
issues seem to occur um and I think some

00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,830
of it is that most of us are just

00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:24,770
developers and don't really want to

00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:27,500
understand licensing it's just like why

00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:31,550
do I need to know that it's all too hard

00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,810
and conflicts and you know and it's

00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:35,420
certainly a language barrier as well

00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:37,850
even for people who speak English it can

00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:41,510
sometimes be hard to understand what

00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:43,520
something actually means and it can

00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:46,610
certainly be complex and policy can

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:50,360
change over time as well so you do need

00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:51,740
to keep up to date with this um I I have

00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,330
to say though that we're not the only

00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,250
people who have difficulty with

00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:56,990
licensing if you look at open source

00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,600
projects in general

00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:01,250
Apache tends to be a lot better much

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,510
much better on average than some random

00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:07,610
project on github and that can cause

00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:09,950
some problems if you start using stuff

00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:12,950
on github in your own project or from

00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:15,920
elsewhere external projects often have

00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:17,900
unclear licenses they often include code

00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,330
under different licenses and don't

00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:22,250
mention that sometimes they're

00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:25,130
incompatible so you will see a project

00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:26,190
that is licensed MIT but it contains GPL

00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:29,220
code in it

00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:31,440
like that's not good if they are Apache

00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,169
licensed they generally are missing a

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,330
license a notice file which is required

00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:40,080
by a SF policy but it's not required by

00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:41,700
the Apache 2.0 license but that causes

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,220
problems if you want to try and include

00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,269
it in your own own project and some of

00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:50,639
them try to be funny

00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:56,840
don't do that here's one trying to be

00:21:50,639 --> 00:22:07,350
funny um this is from Android um it has

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:09,659
thirty three copies of bsd in it yeah

00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:10,740
it's got I think most of them are the

00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:12,990
same but there are a couple of

00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,799
variations in there yeah

00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:20,309
but it's just like why would you do that

00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:23,879
um here's a check in for a license but I

00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:30,980
don't know if you can read that but it

00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:32,940
is either change the license from um WR

00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:37,860
I'm going to say that what the

00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:42,299
public license - let's do whatever the

00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:43,860
what you want license basically which is

00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:46,620
actually a permissive license under the

00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:48,059
Apache License there was some debate

00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:51,389
about it whether it was actually too

00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:53,159
permissive and doing what you want could

00:22:51,389 --> 00:22:55,470
means you could ignore patents and

00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:56,789
copyright and IP and all sorts of other

00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,919
things but we were decided that it was

00:22:56,789 --> 00:23:02,009
okay and so they had to change the

00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:06,149
license from that - I think it's MIT now

00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:08,190
is see um and yeah because of lintel

00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:14,340
Intel lawyers complained about the

00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:17,100
license it's like yeah whatever yeah and

00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:19,129
that that's the edge forget the tag on

00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,129
it

00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:29,850
this is a nice license and if we got

00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:33,840
this um yeah only dead people can use

00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:38,400
code well sorry I need living people can

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:42,420
be used to code but it's like yeah don't

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:46,290
do this this file is good at the top of

00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:50,490
it we have a GPL at the bottom of it we

00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:54,720
have a BSD how is it licensed I've got

00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:56,520
no idea so yeah as I saying just try and

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,410
err on the side of caution so it's

00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:02,640
better to say if if you're including

00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:04,410
something and it's MIT license that's it

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,610
you know for whatever reason you may not

00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,050
be a hundred percent sure whether you

00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,940
should include an MIT header where we

00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:12,450
include the license information just do

00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:15,480
so anyway worst case it you didn't have

00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:17,070
to include it but that's okay sorry best

00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,870
case is you didn't have to include it

00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:20,730
and that's okay and you know that's a

00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:22,320
minor issue but nothing that can be

00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,880
fixed in the future release but not

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,920
having that MLT license there is

00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:29,670
actually not agreeing with the terms of

00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:31,590
the amount MIT license um so basically

00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:33,690
the whole principle behind this is the

00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:35,490
concept of the universal donor which

00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:37,410
gives anyone confidence that they can

00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:43,140
use our software without any legal

00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:45,510
issues and that's a big thing it means

00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,550
that all software with inside a release

00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:49,500
is compatible with the Apache 2.0

00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,610
license and it means it can be used for

00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:55,350
any commercial and non-commercial

00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:56,820
purposes so most large companies are

00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:59,010
going to get their lawyers to go over

00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,440
everything and you know check it but

00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:02,670
that's them but it it means that you can

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,140
have confidence in using the software

00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:09,750
without having legal risk which is a big

00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:12,330
thing so when you're assembling a

00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:14,160
release there's a guiding principle and

00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:16,560
that is that the reliance and notice

00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,240
files must represent the contents of the

00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,610
distribution that they that they're in

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,500
so don't mention stuff that's not

00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:28,049
bundled

00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:30,779
if you have an external dependency that

00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:32,940
you link to but it's not actually

00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:34,980
included in a source release it doesn't

00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,669
have to be in the license as long as

00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:40,559
it's compatible with the apache license

00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:43,710
so i'm this applies about source and

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:47,630
binary artifacts so your source and

00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:51,480
binary artifacts may actually have

00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:53,370
different license and notice files so

00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,880
that is a common mistake yet question

00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:55,880
back there

00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,049
you can make a dependency file and put

00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:07,020
it in that what you can put it in your

00:26:04,049 --> 00:26:09,090
read me that's good yeah either was

00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:11,669
behind there's no there's no ASF policy

00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:15,330
on on doing that so it's up to the PMC

00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:21,059
to do that however they want not that

00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:22,980
I'm aware of anyway yeah so when you're

00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:25,649
bundling stuff have a look to see what's

00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:30,149
actually inside it sometimes you may get

00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:32,490
some surprises particular look for

00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:35,010
category B and category X software again

00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:41,789
that those categories are listed in the

00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:43,320
legal FAQ look for photos or fonts or

00:26:41,789 --> 00:26:50,220
other resources that you may not have

00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:51,480
permission to distribute now it doesn't

00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,950
mean you have to go through every single

00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,260
file and look at it with a magnifying

00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:56,700
glass you know you have to make some

00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,309
assumptions at some point in time and

00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,320
quite often you know you don't know if

00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:03,899
someone's copied two lines off Stack

00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:07,320
Overflow and pasted it in into your code

00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:09,510
so it's but you know just have a look to

00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,640
see what's actually in there and you may

00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:13,559
find some surprises um

00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,140
one good way to check for those

00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:19,289
surprises is to use rap who hears - the

00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:21,450
rap we users read yeah cool okay

00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:23,309
um it's a good tool for finding binaries

00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:27,179
and licenses in your source release it's

00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:30,210
not perfect it only understands about a

00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:31,799
few licenses and it doesn't find odd

00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:33,299
things like double headers if you've got

00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:35,220
that issue that I showed you before with

00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:59,970
the bsd and the GPL license on it

00:27:35,220 --> 00:28:02,250
want to take that question yeah yeah you

00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,720
may went when you're making making a

00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:05,610
source release you may exclude some

00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,710
things from the source bundle that you

00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:10,020
put in you may put them in there or you

00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:12,059
may complain about things and you put a

00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:14,220
rat exclusion file in there so it

00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:16,230
doesn't complain about them just so you

00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,299
know I generally run rap manually

00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:19,559
without exclusion files so I can have a

00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:22,590
good look at everything because that's

00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:24,780
sometimes the common issue is that the

00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:29,520
exclusion files are too wide and they

00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:31,799
miss things they get put in there oh yes

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,919
so you just be a little bit careful with

00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:37,289
the exclusions so um this is what the

00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:41,190
rat output looks like it's sort of quite

00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:43,200
nice so that's just showing you you know

00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:44,760
what files have unimproved licenses in

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,820
there and whether or not has a license

00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,440
or a notice file and that sort of thing

00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:52,620
and whether or not you've got any binary

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:56,929
files in there and you can see some MIT

00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:59,490
license files there as well

00:28:56,929 --> 00:29:01,110
um there's also this website compliance

00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:03,059
rocks

00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:05,309
it's like rat but give slightly

00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:10,789
different results a good idea to run

00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:10,789
both hello goodbye

00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:16,060
so alright and this is what the output

00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:19,720
of that looks so you are basically

00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:22,210
upload a zip file it compiles it tells

00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,970
you what's there what's not there all

00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:26,530
the rest um this is what I generally do

00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:29,200
I actually use the command line quite a

00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:30,700
lot um if I'm trying to find licenses I

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,140
use this little script here this nice

00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:38,020
little group script and I generally pipe

00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:39,490
it to to sort unique so I get things so

00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:41,980
you just search for common license names

00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:42,910
like GPL vs pmid and that'll generally

00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,730
pick them up straight away

00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:48,460
um also search for copyright and and see

00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:51,910
what that gives us as well so it's not

00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:58,620
perfect but you know it it's a nice way

00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:58,620
of doing it that gives you a hey come on

00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:09,399
um javascript javascript files are a

00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:11,440
pain I'd say that again because the dual

00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:13,029
close JavaScript files are a pain often

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,640
because they're minified and they're

00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:16,929
missing license headers so you often

00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,090
have to then find out what the

00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:21,990
JavaScript files are go find out where

00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:26,110
they're hosted find what the license is

00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:27,820
and a lot of them are not under under

00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:30,190
licenses are not compatible with the

00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:33,220
apache license so you have to be a

00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:35,019
little careful with that also a lot of

00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,820
javascript files the licensing has

00:30:35,019 --> 00:30:38,350
changed between versions so you have to

00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:41,649
know what version you're including as

00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:44,470
well to make it doubly sure so you may

00:30:41,649 --> 00:30:46,659
have to look very clear carefully and

00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:49,380
they also may include other JavaScript

00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:54,490
files either embedded inside them or

00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:56,679
whatever so you need to look at that

00:30:54,490 --> 00:31:00,730
jQuery and bootstrap to that bundle

00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:03,549
other stuff inside them as well um I had

00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:08,169
to vote -1 honor for at least once

00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:10,750
because it had a cat photo in it um it

00:31:08,169 --> 00:31:12,789
was a professional photographers cat

00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,440
photo they just wanted the big photo

00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:16,299
that they could put in there and they

00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,299
liked the picture of the cat um I'm

00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:21,610
sorry you can't do that I didn't want to

00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:23,110
vote minus one on it but you know you

00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:25,630
can't take something that you don't have

00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:28,260
permission to distribute and include it

00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:30,519
in a release so generally what I do is I

00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:33,190
think that let's have a look for all the

00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:34,809
images copy them into a folder and then

00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:35,169
just view those as icons and see what's

00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,179
there

00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:41,289
and then if anything jumps out at me

00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:43,059
I'll try and find out what that may have

00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:44,889
come from and generally a Google reverse

00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:47,080
image search will find it for you

00:31:44,889 --> 00:31:50,549
straight away it's like oh yeah that's

00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:55,419
copyright this guy ah sorry

00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:57,760
so um fonts licensing around fonts can

00:31:55,419 --> 00:31:59,200
be very very complex it's changed a

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,730
little bit in recent years with Google

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,330
providing a whole lot of fonts under the

00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:06,490
Apache License ah but if you do have

00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:09,669
fonts in your release look at the font

00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:12,790
metadata make sure you have permission

00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:17,410
to distribute them um

00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:19,210
and fonts of binary files and it may not

00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:20,830
be immediately obvious how they are

00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:23,710
licensed to someone who's reviewing your

00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:25,360
release so it may be a good idea to put

00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:29,740
that in the license file you don't have

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:32,200
to but that but at least that way you've

00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,790
documented it and no one people don't

00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:38,530
have to keep double-checking that what

00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:39,760
is the license of this font um now the

00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:41,230
licenses that I've been talking about so

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,760
far there's there's certain legal

00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:44,320
obligations you need to comply with like

00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,210
the MIT license says you must include

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,150
the text of this license that's about

00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:52,150
the only restriction that is that it has

00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:56,320
Apache policy adds a little bit more and

00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:59,950
if that is that you must have a notice

00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,660
file and all the licenses must be listed

00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:04,450
in license probably even if they're not

00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:06,490
required but it's not set in stone but

00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:12,640
it's it's it's a good idea to do that

00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:13,840
again from a review point of view so the

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,430
license file is in the root directory

00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,920
and it's either called license for

00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:20,290
license text and it contains the list of

00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:22,300
license of the it contains the apache

00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,980
license and then a list of all the

00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,510
licenses of the bundled software now

00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:28,960
notice it's only the bundled software

00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:30,220
not what you depend on and there's two

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,320
ways that you can do this you can either

00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:35,950
take the full text of the license and

00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:38,020
stick it in there or you can put a short

00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:39,820
form that just has a pointer to the text

00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:43,900
of the license now that pointer is not a

00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:45,370
URL it's actually to a physical file the

00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:48,310
reason that you don't want to put it to

00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:51,990
a URL is that URLs change over time or

00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:54,280
may disappear or may die or whatever um

00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:56,380
license again may be different spore

00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:58,360
source and binary files because they

00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:02,670
have different contents so you need to

00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,670
be aware of that question of the back

00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:12,250
Thanks

00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:16,000
um I had seen that in one or two

00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:18,340
projects it's probably okay but it's

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,870
it's a little confusing unless it's

00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:24,850
clearly marked so sorry the question was

00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:26,470
could I could I just have one license

00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:28,750
file that included all the licenses for

00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:30,520
the source and binary and but clearly

00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,930
mark that one section is for sauce on

00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:39,960
one section is binary and yes that is

00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:44,470
okay so here's a example license file

00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:46,600
and then we had the notice file now that

00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:50,950
contains the ASF

00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:52,440
I believe and it has a year and there

00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:55,210
and you need to keep the year up to date

00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,070
and it only should have what's needed in

00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:59,050
there the reason for that is that anyone

00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:01,210
who uses your software must take the

00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:04,960
contents of their notice file and add it

00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:07,630
to theirs so generally what is only

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,550
required is relocated copyright notices

00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:11,200
so things that have been removed from

00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:15,610
source code that are not no longer clear

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:19,210
any required notices from other included

00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:21,040
apache software and anything else now

00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:23,710
the documentation we currently have

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,050
isn't really clear 100% on what goes

00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:29,710
into a notice file it says all required

00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:32,830
notices other than these things except

00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:37,030
if this it's like that makes no sense

00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:38,260
whatsoever but not much at all needs to

00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,880
go in and notice file is what it comes

00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,620
down to you don't need to list all the

00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,170
copyrights of all the software in those

00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:47,530
file only ones that the headers have

00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:49,960
been relocated from anything that's a

00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:51,520
licensing information should go in the

00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:55,720
licensing file it shouldn't go in the

00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:57,850
notice file so it's generally fairly

00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,800
minimal but it's often where where

00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:04,350
mistakes are well here's a very very

00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,350
minimal notes file here

00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:08,869
so yeah as I was saying with the

00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:12,349
required notices there's some confusions

00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:14,089
a lot of required notices about the only

00:36:12,349 --> 00:36:17,150
thing I can think of is advertising

00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:18,410
clauses and but the issue with that is

00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:20,329
most things that have advertising

00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:24,099
clauses are actually category X so

00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:24,099
you'll never see them in a notice file

00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:30,440
but if there is a required notice you

00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,890
must include a link to the original

00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,869
source oh sorry some category B software

00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:37,430
requires you to have a link to the

00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:39,140
original source and how to get the

00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:41,299
original as a requirement that should go

00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:43,849
in the notice file and some licenses

00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:46,400
require that you must state any changes

00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:48,710
have been made so that would probably go

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,910
in the known as file as well so but

00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:51,470
there's not much that it needs to go in

00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:53,059
there and there's certainly a bit of

00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:55,569
leeway about what gets included and what

00:36:53,059 --> 00:36:55,569
doesn't get included

00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:06,860
yeah yeah some some people have very

00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,860
strong opinions on it though so if you

00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,710
yeah

00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:16,680
so I'm enter the license categories

00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:18,630
before so there's category a which you

00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:21,690
can bundle in your software and you can

00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:23,790
depend on and we'll link to or you know

00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:25,800
whatever it is basically they don't add

00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:28,620
any restrictions above and beyond what

00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:32,520
the apache license 2.0 does so common

00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:35,160
licenses lichens that's a good one the

00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,790
commons licenses include this sort of

00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:40,470
like licenses just grow on you

00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:45,210
current licenses include the Apache 2.0

00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:47,280
license Apache 1.12 clause with three

00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:50,340
clauses BSD without the advertising

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:54,450
Clause MIT or x11 is originally known

00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:58,140
w3c unicode CC copyright only and the

00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:59,880
w2f public license so you can include

00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:02,240
all of those and as long as you mention

00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,280
them in license you're generally good

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,620
category b licenses you can't include in

00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,140
a source release because they contain

00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:15,600
some restriction of use generally they

00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:18,090
vary a little bit by including them in a

00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,040
binary form it means that limited the

00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:22,380
chance of a license corrupting the

00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,090
apache license and that's generally good

00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:27,810
so the common ones you've run into there

00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:30,240
are the CDL the Eclipse license and the

00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:34,790
Mozilla license and Creative Commons

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:37,440
Attribution as well that's only for

00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:39,540
media I believe that Creative Commons

00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,360
what you can't have code that's under

00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:43,980
Creative Commons Attribution so there's

00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,080
there's some restrictions around that

00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:48,260
and then there's the things that you

00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:53,280
cannot include and cannot depend on and

00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:57,390
that generally is GPL LGPL any sort of

00:38:53,280 --> 00:39:00,960
non-commercial license jason jason has

00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:04,350
been recently added because of the do

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,240
good not evil clause which is open to

00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:08,740
interpretation

00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:12,400
there's a foreclosed BSD license and

00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:14,770
possibly the opechee 1.0 license which

00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,380
is sort of a bit odd I

00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:19,420
yeah it's come up a couple of times and

00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:22,240
people have just said we don't want to

00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:23,650
go there but it's by reading and

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,890
understanding of it is that you couldn't

00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:32,410
actually include apache 1.0 in an Apache

00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:34,690
2.0 project um yeah we don't want any

00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:38,290
unexpected binary files in the source

00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:41,049
release so that's no executables DRLs

00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:43,150
jars or class files please you can

00:39:41,049 --> 00:39:47,849
include images you can include fonts you

00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:52,540
can include stuff that is binary but not

00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:57,299
a source code there's a few exceptions

00:39:52,540 --> 00:40:02,079
I've seen releases past that have like

00:39:57,299 --> 00:40:03,520
fake jars for a test like the jar is

00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,920
actually empty it's not really a real

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,869
jar it doesn't really contain code but

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,030
often there's a way around this and that

00:40:07,869 --> 00:40:12,280
is just take the code and compile it as

00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:14,530
part of compiling into the jar as part

00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,440
of the test anyway so just that this is

00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:20,799
generally the number one reason that the

00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:24,369
releases get voted minus one on you need

00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:28,780
to have all the license source file must

00:40:24,369 --> 00:40:30,760
have an ASF header be careful about that

00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:33,849
because the ASF header has changed a

00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,650
little bit over time from the 1.1 to 2.0

00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:37,089
and occasionally i still run into a SF

00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:38,619
headers that have copyright lines in

00:40:37,089 --> 00:40:42,210
them you should not have a copyright

00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:42,210
line unless

00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,220
yes a lot like

00:40:52,299 --> 00:40:57,739
yeah the the question there what a

00:40:54,769 --> 00:40:59,420
clarification I guess was that the

00:40:57,739 --> 00:41:01,670
apache license itself has a header that

00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:03,529
says you should use in your code don't

00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:05,180
use that one that's what we want other

00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:07,789
people to use

00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:08,960
ASF has their own policy and they have

00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:11,450
their own header that you must put on

00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,160
all the quality of your code it's very

00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:16,339
clearly documented though on those links

00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:19,150
that I've pointed to you before um make

00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:21,469
sure that people can compile the source

00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:24,190
have clear instructions on how to do it

00:41:21,469 --> 00:41:28,009
if it doesn't work on a certain platform

00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:29,210
note that all right you don't want to

00:41:28,009 --> 00:41:30,920
have someone spend half an hour trying

00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:35,749
to get it to work on OSX when it never

00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:37,880
was supposed to work on NOFX if you need

00:41:35,749 --> 00:41:39,769
to some setup or you need to download

00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:42,890
third-party components to get it to

00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:44,660
compile write that down make it make it

00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:46,190
easy for someone to be able to review

00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:49,579
your release and you're much more likely

00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:52,279
to get a plus one vote um one of the

00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:53,989
things I've done I'm having to do a few

00:41:52,279 --> 00:41:55,819
more of these but I haven't really found

00:41:53,989 --> 00:41:58,069
the time so far is that I've made in a

00:41:55,819 --> 00:42:03,109
fictional Apache project called Apache

00:41:58,069 --> 00:42:06,140
won back and I've put it up and get up

00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:09,559
and I have step by step text and

00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:11,450
explanation showing how I would make the

00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:13,249
license and notice files and I've also

00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:16,880
made a short video for five minutes

00:42:13,249 --> 00:42:19,309
showing how I did that so it's fairly

00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,849
clear and straightforward you might want

00:42:19,309 --> 00:42:25,099
to go have a look at that and this is

00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:28,789
basically the steps so it's using

00:42:25,099 --> 00:42:30,619
bootstrap and what I do is I get

00:42:28,789 --> 00:42:33,259
boilerplate license and notice files I

00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:35,329
update the notice file to have the right

00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:37,789
copyright you copy

00:42:35,329 --> 00:42:40,660
correct copywriting year now we're

00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:42,619
including bootstrap that's MIT licensed

00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:44,749
notice that different versions of

00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:46,009
bootstrap have had different licenses so

00:42:44,749 --> 00:42:49,069
you've got to be careful with that and I

00:42:46,009 --> 00:42:50,599
think bootstrap Fuller has new license

00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:52,609
as well I have to double check that but

00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:54,680
it does in bundle other things as well

00:42:52,609 --> 00:42:56,569
now so that this will change if you are

00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,930
using bootstrap for versus boot set

00:42:56,569 --> 00:42:58,930
three

00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:03,930
if you have a look at the the contents

00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,070
of the file you'll notice the HTML

00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:07,920
shivers being used

00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:09,930
that's dual licensed MIT GPL if

00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,880
something is dual licensed you take the

00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:14,550
most compatible license so in this case

00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:18,840
I think well we know GPL category X we

00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:20,070
don't want to use that MIT is a

00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,960
compatible license with the Apache

00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:24,780
License so we'll use that and we add

00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:28,440
that to the license file

00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:31,680
there's also respond Jas and query in

00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:34,170
there so it uses those things but

00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,180
they're not actually bundled so we don't

00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:37,830
have to mention them so you don't have

00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:40,830
to add anything to the license file or

00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:42,990
notice file for that if you look inside

00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:46,650
the bootstrap code at some point in

00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:49,380
there it uses normalized KS so because

00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:51,120
that is bundled we do need to add that

00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:54,090
to the license file and that's MIT

00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:55,500
licensed again MIT is a compatible

00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:58,050
license so there's there's no problems

00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:02,040
there and lastly we have some font files

00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:04,560
which are glyph icon now try to find how

00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:06,000
these fonts are licensed is a little

00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:09,990
tricky because if you look at the

00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,520
metadata it actually is incorrect but if

00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:13,710
you go back to the source of where they

00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,810
came from and bootstrap it actually says

00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:19,230
they're licensed under the bootstrap

00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:21,630
license which is MIT licensed so umm

00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:23,700
glyph icon was a commercial product and

00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:26,460
they made some deal with bootstrap to

00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,590
allow for use of their fonts so

00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,550
sometimes you're going to run into

00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:33,230
complexities like that even with

00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:35,730
well-known software like like bootstrap

00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:37,230
there's a few nice to have as well these

00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:39,660
are not required but they just make

00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:41,460
things easy I having an up-to-date

00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:43,260
readme so we know what has changed from

00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:46,620
one release to the next release always

00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:50,400
helps for example if you if you have a

00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:53,100
look complex licensing situation and

00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,180
your last release passed and you note in

00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,700
the readme that there's being no

00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:58,440
third-party files added the licensing is

00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:00,680
going to be exactly the same so you know

00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:03,480
we basically don't have to check that

00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:05,070
list all the changes and make sure you

00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,570
have a case file published so that

00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:09,270
people can actually verify the

00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:12,970
signatures on on your release

00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:15,460
um common mistakes as I said unexpected

00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:17,800
binary files in source releases contents

00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:19,480
of license and notice files the source

00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:22,270
and binary have the same files when they

00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:25,450
should be different not putting the

00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:29,710
release in the correct place less common

00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:31,420
recently but for a while people were

00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:33,400
sticking them into home directories and

00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:36,160
sticking them up on maven and not

00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:39,280
sticking them in the the proper release

00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:43,210
area missing disclaimer is happens quite

00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,950
a bit too surprisingly and missing

00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:46,990
headers as well that's not so common but

00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:49,530
just be careful with the rat exclusions

00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:53,680
and make sure that they're not too wide

00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:56,440
and you know just because it's testing

00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:58,240
code and it's you know it still has to

00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,550
be licensed correctly you need to you

00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:02,380
need to make sure of that

00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:04,090
the other issue with binary releases is

00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:06,190
that they have to comply in the same way

00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:08,440
as source distributions but the contents

00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:11,050
could be different and so you may need a

00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,490
different license and notice file best

00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:15,340
way to do this is to actually look

00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:16,780
inside all the jars that you have in

00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:18,970
your binary list and you can just do

00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:20,290
that with like text editor because

00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:22,150
generally they're just a compressed file

00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:23,920
and you can see all the path names fear

00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:25,330
and if you look at all the path names

00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,130
you can generally work out what's

00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:30,160
bundled and what licenses they're there

00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:32,290
they're under if you make some mistakes

00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,030
for the binary distribution people are

00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:37,390
probably not gonna vote minus one on it

00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:40,390
unless it's really major because they're

00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:42,810
not actually official releases so

00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:45,700
they're provided for convenience only

00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:48,820
it's the source release that is that is

00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:53,080
the more important one so where to last

00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:56,230
I helped ask on your mailing lists ask

00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:57,760
your project menders ask if you don't

00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:01,060
get any luck with either of those our

00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:03,810
incubator and for legal questions asked

00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:03,810
legal discuss

00:47:04,369 --> 00:47:11,670
um every few years this crops up the

00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:13,589
incubator is broken I don't think it is

00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:16,680
I think it works pretty well actually um

00:47:13,589 --> 00:47:20,609
there's room for improvement that's for

00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:22,580
sure and it adds a lot of value for a

00:47:20,609 --> 00:47:28,730
small amount of work for those involved

00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:32,070
it it's quite one of them we had 60 plus

00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:33,630
incubating projects we get through a

00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:34,290
dozen releases a month something along

00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:37,770
those lines

00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:43,920
um it's for a group of volunteers we

00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:47,160
don't do too badly but um if you want to

00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,540
see it another good way to work out

00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,280
whether you might run into problems or

00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,869
not is just follow the list a little bit

00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:54,690
I'm not saying read every single email

00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:57,060
on it and just see have a look at other

00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:59,460
releases and why people voted minus one

00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:00,750
on those and you'll see that that maybe

00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:03,030
some issues that you may have to run

00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:05,700
into um and we can certainly do with

00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:08,910
more help get involved I think one of

00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:10,109
the one thing we are doing wrong is that

00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:12,810
we put paddling's through this

00:48:10,109 --> 00:48:16,320
incubating process and have the people

00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:17,609
that are making the releases they then

00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,830
become top level projects but we don't

00:48:17,609 --> 00:48:21,150
see them again those people who went

00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:23,070
through the release projects are the

00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:25,440
perfect people to review other releases

00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:28,290
in the incubator and currently how its

00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,599
set up is that generally you have to be

00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:33,119
a member to be asked to be included in

00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:35,339
the incubator PMC there are a few people

00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,630
who have done it the other way in that

00:48:35,339 --> 00:48:38,670
they've just turned up on the incubator

00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:40,530
list reviewed a few releases and so

00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:44,640
forth and have actually been voted in I

00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:47,300
think myself and John two people who've

00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:52,220
done that I don't know of any others uh

00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:52,220
so yeah get involved yes

00:48:55,930 --> 00:49:00,490
you're doing it on your left

00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:07,150
last one

00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:07,150
like just because the photos

00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:17,410
on the night of this

00:49:19,319 --> 00:49:26,950
yeah if yeah if you vote on releases

00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:28,869
even though your vote is not binding

00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:31,539
eventually we'll probably vote you in so

00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:32,950
it is binding but it gives a good

00:49:31,539 --> 00:49:34,269
indication that someone else has looked

00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:35,829
at the release and if you find a problem

00:49:34,269 --> 00:49:36,819
then other people are likely to change

00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:38,619
their vote

00:49:36,819 --> 00:49:43,599
well if you say that it's a good thing

00:49:38,619 --> 00:49:44,739
then it's probably a good thing and it

00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,450
gives other people confidence that

00:49:44,739 --> 00:49:48,400
they're they're more likely to vote plus

00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:50,710
one um that doesn't mean that everyone

00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,210
who voted on the dev list like if you

00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:54,960
had 20 people vote plus one on it should

00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:57,969
jump on the incubator and but plus one

00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:00,160
that's another good idea is when you're

00:49:57,969 --> 00:50:02,619
voting on releases actually list out

00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:04,930
what you've checked rather than just say

00:50:02,619 --> 00:50:06,039
plus one like it's like okay I don't

00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:07,749
know whether you just looked at it and

00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:09,579
said yes that's good or whether you

00:50:07,749 --> 00:50:11,160
actually you know got a magnifying glass

00:50:09,579 --> 00:50:14,339
out and had a bit more of a closer look

00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:17,619
so that's a good idea

00:50:14,339 --> 00:50:19,989
um so yeah any ideas on how we can prove

00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:21,700
contact us email us at the general at

00:50:19,989 --> 00:50:23,229
incubated at Apache at all and we're

00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:25,739
happy to talk about it probably a little

00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,739
too much

00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:31,329
Oh so yeah just Apache wrap is another

00:50:28,869 --> 00:50:32,650
tool it's also Apache whisker which I

00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:34,119
haven't actually looked into but it

00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:37,079
looks like a really interesting idea and

00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:39,539
that it describes licences via metadata

00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:41,559
so you might want to check that out um

00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:45,910
it could sort of automate the whole

00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:47,890
licensing thing um it seems like a lot

00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:51,519
of work I have to say and there's almost

00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:53,430
always exceptions that said they I like

00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:56,229
the concept

00:50:53,430 --> 00:51:00,089
um yeah okay so that's it from me

00:50:56,229 --> 00:51:00,089
do we have any questions yes

00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:07,450
battery absolutely successful and

00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:09,850
validated the licenses some does that

00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:12,580
just apply for projects that are

00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:14,890
actually releasing too extravagant like

00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:16,810
the actual project versus just the

00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:19,150
website for the project like yes you

00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:20,800
license validation stuff okay so the

00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:23,470
question was do you have to do license

00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:28,270
validations for the website if it's

00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:29,410
using bootstrap the answer is no but it

00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:31,210
depends whether you include the

00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:34,330
bootstrap code in your source release or

00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:36,610
not if you had a website and your source

00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:38,440
release didn't include the website then

00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:42,850
you wouldn't need to mention bootstrap

00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:44,470
in your source release yeah it is only

00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:46,060
if it's on the rice you can put whatever

00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:51,360
you want on there on your website

00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:53,980
there's no no issues around that yeah

00:51:51,360 --> 00:52:01,020
yeah no no other people's cat photos

00:51:53,980 --> 00:52:01,020
please any other questions yes

00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:09,700
okay so signing of PGP keys you mean

00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:12,340
actually signing a little release

00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:18,430
yourself for getting your key signed to

00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:21,430
become part of the web of trust yeah it

00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:23,770
it's a little complex it is well

00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:25,090
documented though I can't remember the

00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:26,920
URL off the top of my head but there is

00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:29,470
a matching page that goes through step

00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:31,600
by step by step what you have to do and

00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:51,040
ask your mentors for help they will fill

00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:53,080
down well what you can do a couple of

00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:55,660
things with your keys you can publish

00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:58,150
them there's a public server that you

00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:59,680
can publish them to and it may that may

00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:01,780
have already happened and generally when

00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:04,870
you run PGP it will get looked for the

00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:07,180
keys at that server the other thing is

00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:08,800
you make a keys file and you put your

00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:12,730
your public key in that and you

00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:14,700
distribute that with the release so as

00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:16,990
long as someone can get hold of the key

00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:20,440
in one way or another you can also

00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:22,240
attach it to your Apache login in some

00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:24,880
way and it's recorded an LDAP that I

00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:31,270
can't remember exactly what the steps

00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:33,550
are to do that yes okay we are out of

00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:35,070
time so thank you very much for coming a

00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:38,339
look
