	Large Apache Karaf Cluster Using Karaf Cellar and Apache Mesos - Jean-Baptiste Onofré, Apache Software Foundation

Apache Karaf Container is a lightweight micro-services and applications container. Karaf modules provide additional functionalities, especially Apache Karaf Cellar which bring cluster management and synchronization of Karaf containers.

Combining Cellar with Apache Mesos provides an easy way to bootstrap new Karaf containers to provide a scalable micro-services platform.
