anyway welcome everyone this talk is

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:09,090
going to be about it er source 101 and

00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,410
the Apache way that little icon in the

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:15,179
middle between the two feathers is

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:19,140
actually the the official logo of the

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,529
inner source Commons which is a group of

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,240
companies which are trying to

00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:26,580
consolidate information about how we are

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,330
embracing inner source it's actually

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,980
sponsored by by PayPal thank you it's

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,160
actually being sponsored by PayPal right

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,160
now who have been very influential in

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,629
the inner source green realm we're

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,550
looking at actually spitting that out as

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,250
well so if that's something you're

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,770
interested in see me afterwards and I

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,989
can give you the the magic karma to join

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,879
inner source Commons if you're familiar

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:54,559
with the to do group it's sort of like

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,350
the to do group for for inner source a

00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,379
little bit about me I am what his

00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:03,420
affectionately known as a gray beard

00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:06,360
I've been with the ASF Apache Software

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,760
Foundation basically since before there

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,939
actually was na SF back when was called

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,100
the Apache Apache group I've served a

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,220
number of boards I've worn a number of

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,799
different hats and things like that two

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,220
big things I want you two to really

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:26,970
remember is that I'm really at heart a

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:30,619
developer so this is really a developers

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:36,240
look on inner source and the Apache way

00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:38,460
ok so really take that in mind also this

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,439
is my own personal point of view one of

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,920
the great things about the Apache way is

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:47,369
that there are some core tenants behind

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,560
it core beliefs but we all express those

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,479
beliefs differently and so I want

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,520
everyone to remember that this is me

00:01:51,479 --> 00:02:00,780
with with my my hat on as just myself a

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,700
grumpy curmudgeonly graybeard what is

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,409
the inner source ok we're familiar with

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,350
the term open source but what is inner

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:10,410
source well basically the idea about

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:13,400
inner source is that really when you

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:16,400
think about it open source should not

00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:22,239
be successful here it is you have a

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:26,590
project most probably without a known

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:31,040
defined concrete roadmap for example

00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:35,150
with people and contributors distributed

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,930
vastly all over the geography lots of

00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:41,420
different cultures lots of different

00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,829
abilities and things they can bring to

00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,200
the table as far as these communities

00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:48,349
are concerned there's no real

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,239
face-to-face communication really when

00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:53,420
you're thinking about it these kind of

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,250
efforts should not succeed you know

00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,040
because there really isn't that much of

00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,420
an organization above it controlling it

00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,609
which is really when you think of

00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,019
software development how things have

00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:05,599
usually been done right you know you

00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:07,129
were given a set of things to do and and

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,980
and you know given the marching papers

00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:11,989
to do it but what we've really seen and

00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,120
it's been proven you know time and time

00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:17,989
again is that really the way the

00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,940
open-source community works the way the

00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:24,079
open-source community develops software

00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:27,500
has some incredible benefits both

00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:29,780
tangible and intangible but it's using

00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,819
inner source is all about taking those

00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,879
lessons learned taking sort of like that

00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:37,579
that secret sauce of how successful

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,280
open-source projects and how successful

00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:42,680
open source communities work together to

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,290
develop the software in bringing that

00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:48,489
stuff in-house as much as possible so

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:52,239
it's almost in some ways treating your

00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:54,949
internal projects as if they were

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,419
open-source projects and we'll talk a

00:03:54,949 --> 00:04:00,290
little bit about that all the things

00:03:56,419 --> 00:04:01,549
inside there and things like that I see

00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,220
a bunch of these talks from other

00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:06,799
different people and my talk is a little

00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:10,129
bit different because I tend to focus

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,709
mostly on the principles the why of

00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:14,810
inner source rather than the techniques

00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:16,039
oh this is a checklist you should be

00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,900
doing this you should be doing that if

00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:20,090
you're doing that I think that this is

00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,550
the point because the idea behind inter

00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:25,760
sourcing is taking these lessons learned

00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,420
and translating them so they are really

00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,000
really

00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:35,240
effective in your environment if for

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:38,210
your industry so why do people move to

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:41,570
intercept is the draw of using inner

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:44,330
source in today's environment you know

00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:46,280
especially if you are a tech company but

00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,530
even more so what if you're not a tech

00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,470
company I work for Capital One I'm a

00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:54,110
senior director at Capital One a Capital

00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:56,210
One is a bank that is making a

00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,610
transition to a tech company but really

00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:02,620
it really isn't the tech company in the

00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:05,690
same way that IBM and Hortonworks and

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:08,750
Netflix are really you know Amazon our

00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:10,940
tech companies what's the drive well

00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:13,880
first of all is that you want to gain

00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,860
those efficiencies of using the inter

00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,500
source models out there you don't want

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,390
your engineers having to constantly

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,190
recreate the wheel redo things which

00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:24,970
really happens in a lot of environments

00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:28,970
where there are these follow dangers

00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:30,530
inside of corporate IT you know this

00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,450
team is working on that tape on this

00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,250
project this other team is working

00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:36,140
another project and it really isn't the

00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,010
opportunity of cross-pollination between

00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,900
those two

00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:41,050
and it's that cross-pollination which

00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:44,540
helps you realize what some of these

00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:46,940
efficiencies are another thing that it's

00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,580
been proven in the open source world is

00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:52,700
that you really develop software better

00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:55,490
and the software itself is better when

00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,710
you're enabling collaboration between

00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:00,350
teams not only inside the team although

00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:03,290
that's very very important as well but

00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:05,840
if you can go and leverage talents from

00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:09,260
outside that team and allow true

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,690
collaboration you're able to basically

00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:14,480
create a mindset in a view which is

00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,280
beyond that of a particular team that's

00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,010
where innovation comes from that is the

00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,990
power that drives innovation so the more

00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,670
that you can provide opportunities for

00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,010
people who would not only own the

00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:27,740
project but outside of the project to

00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:30,860
collaborate you're able to drive that

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,630
engine of innovation inside there and of

00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:36,070
course you know you're also using it to

00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:38,410
you know standard reduction of you know

00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:41,410
reuse code reuse bringing products you

00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,630
know all this normal typical mom America

00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,920
apple pie kind of things the normal

00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:47,260
things that you think of when you think

00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:50,770
of open-source why do people use open

00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:53,200
source why is open source particular the

00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:55,030
directly map into also what you're doing

00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,890
and the leverages and the gains you're

00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:00,340
having where you're using these open

00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:04,510
source methodologies inside of your

00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:06,940
company itself now since I also said

00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:08,440
this is also about the Apache way we'll

00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:11,800
let's talk about that let's talk about

00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,780
what the Apache way is and basically as

00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,260
I kind of like alluded to earlier it's

00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:22,890
sort of like the the basic tenets of

00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:25,210
what powers the the way the the ASF

00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:27,190
operates it manages and creates

00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:32,260
communities you know that's basically

00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:34,030
what the Apache way is we just look at

00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,070
something yep okay so I'll focus on that

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,690
a little bit later so the Apache way is

00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:40,540
basically like the secret sauce with

00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,860
areas of the ASF now their foundations

00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,140
are their open-source projects have

00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,240
certain governance models the apache way

00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,520
are the basic ones that we have - so one

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,470
of the aspects of the incubator the

00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,470
Apache incubator project if you're a new

00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:55,240
project wanting to come into the ASF one

00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:59,320
of the things the incubator tries to do

00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,120
is to instill these values instill these

00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,790
common thoughts these common

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,210
methodologies this sort of like tribal

00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:10,330
knowledge that that project need to know

00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:12,970
for them to be able to succeed at the

00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:15,790
ASF and so there's some low level basic

00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:18,580
governance principles behind managing an

00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:21,070
open-source project now why do we focus

00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:23,020
on Apache why is a you know in a lot of

00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:26,080
ways and I think other people even

00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:29,500
admitted inner source itself is really

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,469
based on using Apache it's sort of like

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,120
the first model not the only model as

00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:36,580
far as what a successful open source

00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,729
project is the basic one of the tops and

00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:42,580
the reason is because we have this this

00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:45,010
heritage of being able to create really

00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:47,470
really fantastic software projects we've

00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:49,240
had a lot of successes we've also had

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,570
some failures and we've learned from

00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,520
those

00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,740
failures and we have been kind of open

00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:57,340
and upfront about those failures as well

00:08:53,740 --> 00:09:00,610
and in almost in all cases places where

00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:03,760
the Apache Way has failed have been

00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:06,310
places where we haven't really had the

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,800
Apache Way is implemented as possible

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:11,650
for example too much control and

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,720
influence over a project by by a

00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:15,880
corporate entity for example that's

00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,000
something the Apache way is supposed to

00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:22,330
avoid sometimes that stuff sneaks in and

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,280
we've seen in those cases it can be

00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:27,280
damaging sometimes you're able to

00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,290
recover from that damage but in most of

00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:33,130
the cases when we've had failures of

00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:34,390
projects do to do it it's due to those

00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:39,580
kind of issues those kind of problems

00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:43,150
that we see the other thing too is that

00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:46,570
if you're trying to move into inner

00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:49,390
source as a methodology for your company

00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:51,340
chances are very very good that they're

00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:53,560
familiar with open source you're

00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:56,380
familiar with Apache so you also have

00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,970
some you know immediate street credit

00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,100
that hey we're just trying to emulate

00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:02,080
the ASF inside the inside of our company

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,610
that can help you also

00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,770
especially if people are really really

00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,420
hesitant about this newfangled thing

00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,340
called hinder sourcing so again

00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,740
leveraging the power of Apache helps

00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:14,800
bring that inside there so one of the

00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:16,900
origins the Apache way and then we can

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,650
just tell you a small little story you

00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:25,660
know this is basically this the the

00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:29,680
origin of the ASF is that back in 1995

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:31,620
or so there were a couple web servers

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,560
out there that people had businesses

00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:38,470
reliant upon but most probably the most

00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,670
popular by far was the NCSA web server

00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,190
these were the people who not only

00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:46,090
creates a web server but also the web

00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:47,320
browser itself now we were all very very

00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:49,090
happy because there was this one

00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,830
particular person Rob McCool who was

00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:53,500
developing and doing a fantastic job

00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:55,960
developing the web server but he got an

00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:59,980
offer that when Netscape finally you

00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:03,010
know bloomed he moved over so here it is

00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,980
there was a bunch of us in fact a bunch

00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:06,770
of people all over

00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:10,450
a place who are now dependent on a piece

00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:15,290
of software that no one was maintaining

00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:19,220
there was no one behind it we had

00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:22,670
basically hooked our cart onto the NCSA

00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,710
web server and it was driverless it's a

00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:26,600
terrible place to be especially if

00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,680
you're a young business if your business

00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,990
you know focusing on something

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:34,220
especially if you're someone who wrote

00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:37,300
the protocol behind httpd HTTP and you

00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:40,280
wouldn't see it really grow and flourish

00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:44,330
that's a huge void that's a huge vacuum

00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:46,850
that is scary so a number of people got

00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:49,310
together and decided we're going to

00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,470
bootstrap this we will be the horse that

00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:53,060
helps drive this so bailing this were

00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:54,770
put together we started collecting

00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,530
patches and other information and

00:11:54,770 --> 00:12:00,680
basically created what we call then the

00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:05,270
Apache group one of the things behind

00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:08,690
that was that we realized first of all

00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:12,860
how difficult it is to reboot and

00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:15,920
re-energize a dead project the other

00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:20,030
thing is is that we were dependent upon

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:24,800
something that really had no guarantee

00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:26,030
of longevity we saw that we saw one

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,670
person went away and all of a sudden

00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:33,980
poof we were in bad bad shape

00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:36,410
so we swore even though we didn't like

00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,730
all get around the campfire and chanting

00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,790
you know and say this is what we swear

00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:44,030
but you know we swore we would never let

00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:46,010
anyone who used our software be in that

00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:49,670
position again we're going to do

00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:53,090
everything we can to ensure that with

00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:56,930
the ebb and flow of corporate interests

00:12:53,090 --> 00:13:00,290
of developer interests developer time

00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:03,380
free cycles and stuff like that that no

00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:05,710
community that is based on where the

00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:08,540
leverages or consumes or depends on

00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:11,000
Apache Software and Apache project is

00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:13,760
ever left in the same situation that we

00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,250
were it's like the bird hand learns best

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,200
okay wow that's awful we don't want that

00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,380
to happen to anyone

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,410
so you'll see that most of the basic

00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:26,980
things that comprise the Apache way is

00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:31,060
from that era is from that mindset from

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:34,600
the mindset of creating a project and a

00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:37,300
community that is long-term healthy and

00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,579
sustainable and everything else is just

00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,410
how do you do that so some of the basic

00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:43,510
memes and we'll talk about all of these

00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:45,880
you know in particular point the idea of

00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:47,709
meritocracy peer based responsible

00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,570
oversight things like that but even

00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:51,760
looking at this you can say hey okay

00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:55,750
kind of like see how that fits in with

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,100
you know the origin of the ASF at the

00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,880
very beginning let's talk about

00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:04,360
meritocracy I understand that in some

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:10,990
realms the term meritocracy is seen as a

00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:12,970
bad word and for me it's not the term

00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,860
itself which is bad it's what your

00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,810
definition of merit is if your

00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:19,000
definition of merit is dependent upon

00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:22,180
whatever genitalia happens between your

00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,199
legs that's an S subversion of merit

00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,720
okay

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,940
don't play meritocracy for a really

00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,920
really bad definition of merit okay

00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:32,890
really when you think of it think of it

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:36,370
as a duoc recei you know the more you do

00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:39,220
the more karma you know ah cracy caught

00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:41,199
that's horrible but you know how much

00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:44,050
merit do you gauge how much karma do you

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,180
obtain okay well the more you do the

00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:49,360
more we're going to let you do okay this

00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:52,180
is because it's based on what you do as

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,870
a person whatever those contributions

00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:59,560
are not just software it can be code

00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:02,079
evangelism graphics any kind of thing

00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,300
that's merit that helps grow the

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,380
community that's helps improve the

00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,130
project okay

00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:11,050
by proving yourself as yourself we're

00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:13,660
giving you more more things to be able

00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:17,579
to do and so inside the ASF there is

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:22,269
this clear progression that everyone has

00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:25,240
the ability to achieve going from users

00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:26,980
to committers to project members to you

00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,100
know contributors committer

00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:32,260
and even ASF peppers in there and the

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,350
only thing that holds anyone back is the

00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,580
idea of how much do you do well it's

00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,580
really really important about this is

00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,410
the idea that merit never expires and

00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:43,720
again this goes back to the old days

00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:47,280
where we were all doing this as

00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:50,020
volunteers and so sometimes life happens

00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,300
you have a baby something like that a

00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:55,420
job change and you don't have as many

00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,710
free cycles as you had before okay but

00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,910
when you come back you don't have to

00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,950
start at the very very bottom again

00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,780
that's not very very individual

00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,540
contributor friendly no you get the able

00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,750
start off exactly where you were before

00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,240
okay

00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:09,520
same way with with other things as well

00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,650
you want to maintain the definition

00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:15,010
merit that makes it easy for people to

00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:16,390
have their peer base is also very very

00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:19,020
important and another way of looking at

00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:21,850
this is sort of like a very very flat

00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:26,080
organizational structure why this is

00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:27,700
important is because again if someone's

00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,230
been there for 10 years have you've

00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,540
already been there for two months

00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:34,840
there's this idea that I could never

00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:36,850
have as much influence or impact we're

00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,520
be able to drive the community or the

00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:42,310
project as much as that person will

00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,430
because up even if we stay on key I'll

00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:47,590
never pass them as far as years of merit

00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:50,740
or something like that so merit is great

00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:53,260
but it flattens off the idea behind that

00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:56,410
again is to create an environment where

00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:58,750
you're always welcoming new people fresh

00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:02,020
ideas new talents and things like that

00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:04,060
so the idea that there's peer based that

00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:06,610
what you do is based on you as the

00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:08,949
individual and not basically who's a you

00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:11,410
know paying your salary is very very

00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:15,270
very important and again it's one of the

00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:18,850
major things between our our mantra of

00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:22,449
community over code some people call it

00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:24,339
community before code community as code

00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:28,920
or something like that but the idea

00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:32,830
behind it is that if you focus time in

00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:36,550
resources and talent on creating a

00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:39,220
healthy community a healthy project a

00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:40,169
healthy code base simply comes along for

00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,600
the ride it's an app

00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:45,629
roll out flow it's much easier to do

00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:48,809
that and so the idea of poisonous people

00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:52,109
people who might be fantastic developers

00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:54,090
for example fantastic coders but they

00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:55,950
disenfranchise other people they kind of

00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,869
like you really tick people off and push

00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,999
people away or they say you know I

00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:02,850
really don't want to go work you know

00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:04,739
you know contribute code or whatever to

00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:07,200
this project because there's a really

00:18:04,739 --> 00:18:10,230
really nasty people there we really

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,899
don't like that we push poisonous people

00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:15,299
out okay we're really really stringent

00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:16,820
about that and have been from from

00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:20,460
basically almost the very very beginning

00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:23,489
because that is one way of poison the

00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:25,980
community and poisoning longevity of a

00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:28,320
project and the health of a project the

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,590
health of community are incredibly

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,389
incredibly entwined some of the things

00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:36,299
you'll see when we talk about peer based

00:18:33,389 --> 00:18:38,639
you know collaboration is this idea of

00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:40,769
voting the important thing I want you to

00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:43,739
take for you from here is it's not by

00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:46,350
you know it's we use voting basically to

00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:49,379
gauge consensus does everyone feel the

00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:51,059
same way or not okay so you'll see plus

00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:53,009
ones minus ones and things like that

00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:54,419
we don't say add well you don't have

00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:56,879
enough vote to forget it we're going to

00:18:54,419 --> 00:19:00,419
force this change through unless it's

00:18:56,879 --> 00:19:01,230
universal people will stop and say hold

00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:03,869
on for a second

00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:06,299
why isn't there consensus based on that

00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:08,609
again you want it everyone into the

00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:11,940
community they feel just as empowered to

00:19:08,609 --> 00:19:14,429
express their own point of view and this

00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:16,889
provides an opportunity and a mechanism

00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:20,549
for their express their dissatisfaction

00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:22,470
and the ability of the community to hold

00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:23,730
back and say okay well really not not

00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,919
going to just force through with a

00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,779
decision somebody's got an objection

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,299
let's figure out what that without

00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:33,629
objection is and work on achieving a

00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:35,369
collaboration collaborative development

00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:38,129
is also very very important obviously

00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:40,350
everything ASF does is open transparent

00:19:38,129 --> 00:19:42,720
on mailing lists and we'll see how this

00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:45,929
really really ties into to inter

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,389
sourcing as well talking a little bit

00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:51,599
about the responsible oversight in which

00:19:48,389 --> 00:19:53,970
everyone feels personally responsible

00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:58,889
for the software

00:19:53,970 --> 00:20:01,230
okay I may have contributed a patch but

00:19:58,889 --> 00:20:03,870
if it goes wrong sure I feel responsible

00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:05,700
for it I feel really bad about it but

00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:08,220
the entire community the entire you know

00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:11,009
project feels just as empowered to

00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:14,220
change it approve it veto it and things

00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:16,649
like that okay everyone is responsible

00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,990
now look think about about this in the

00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:20,970
normal traditional you know IT

00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:23,250
communities inside your development

00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:25,740
where a developer all I do is develop

00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:28,080
the code when I'm done I throw it over

00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,679
the QA anything screws up that's their

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,019
problem

00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,759
I'm a developer I develop code I don't

00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:35,519
test code you know when it goes to

00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:38,070
production who's that's up you know as

00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:41,399
long as you can maintain that sense of

00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:44,220
ownership of code inside of a project or

00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:46,710
inside your your IT community inside

00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:49,909
your development team inside you know

00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:53,549
companies that that's very very powerful

00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:55,769
so a lot of this is really really on

00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:58,080
this meta you know it's much more about

00:20:55,769 --> 00:21:02,940
community than software and it really

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,529
really is because for me this quote from

00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,870
the author of the of the little prince

00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:10,200
most probably goes to the best way of

00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:13,289
emphasizing what what apache is about

00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,659
and what inner source is about and I'll

00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:18,210
react if you want to build a ship don't

00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:22,049
drum up the men together would divide

00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:25,950
the work give orders instead teach them

00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:30,200
to yearn for the vast and endless sea

00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:31,350
it's that passion developers are artists

00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,000
okay

00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:35,159
think of the words we use that's a

00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,220
beautiful piece of code what an elegant

00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:41,549
solution open source inner source is a

00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:44,730
way of developers to share their passion

00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:49,490
with others if you want to really have

00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:51,809
inner source as a powerful way of

00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:54,000
redesigning how you do development in

00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:57,740
house the first thing you need to worry

00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,899
about is creating a culture of passion a

00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:04,110
personal investment in the project and

00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:07,389
in the code so looking at some of the

00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:09,549
principles of the apache way

00:22:07,389 --> 00:22:11,469
again look some of the principles behind

00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:14,940
inner source and we'll see a lot of

00:22:11,469 --> 00:22:18,190
alignment inside there as I said earlier

00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:21,459
the biggest change and for a lot of

00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:25,089
companies the most difficult change are

00:22:21,459 --> 00:22:27,729
the cultural aspects a lot of companies

00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:30,579
are very very siloed a lot of companies

00:22:27,729 --> 00:22:34,029
don't allow for sharing you know across

00:22:30,579 --> 00:22:36,789
a lot of things culture impacts all the

00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:38,799
other principles of inter source if you

00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:42,279
don't have a culture which is ready to

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:45,940
embrace inter source then you will have

00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:48,129
very very limited success so one of the

00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,779
things to think about before you even

00:22:48,129 --> 00:22:51,999
say ok we're going to do inter source

00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:53,499
and let's open up all our github you

00:22:51,999 --> 00:22:55,479
know enterprise repos so everyone else

00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:57,369
can share it is make sure that you have

00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:59,950
a culture not only among the developers

00:22:57,369 --> 00:23:01,539
but also about among the people managers

00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:04,570
the upper management and things like

00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:07,389
that to allow that to happen don't not

00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:10,209
focus on the culture and one of the ways

00:23:07,389 --> 00:23:13,929
of driving the culture one of the ways

00:23:10,209 --> 00:23:15,639
of redefining the culture is potus

00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:19,419
focusing on some of the principles of

00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:21,519
communication again in most normal

00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:25,509
traditional you know development

00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:27,489
structures it's a team right and it's a

00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:29,529
force team these are the people who are

00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:32,019
required to work on this so the

00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:36,099
communication is just between them and

00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:39,820
no one else in a lot of ways open an

00:23:36,099 --> 00:23:42,369
asynchronous communication is even if

00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:45,329
nothing else open any synchronous

00:23:42,369 --> 00:23:50,499
communication can be transformative

00:23:45,329 --> 00:23:52,839
inside of IT by open we mean that if

00:23:50,499 --> 00:23:54,489
everyone can read it doesn't necessarily

00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:56,799
have to be public of course

00:23:54,489 --> 00:23:58,959
external you know public but by open

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:01,389
means I don't need to receive special

00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:03,339
permission to find out what's going on

00:24:01,389 --> 00:24:05,379
with this team or why these technical

00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:07,479
decisions were made now certainly there

00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:09,639
going to be aspects of code that are

00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:11,679
secret you know again referring to

00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:13,539
Capital One there are things that we do

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,029
that are very very high any you know

00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:18,339
heavily regulated and so those are

00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:20,619
things that can't be publicly available

00:24:18,339 --> 00:24:21,220
to everyone within the company let me

00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:23,110
talk about

00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:24,700
like I mean publicly private or

00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:26,559
privately public whichever way you even

00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:29,919
look at it so they're certainly going to

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:34,030
be the things but that is usually such a

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:36,429
small part of what we do it's much much

00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:38,590
easier to make sure everything open so

00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:40,440
you don't require special permission to

00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:43,270
see what's going on you don't require

00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,080
you know a special tools or things like

00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:46,299
that you know

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,340
oh we're just using hip-hip chat

00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:50,770
everybody else is using slack I got to

00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:53,590
install something else okay make it as

00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:56,830
easy as low Bertelsen as possible for

00:24:53,590 --> 00:25:00,309
people to see what's going on inside

00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:02,380
your project asynchronous is another

00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:04,450
really really important thing and

00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:07,150
especially if your company who has

00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:09,220
bought in heavily on agile with a big

00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:11,200
egg the main thing behind that

00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:15,100
face-to-face communication everyone is

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,620
needs to make a decision on the project

00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:20,350
is sitting right there at the same time

00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:22,360
that really disenfranchises huge parts

00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:24,159
of the company that could be providing

00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:27,820
insight and impact on what you're doing

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:31,059
on so even though you know a HipChat and

00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:32,200
slack and even IRC are beneficial and

00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:33,429
they certainly have their place I'm

00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:37,809
certainly not saying you know get away

00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:40,030
from them rely much more if you can or

00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:42,309
mailing lists I know it's old school I

00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:45,370
know it's great beer I know it's really

00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:48,940
really old and kind of embarrassing but

00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:52,179
it really provides a lot of ways for

00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:54,250
people who have no idea at all what a

00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:56,320
project is doing and what a codebase is

00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:59,320
doing or where decisions are being made

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,950
or how decisions are being made to look

00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:04,750
it up archive it so you use things to

00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:07,360
like you know document what has been

00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:11,110
made but use something which is open and

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:13,630
asynchronous and archivable to maintain

00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:16,120
that tribal knowledge to itself document

00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:19,059
that tribal knowledge which is really

00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:22,090
really important to maintain a community

00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:24,340
that just doesn't live and grow by the

00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:26,049
people who are there right now we think

00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:28,090
how difficult it is you know a lot of

00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:30,760
times to just bring new employees on

00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:33,429
board I mean you know it's such a waste

00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:35,050
of time in a lot of cases because there

00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:36,910
are so many things they need to know

00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:38,830
well first of all if it's if they have

00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:41,170
something they can easily reference it

00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:43,270
makes their job easier it also helps

00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:44,440
them move around inside the company

00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:47,280
which is very very important for

00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,840
employee satisfaction it also helps them

00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,460
contribute back to other aspects and

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,440
other projects inside the community if

00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,390
everyone's operating under the time like

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,100
the same kind of rules so communication

00:26:55,390 --> 00:27:01,360
is very very important this also can be

00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:06,850
can be very very scary any questions so

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:08,590
far pretty good coal transparency is is

00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:12,430
also very very different and I think one

00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:17,860
of the one of the best ways of thinking

00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:21,090
about transparency is open in public

00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:25,420
means that you can see a restaurant

00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:26,740
recipes transparency means that you can

00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:29,590
look inside the kitchen when they're

00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:31,900
cooking very very different thing this

00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:34,690
really lets you see exactly what's going

00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,310
on we're going to be very transparent

00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:38,320
about our decision making processes

00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:41,230
we're going to make sure that people are

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,240
able to to see exactly what's going on

00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:46,420
and it's only by really having

00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:50,560
transparency that you can really enable

00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:53,230
reuse if people can't find what's out

00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,910
there if it's not transparent on what

00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:56,980
the aspects of this particular project

00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:58,210
are supposed to do then chances are very

00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,310
good people will be able to reuse it

00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:02,110
because they won't know all the ins and

00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:05,830
outs of it they won't know the dirty

00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:07,750
little development knickknacks that have

00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:11,020
gone into making it operate this

00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:13,330
particular way you know another thing is

00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:16,540
by having things incredibly transparent

00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:18,340
you've got multiple I syndrome more

00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:20,170
people are able to look at the software

00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,820
project more people to be able to look

00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:24,390
at the code you're going to get better

00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:27,340
security better better better

00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:28,840
constructed a software it just results

00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:31,590
in the kind of things that we normally

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,600
recognize in the open-source world

00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:37,410
another very very important thing is is

00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:40,900
the the second to last bucket is that

00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:44,350
you really can't measure what you can't

00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:47,380
see you know lack of transparency can

00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:48,850
hide a lot of nastiness a lot of

00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:51,850
inefficiencies that are go

00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:54,220
inside your development can also expose

00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:57,130
a lot of really early fantastic

00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:59,290
successes and when you first start

00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:00,850
getting into inner source one of the

00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:02,800
biggest things that people are going to

00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:05,380
be interested in and concerned about is

00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,390
how do I know if I'm being successful

00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:10,330
how do I know that my inner source

00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:12,730
efforts are realizing the efficiencies

00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:15,070
we want well if you don't have an

00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:16,990
environment set up for transparency in

00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,770
the first place that you're not going to

00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,750
be able to measure that

00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:21,460
it's going to ear it's a self defeating

00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:25,030
purpose you just simply won't get that

00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:27,640
so the idea that transparency is not

00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:29,650
something to be scared of it's not

00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,590
something to avoid that transparency is

00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:34,540
something to be embraced again you can

00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:37,330
see how in a lot of cultures that would

00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:39,940
be very very tricky that's a major

00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:42,070
change but it also needs to be something

00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,630
that to really benefit from inner source

00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,910
there needs to be aspects of

00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:47,530
transparency and again this is not an

00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:50,070
all-or-nothing the reason why I try to

00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:53,380
focus on the principles behind the

00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:54,970
reasoning behind it it's because when

00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:57,970
you start bringing inner source in-house

00:29:54,970 --> 00:30:00,610
you can start figuring out okay this

00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:03,070
level of transparency is good enough for

00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:06,700
this particular area okay using this

00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:08,560
technique to ensure transparency works

00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:11,020
for this team but not for that team so

00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:15,100
you can pick and choose okay don't feel

00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:18,010
as if you know a failure for lack of a

00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:19,840
term to the fully embrace all aspects of

00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:21,850
this means that you can't leverage inner

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,560
source these are just sort of like the

00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:26,320
wish list of how everything else is

00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:29,860
great but think again about the reasons

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:32,620
behind transparency and then focus on

00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:35,620
how can we implement this how can we

00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:39,610
reinforce this culture inside of our

00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:41,680
community collaboration you know is

00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:44,590
another obvious thing about inter

00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:47,380
sourcing with inner source you want to

00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:50,170
enable other teams outside of that silo

00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:52,360
to contribute back to collaborate back

00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:55,180
and again you can see how things like

00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:57,730
email lists and stuff like that fosters

00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:59,530
a sense of collaboration but it also

00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,810
means that you're creating an

00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:03,530
environment

00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:07,650
where they now share a common vision

00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:10,710
common goals common tools there is the

00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:13,650
sense of we are not just a separate team

00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:17,520
working on a separate project we really

00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:21,600
are a organization marching in a very

00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:25,620
very similar direction and I see where

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:29,040
my part fits in I also see how I can

00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:30,900
help other aspects where my natural

00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,550
talents or my natural inclinations would

00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:35,430
be you know helpful to prove in that

00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:38,760
side there so collaboration is all about

00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:41,670
creating this environment where they are

00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:43,050
feel again sorry for the buzzwords but

00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:45,120
they really are some applicable you know

00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:48,480
they feel empowered to be able to work

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,520
with other teams you know and also they

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,230
realized that by collaborating with

00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:55,020
others we really are going to be

00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:56,850
respected and rewarded inside of that

00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:59,810
now some of the techniques behind this

00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:04,340
and I really really like these is that

00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:06,750
too many cases it's very very difficult

00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,460
both the open source projects and

00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:11,610
especially project which are inside

00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:15,150
inter source for new people to come on

00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:17,990
board ok they can go and make a pull

00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:21,930
request very very easy but how do I know

00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:24,570
that what I want to contribute doesn't

00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:27,000
break your builds break your environment

00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:29,070
so what I like to do is say you know if

00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,140
you're an internal project who wants to

00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:33,690
get inner source take some time and

00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:37,050
resources to create building test tools

00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:39,870
ok make sure that magic is no longer

00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:41,760
magic so that way when there are people

00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:43,710
who are ready to contribute they've

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,310
already built the software for

00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,020
themselves

00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:48,420
they've already tested it to make sure

00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:51,090
there's no regressions on what your

00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:53,910
expected behavior of the software is but

00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:57,210
what their expected software is again

00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:59,820
too many developers nowadays short shift

00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:01,770
that you know or say you know building

00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:04,890
and testing that somebody else's problem

00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:07,950
ok that really means that no one can

00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:10,560
really contribute back because you can't

00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:13,860
QA something that is an even part in the

00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:14,020
official codebase anymore so stress you

00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,670
know

00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,950
making the kind of building test tools

00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:19,630
another way of doing it is that and you

00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:22,420
see this a lot on open source projects

00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:23,890
is that look to the low-hanging fruit if

00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:26,380
there are issues inside your inner

00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:29,560
source project that would be relatively

00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:32,230
easy for new people to to come on board

00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:35,380
and get their feet wet as it were tagged

00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:37,480
nose as newbie issues or low-hanging

00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:40,240
fruit or something like that so people

00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,560
can really really quickly and easily go

00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,660
out okay well this looks like something

00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,940
that might not be too difficult it's got

00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:47,560
some real marriage I'll work on this and

00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:50,380
especially good if there's somebody

00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:53,170
who's a mentor you know we'll talk about

00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:55,660
you know you know merit and things like

00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:56,980
that a little bit later on a mentor but

00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:59,260
somebody who would be available to help

00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:01,630
them out again you're creating a culture

00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:04,870
here an environment in a community and

00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:06,700
those things really really help out so

00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:11,409
the whole idea behind that is to create

00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:13,780
this sense of community inside their you

00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:16,840
know community breeds loyalty you know

00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:19,929
it really has significant impact for

00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:23,620
employee retention as well as employee

00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:25,600
hiring if people can move from the

00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:27,580
environment where they you know really

00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:30,820
enjoy contributing to open source and

00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:33,820
they can move into a company environment

00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:35,679
which those sort of like what's

00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:38,530
important to you the culture behind that

00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,060
is the same they want to make that

00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:42,460
transmission they want to work for a

00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:43,870
company that gets it they want to work

00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:47,800
for a company that appreciates what they

00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:49,630
do and doesn't stifle them put them in a

00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,390
silo and says you can't work on anything

00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:54,669
else unless you decide to you know

00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:56,200
relocate or okay well you're not with

00:34:54,669 --> 00:34:58,480
this team anymore you want to move

00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:01,000
somebody else so it really has a large

00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,500
impact in maintaining really really good

00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,720
developers that's the other thing as

00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,010
well it's not only retaining people but

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,080
you're retaining the kind of people that

00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:12,100
you want to retain really really

00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:13,900
energize engage talented developers you

00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:16,300
know everyone has something they focus

00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,920
on but then that itch gets you and you

00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,840
want to work on something else and if

00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,770
you can provide an opportunity for them

00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:25,150
to scratch that itch inside your company

00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:26,830
they're going to stay and they're going

00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:29,620
to really put forth as much as they can

00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:33,040
so really focus on when the whole idea

00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:35,410
of a community their aspects of

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,010
measuring the health but also keep this

00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:38,290
thing going

00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:40,000
it's not a done deal okay we've got a

00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:40,630
community you've got to keep on working

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,560
at it

00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:46,660
and finally there's the whole idea of

00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:48,280
meritocracy and this is really goes into

00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:51,160
great when you start talking about

00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,560
people managers and middle managers why

00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,800
this makes sense because the idea is

00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:59,050
that your best employees your best

00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:01,900
contributors will bubble up it'll be

00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:04,420
impaired it - they are okay not only is

00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:06,970
that great because it provides them the

00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:07,780
incentive for bonuses promotions and

00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:10,120
things like that

00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:13,810
but it also provides you the opportunity

00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:15,730
to leverage their talents in mentoring

00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:18,070
other people because the people who

00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:20,920
bubble up with high merit are also the

00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:23,710
kind of people that in general people

00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:26,920
want to emulate and so provide them the

00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:30,100
opportunities to do that inside webinars

00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:32,170
and tech talks you know allow them to go

00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:35,800
to conferences and things like that

00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:38,560
these are sort of like the intangible

00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:40,570
but intrinsic aspects of gaining merit

00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,210
you have to have some sort of Merit

00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:44,800
level inside your company to really

00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:47,350
engage inner source because at the end

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,380
of the day people say well what's it for

00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:53,140
me what's the path what will I gain by

00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:55,750
contributing back by doing more than I

00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:57,490
should yeah I like scratching the edge

00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:01,180
but at the end of the day this is also

00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:03,010
work and managers will say what what

00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,570
good is them you know working on

00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:07,060
something else I want them focused right

00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:09,400
here so having a marriage structure a

00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:11,440
rewarded known company-wide married

00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:14,020
structure helps alleviate both of those

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,020
concerns because now managers and

00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:19,570
developers can see the benefits of

00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:21,910
engaging truly engaging in their source

00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:23,770
projects inside the community out there

00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:27,360
so make sure there's the you know those

00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:32,260
rewards those potentials are well known

00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:34,600
and finally some some initial but final

00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:37,510
thoughts about it a community it's not

00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,280
the same as a team and that's a really

00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:40,929
really important point a team is

00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,769
something which is a sign

00:37:40,929 --> 00:37:47,289
a community is something which is

00:37:43,769 --> 00:37:50,259
self-aware self acknowledging we are a

00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:52,809
community I'm part of a team we are

00:37:50,259 --> 00:37:54,669
community again it draws back to the

00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:57,279
idea that what we try to do is create a

00:37:54,669 --> 00:38:00,400
culture inside into the control has to

00:37:57,279 --> 00:38:02,499
be one of a community rather than a team

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,779
it is self-organizing it is self

00:38:02,499 --> 00:38:07,749
identifying it goes back to that to that

00:38:04,779 --> 00:38:09,669
quote about the ship is that you don't

00:38:07,749 --> 00:38:11,859
need to tell them what to do there will

00:38:09,669 --> 00:38:14,019
be ten steps ahead of you knowing what

00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:16,869
they do because their passion is in

00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:19,869
getting this this project is code based

00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:22,869
this deliverable out and ready okay

00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:24,910
contribution is work it really really is

00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:27,669
work and it needs to be rewarded and

00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:29,769
acknowledged as such by managers but

00:38:27,669 --> 00:38:36,279
also with fellow employees and things

00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:37,660
like that another thing is that inter

00:38:36,279 --> 00:38:40,059
source is not something that you can

00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,529
just say ok we're doing Intersolar

00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:44,319
we're done we're going to implement all

00:38:41,529 --> 00:38:47,169
the stuff it does take time and

00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:48,699
resources and effort to create an

00:38:47,169 --> 00:38:51,699
environment where all these things

00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:53,529
happen if you think of a garden yeah you

00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:55,449
can most probably take a plot of soil

00:38:53,529 --> 00:38:57,189
and throw some seeds down and you might

00:38:55,449 --> 00:39:00,789
get some seeds out there but you have

00:38:57,189 --> 00:39:02,890
much better luck if you you you tend the

00:39:00,789 --> 00:39:06,249
soil first if you actually do something

00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:08,349
to prep the soil the garden for what it

00:39:06,249 --> 00:39:09,819
is you're trying to grow and so really

00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:12,039
you'll need to be able to do that I

00:39:09,819 --> 00:39:13,959
mentioned one which is the idea that

00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:15,939
you're needed going to have you know

00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:17,859
building test tools available what you

00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:20,049
may not not have or may not be

00:39:17,859 --> 00:39:22,179
accessible to the people that you want

00:39:20,049 --> 00:39:23,949
them to you know to be able to have

00:39:22,179 --> 00:39:25,689
access to that so that would be

00:39:23,949 --> 00:39:26,979
something you would need to change so

00:39:25,689 --> 00:39:30,189
don't think that this is something that

00:39:26,979 --> 00:39:32,709
you can just wave a wand and do it will

00:39:30,189 --> 00:39:34,719
take some time and resources and again I

00:39:32,709 --> 00:39:36,669
encourage people that if you are

00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:39,130
interested in doing this join the inner

00:39:36,669 --> 00:39:40,630
source Commons because you know we're

00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:42,729
all doing this we've all in various

00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:44,199
stages of doing this we can help people

00:39:42,729 --> 00:39:46,329
with what works and what doesn't work

00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:48,880
what's also nice about the inner stores

00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:50,949
Commons is that we operate under what's

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,359
called Chatham House Rules which

00:39:50,949 --> 00:39:53,740
basically means you get to share

00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:55,810
information but

00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:58,150
you can't assign that information to any

00:39:55,810 --> 00:40:00,640
particular person or company so provide

00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:03,010
some an amenity inside there you know so

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,260
you don't have to worry about you know

00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:08,130
sensitive information leaking out or oh

00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:10,750
this is how you know fubar is doing it

00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:14,340
so it's very very private but it's a

00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:16,450
great way of sharing sharing information

00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:18,550
another thing and this is really really

00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:20,410
important one of the things that I'm

00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:22,090
really have been working with capital

00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:24,190
wanted out and they're really really

00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:27,640
getting it is the idea that transparency

00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:30,670
is not a threat again own culture is

00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,170
very very much about wow you know we

00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:34,990
need to really limit the amount of

00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:36,490
information that our employees see the

00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:38,110
other team see and things like that

00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:40,420
because there is that you know that

00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:42,100
sense of okay this is this is our stuff

00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:45,610
I don't want anybody else messing around

00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:47,500
with it or you know what happens if you

00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,730
you know if you know somebody else

00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,890
starts working around with it am I going

00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:53,050
to lose a job that kind of stuff is

00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:56,290
really really scary the best thing to

00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:58,540
you know get rid of that is being very

00:40:56,290 --> 00:41:00,760
transparent about doing what's going to

00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:03,160
happen nobody's losing a job what we're

00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,140
doing is making the best way the best

00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,990
use of people's talents and things like

00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:10,900
their that's it for actual you might

00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:13,420
talk this is some contact information

00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,980
for me I wanted to thank fill sites who

00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:18,250
I thought was going to like be in here

00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:21,430
you provided some some insight on the

00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:23,380
principles of inter sourcing as well my

00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:24,300
slides are always going to be uploaded

00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:27,520
they're going to be up there on

00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:29,980
SlideShare if you need to contact me for

00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,300
any reason I'll be here for the rest of

00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:35,500
the conference that's my contact

00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:36,609
information as well and anything I can

00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,350
do to help just let me know

00:41:36,609 --> 00:41:40,330
like I said inter-service calmness is a

00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:42,100
great resource this is something that

00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:44,619
I've been driving a lot inside of

00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:47,980
Capital One I see this as sort of like

00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:51,010
the the longtail of open source this is

00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:52,780
heard like the final final result of the

00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:54,640
open source revolution you know we've

00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:56,410
got the external world doing it now

00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,690
let's bring this stuff in-house and

00:41:56,410 --> 00:42:01,060
really continue the energy that really

00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:02,680
drove open source by having companies

00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:05,530
really really embraced not only by

00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:07,360
leveraging and consuming and being good

00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:10,030
open-source community member

00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:17,590
is that actually practicing it in else

00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:21,420
thank you any questions we have a couple

00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:21,420
minutes yes

00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:34,900
okay okay the question was what kind of

00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:36,700
projects do I push to be inter source in

00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:39,010
their company first of all I don't try

00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,839
to push anything it's got to be

00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:43,359
something that people willingly want to

00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:45,700
do if there are push backs between if

00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,569
there are projects that do not want to

00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:49,000
be inter source

00:42:46,569 --> 00:42:50,799
you can't whip some inter source on them

00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,339
it's just not going to succeed it's not

00:42:50,799 --> 00:42:56,019
going to happen

00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:59,200
for me I try to find projects which are

00:42:56,019 --> 00:43:02,859
as generic as possible that would have

00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:05,559
as well as wide range of potential

00:43:02,859 --> 00:43:09,190
contributors as possible the things like

00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:10,779
you know libraries frameworks messaging

00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:13,210
systems the kind of things that

00:43:10,779 --> 00:43:15,339
everybody needs a part of and everybody

00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:17,470
is doing everybody is recreating it here

00:43:15,339 --> 00:43:19,510
everybody is recreating it there it's

00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:22,750
much better to try to use those prices

00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:25,059
to consolidate things so a big you know

00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:27,940
a good thing would take an inventory of

00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:29,740
what your teams are doing look at where

00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:31,359
places could be shared there are a lot

00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:34,480
of companies now who actually have like

00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:36,220
a shared mantra that you know there's

00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,079
needs to be one particular space but

00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:41,470
look at places where you're seeing a lot

00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:43,420
of places that there could be reuse but

00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:45,609
isn't reuse or places where they're

00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:47,470
talking about reuse but they're not

00:43:45,609 --> 00:43:49,089
really letting anyone contribute back

00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:51,549
that's another you know that's a great

00:43:49,089 --> 00:43:52,960
place to really start throwing some

00:43:51,549 --> 00:43:55,720
inter source inside there there are a

00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,910
lot of you know project which you know

00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:59,799
we're a shared library we provided for

00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:02,170
you yeah I knew this feature will code

00:43:59,799 --> 00:44:04,660
it for you that really doesn't work out

00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:06,369
well it doesn't scale well either and

00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:08,440
there's always a miscommunication

00:44:06,369 --> 00:44:10,539
between what they want and what actually

00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:13,269
gets delivered it's so much better so

00:44:10,539 --> 00:44:15,670
much more efficient you know it just

00:44:13,269 --> 00:44:17,259
works so much better to actually give

00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:19,450
them with the permission to contribute

00:44:17,259 --> 00:44:21,339
code but also provide the tools they

00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:22,630
need to be able to ensure that what

00:44:21,339 --> 00:44:24,220
they're doing isn't breaking things

00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:28,140
works for their environment and stuff

00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:28,140
like that yes

00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:38,550
the question was if you have contractors

00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,640
involved does that change the complexion

00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:42,720
of things and it really really doesn't

00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,830
the other you know one of the things you

00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,600
need to worry about is make sure that

00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:49,380
whatever agreement you have between the

00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:52,590
contractors is okay because chances are

00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:56,420
good another thing I could have

00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:59,520
mentioned is that a lot of businesses

00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:01,980
before they open source a project they

00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,690
inner source them you know they actually

00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:07,260
started you know working and developing

00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:08,820
the project in an inner first fashion so

00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:10,680
when it's time for them to open source

00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:12,030
it they already have the culture down

00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,890
they already know how to work with the

00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:15,120
community because they kind of been like

00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:17,190
they're working with an open source

00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,600
community already it's just been inside

00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:21,630
the company and now you're embracing

00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:23,010
their larger company out there so and so

00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:24,870
in that way you also need to worry about

00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:27,090
you know if there's a possibility that

00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:29,820
whatever is being you know contributed

00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:33,060
by a contractor can be open source but

00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:35,100
in general I think it really again makes

00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:37,410
the contractors job easier because what

00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:40,650
you're trying to do is is is get away

00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:42,750
from this us-versus-them mentality okay

00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:44,070
we're the team behind it and you're the

00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:45,570
helper you're the contractor you're

00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:47,160
something like that you know that

00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:49,530
doesn't work that's what you're trying

00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:52,860
to break down and so by your if you have

00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:55,200
an inner source environment you're not

00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:57,090
seen as somebody external you're seen as

00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,520
somebody who's really contributing back

00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:02,130
and collaborating with the team rather

00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,170
than just somebody who's doing work and

00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:08,300
throwing yourself in their lap so it

00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:08,300
makes your job a lot easier yes

00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,979
[Music]

00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:26,040
right yes

00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:29,970
the question the point was that there

00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:32,609
are some crafty ugly kind of stuff that

00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:35,100
you just have to do because it's a job

00:46:32,609 --> 00:46:37,200
it's a word it's work and that you know

00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:39,030
expecting people would just naturally

00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,119
whistling and gravitate towards doing

00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:42,720
something which is ugly and stupid work

00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,640
at the end of the day it's still

00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,400
business right I mean you still have

00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:49,340
teams that are required to create

00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,720
something and they're not going to be

00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:54,630
maybe as happy to do that

00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:57,840
but if they know that they also have the

00:46:54,630 --> 00:47:01,130
opportunity to sort of like cleanse the

00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:03,900
palate with with inter source projects

00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:05,580
they'll be much more happy to be able to

00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,710
do that sort of like you know grunt work

00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:11,490
that nobody needs to do it provides that

00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:13,560
opportunity you know to to get around

00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:18,590
that so they're not as bored as they

00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:18,590
would normally be yes

00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,980
the question was what do you look at

00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:31,110
since the transparency was so important

00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:33,030
what do you look at that's a great

00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:35,970
question that is actually something that

00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:39,570
the inner source community is presently

00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:41,250
kind wouldn't say struggling with but

00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:43,770
we're trying to come up with what

00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:45,570
exactly those things are you know there

00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:48,290
are of course the simple metrics as far

00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:50,820
as you know contributions from outside

00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:52,680
you know at side teams outside you know

00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:56,000
groups and things like that which

00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:59,190
provides some insight to that but as

00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,580
with all things it can be gained very

00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:06,050
very easily you know so if the eye

00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:08,730
depends on what you want something so

00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:12,780
yeah I'm kind of like you know going

00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:14,730
about 150 right now up there so so it is

00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:16,350
a problem it is not a problem no it's

00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:18,750
not a problem it's something that we are

00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:24,030
working at trying to help define and

00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:25,980
there are certain metrics that work in

00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:29,700
some situations in some environments

00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:31,530
that don't again I think that easiest

00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:33,180
and quickest answer would be is that's

00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:35,850
the kind of stuff that we're trying to

00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:38,090
come up with at the inner source Commons

00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:42,650
is to come up with sort of like a a

00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:47,430
mutual agreement mutual methodology of

00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:49,650
how to really gauge inner source success

00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:52,890
in a transparent environment inside

00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:55,470
there the you know there are normal

00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:57,000
metrics but you really want something a

00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:59,520
little bit with a little bit more meat

00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,080
behind it to really help engage we're

00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,619
really really earlier on this transition

00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:06,869
so those kinds of things are things that

00:49:03,619 --> 00:49:08,550
we will we will define you know as time

00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:10,619
goes on is when people you know come to

00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:13,770
the forefront and start engaging inner

00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:15,960
source then it sort of like the it'll

00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:20,090
become apparent what real ways about

00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,090
doing that are sure

00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:27,329
businesses are

00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:39,950
yeah the question was are things like

00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:44,089
employee retention employee have

00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:45,349
happiness good metrics certainly Capital

00:49:44,089 --> 00:49:47,869
One that's that's what we've been

00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:50,210
looking at is is that you know are we

00:49:47,869 --> 00:49:53,510
able to obtain the kind of talent that

00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:55,880
we want to obtain are we able to keep

00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:57,710
the amount of talent that we are Capital

00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:00,230
One is a very very young company as far

00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:03,349
as moving into the IP space we've only

00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:05,780
really been you know hiring developers

00:50:03,349 --> 00:50:09,020
and engineers from maybe the last three

00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:10,220
three plus years or so and so it's right

00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:13,430
around that time that developers get

00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:14,960
itchy you know you know and so we're

00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:17,510
looking at those numbers you know

00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,789
engaging our success one admittedly our

00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:22,089
very early entry into inter source but

00:50:19,789 --> 00:50:25,339
those are some very very good metrics

00:50:22,089 --> 00:50:30,230
you know looking at developer happiness

00:50:25,339 --> 00:50:31,549
looking at you know if you're seeing you

00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:33,170
know the individual contributor

00:50:31,549 --> 00:50:35,299
community inside your company kind of

00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:37,460
like self-organizing if they own their

00:50:35,299 --> 00:50:38,839
own decide you know what I need to you

00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:41,329
know talk more and have more

00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:42,829
opportunities for for webinars and

00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:46,819
sharing information and stuff like that

00:50:42,829 --> 00:50:49,099
that also are some intangible inferences

00:50:46,819 --> 00:50:51,829
that definitely mean that it's becoming

00:50:49,099 --> 00:50:53,690
a success so that president right now

00:50:51,829 --> 00:50:55,579
it's more of those kinds of things that

00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:58,640
weren't coming those gut feelings

00:50:55,579 --> 00:51:00,170
tempered by we're not losing people

00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:03,619
we're getting great people those people

00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:07,099
are refereed or asking their friends to

00:51:03,619 --> 00:51:12,740
to also come on board that really helps

00:51:07,099 --> 00:51:15,470
show that it's exceeding anything else

00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:20,650
no I

00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:20,650
oh yes three times no problem

00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:44,090
we are right so he said of course stick

00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:44,090
right that's family controlled by

00:51:50,109 --> 00:51:53,829
here's where you are

00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:04,260
yeah it was a long question I don't

00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:07,829
think I could repeat it but basically it

00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:09,990
says that in the open-source community

00:52:07,829 --> 00:52:12,539
you have a lot more freedom and

00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:13,740
flexibility than you do as employee as

00:52:12,539 --> 00:52:15,119
far as like voting with your feet

00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:15,480
running off I'm going to do something

00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:17,130
else

00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:20,789
whereas you really can't do that that

00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:23,160
much at work what you will find and what

00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:27,750
I've seen in a number of companies is

00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:30,539
that when the community itself of

00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:32,670
developers feel is if their happiness

00:52:30,539 --> 00:52:35,039
and their collaboration and their

00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:37,740
ability to collaborate is being

00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:39,289
threatened by a poisonous person where

00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:42,390
something different

00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:44,130
management is aware of that very very

00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:47,400
quickly certainly much more quickly than

00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:50,549
would ever be if there wasn't that

00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:53,520
transparency because not owning is that

00:52:50,549 --> 00:52:55,799
person being a pain for that particular

00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:58,230
team but because there is this level of

00:52:55,799 --> 00:53:00,809
transparency lots of people are knowing

00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:04,890
that you know he or she are being being

00:53:00,809 --> 00:53:07,500
a pain and so it actually addresses that

00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:09,420
situation there might be times you know

00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:11,039
of course where you know the company

00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:13,319
decides you know like yep they're a

00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:15,390
poisonous person but she is a fantastic

00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:16,470
coder and developer we can't get rid of

00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:20,789
her

00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:24,779
but at least you will have a community

00:53:20,789 --> 00:53:26,880
support system built around you you know

00:53:24,779 --> 00:53:29,819
the developer as well as incoming people

00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,890
well to help alleviate that at some

00:53:29,819 --> 00:53:34,529
level much more so than you would be

00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:36,240
otherwise so it's a you know it's

00:53:34,529 --> 00:53:39,900
possibility that that could never go

00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:44,760
away but still the community aspects

00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:45,930
will help out quite a bit I think it's

00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:49,380
great questions by the way thank you

00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:51,480
everyone well as I said before these

00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:53,940
slides are going to be up on SlideShare

00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:56,099
so be sure to download them enjoy the

00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:58,170
rest of the conference I will be around

00:53:56,099 --> 00:54:01,260
thank you for your apt attention

00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:05,040
especially after lunch everyone who

00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:08,760
stayed awake thank you very much enjoy

00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,760
