Description: 
	Committed to The Apache Way - Sharan Foga, Apache Software Foundation

To be committed' is a strange phrase. In the past it was used to describe people who were sent to mental institutions or 'facilities'. Fast forward to today and words like committed and commitment are used throughout the Open Source world. Are we all a little crazy? - Perhaps!

In this presentation Sharan shares her thoughts and experiences about being a Committer, life at the ASF (facility) and how not being able to code is still OK.

so first of all thank you very much for

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,350
coming through my presentation called

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:09,750
because we're committed to Apache

00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:11,460
so before I start can I just do a quick

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,150
survey how many do you have any

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,250
committees in the audience yeah and do

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,710
we have any sort of non-coding sort of

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:23,269
contributors or does it matter if you're

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:27,420
a committer or not any non-coding people

00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:29,400
we've got one and a half okay let's add

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,769
my heart oh yes okay yes that's good

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:37,020
that's good okay so my presentation

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:41,690
today is going to be about and being

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:44,219
involved in open source and also about

00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:48,090
enjoying what you do in open source and

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:52,500
also recognizing that no open source

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:55,820
software is around code and coding and

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:59,039
that there are non-coding contributions

00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,230
involved and also maybe sort of looking

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,149
at you know what people can contribute

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:10,080
to open source because it seems a bit

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:12,510
crazy readable so let me talk about my

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,030
my agenda today so I've split it into

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,580
four sections so we've got an

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:21,119
introduction where I'll run through some

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,369
definitions I'm going to I've got a

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,619
section second section is a life at the

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:27,990
facility so sorry welcome to our

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,689
facility the facility here is the Apache

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:33,750
Software Foundation and then we're going

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:36,240
to talk about sort of Ward life we're

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,350
going to do a summary of run through all

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,360
the main points that we've talked

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,520
through and then I'll open it up for any

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,710
questions and any comments so that's

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,329
going to be the organization of the talk

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:50,070
today so let me start so I'm going to

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:51,000
start with some definitions because the

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,009
definitions are always good because

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,840
people they have a common understanding

00:01:53,009 --> 00:02:00,090
for people so a couple of definitions so

00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,350
commitment the use of legal means to

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,990
send a person to a mental hospital

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:08,810
insane asylum or psychiatric ward

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:11,879
so anybody fit in that category

00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,950
another definition according this to

00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:17,069
give your time and energy

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:19,459
something that you believe in your time

00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:24,629
and energy to something you believe in

00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:27,450
so you would give your time freely to

00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:28,940
create something that somebody else

00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,680
would you somebody that you don't know

00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:35,459
you can be working with people you don't

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,519
know and you'll do this for free and

00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:42,269
you'll do this quite happily now that

00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:44,959
sounds a bit strange doesn't it so maybe

00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:50,190
these two definitions are linked somehow

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:52,579
mm-hmm I don't know so let's take a look

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,730
at another couple of definitions a

00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:56,220
committer

00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,630
so this is a term that you hear a lot in

00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,970
open-source so I've taken a couple of

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,620
definitions one of the definitions I've

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,989
taken is from Wikipedia and the other

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,700
definition I've taken from the ASF site

00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:07,290
or I've shortened it because there's

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,849
some other things in there about having

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,680
an apache ID and all this sort of stuff

00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:13,200
so but anyway let's take a look at them

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,940
a committer is an individual who's able

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,540
to modify the source code of a

00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:20,850
particular piece of open-source software

00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:23,549
being able to modify the source code and

00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,350
that's the Wikipedia definition so the

00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:27,600
apache definition is a committee is a

00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:31,819
developer who was given write access to

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:36,540
the code repository so spot the link

00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:40,290
code commissars need to being to do

00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:42,389
something and modify code okay also

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,819
notice that it doesn't actually mention

00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:47,700
anything about commitment it just

00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:49,230
mentions the code so one of the things

00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:53,970
I'd like to sort of mention here is that

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:56,190
you know being a committer doesn't mean

00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:59,880
that it's a measure of your commitment

00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:02,790
and you don't have to be a commissioner

00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:07,200
to show any commitment you know it's

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:09,480
just you know there is no you don't have

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,160
to be Cammisa you can still be committed

00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,709
to do something you can give your time

00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,160
willingly to do something and be

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:16,160
committed

00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:23,460
so one of the things don't let me just

00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:25,350
move on so one of the things I touched

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:28,919
on is you know is it all about the code

00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:30,540
is it only about the code because all

00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:35,130
the people that are involved in Apache

00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:38,160
we willingly give our time we willingly

00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:39,330
give our energy to do something so you

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,139
know I do it you do it

00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:46,350
and we do it no we think it's fine we

00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:49,919
enjoy it so when we contribute to a

00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:54,210
project is it only about the code so

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:57,870
Apache all patchy projects are software

00:04:54,210 --> 00:05:00,930
related ones so you tend to find that

00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:03,690
there is a big focus on on the code

00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:07,380
because you know that's that's what it

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:09,419
is about it's about maybe coding so

00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,010
generating releases so if you need to

00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:14,070
general release release you need to do

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:16,710
all the work around generating that

00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:22,830
release so fixing bugs doing technical

00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:25,860
reviews creating releases coding so I

00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:28,440
would say I'm actually we mentioned that

00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:32,370
there was a whole few committed illness

00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:34,710
in this group so what do you think were

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:37,889
the main factors of you being made a

00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:39,539
committer in your project do you think

00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:46,550
it was to do with your coding

00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:46,550
contribution justin is saying though so

00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:53,970
localization okay there's something for

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:55,650
you but oh so I would say that as a ton

00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,260
of software on software oriented

00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:02,610
projects then you do you coding does

00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:06,479
does get quite a big is a big quite a

00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:10,440
big influence because it the focus is

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:12,690
around generating release but in say for

00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,840
example the corporate world where you

00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:19,380
have your generating software releases

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,990
you tend to have a team of people where

00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,740
you have developers you have testers you

00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:26,000
have business analysts you have

00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,910
I don't change management people

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,710
marketing people etc and because you're

00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:33,229
in a corporate situation you have

00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:35,810
somebody that will specify skills that

00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:37,940
are needed for a specific team so you

00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,830
have somebody that says ok we're

00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,199
generating something so we actually need

00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:44,150
some testers so make sure that when

00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:47,210
we're delivering this project we have

00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:50,780
some testers available so within we're

00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:54,349
doing within apache it's not that

00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:57,560
straightforward because the community is

00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:58,970
quite a naturally organised one in the

00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,060
sense that the people that are

00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:04,940
interested just just arrive and the

00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:06,800
people that just arrive may not be the

00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:10,729
full balance of what you're what you

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:14,479
need for your project so this is why

00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:17,539
it's interesting to see that you know we

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:25,729
might be missing some of the areas where

00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:28,130
we need to deliver a project so to

00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:30,830
answer the question is coding everything

00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:33,139
well know coding isn't everything and I

00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:37,490
sort of mentioned a few other things as

00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:40,430
well so non-coding contributions exist

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,169
and they are important and I think sort

00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,120
of listening to some of the other talks

00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:46,009
on the on the track today

00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,759
you know there's a lot of projects that

00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:51,830
are really looking for these non-coding

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,449
contributions so they are looking for

00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:56,719
people to help them with their user

00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:59,090
testing and looking for people to do

00:07:56,719 --> 00:08:01,219
some things on training to do some

00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:03,830
things on marketing on design on

00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:05,810
documentation and one of the areas that

00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,539
I see that's quite interesting as well

00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:11,120
it's around community management so and

00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:14,210
what I mean by community management is

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:18,469
around being a facilitator for the

00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:20,180
community so where you have groups of

00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:23,210
people working on things you may have a

00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:27,919
user group and also your development

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:29,719
groups but also keeping the community in

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,360
Northwinds keeping the community

00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:35,329
informed about what's going on letting

00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,949
them know what what they can do making

00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:38,419
sure that the information is out there

00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:40,310
for people to

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:45,139
things and they know what's happening so

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:47,420
there's a lot of tasks around noncoding

00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:51,050
that that are really really important

00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:55,070
and I think that sometimes within apache

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:58,940
we struggle to to get to fill these

00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:01,130
these missing skills so one of the

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,949
things i would say is that you know as a

00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:08,199
project you know your mailing list

00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:14,120
really is your doorway to the world and

00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:16,490
people are looking in apt your project

00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,639
by oh your mailing list so you know if

00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:21,920
you're if people do not say judge people

00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:25,339
look at how you treat people people look

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,139
at how welcoming you are and so looking

00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:30,829
at your mailing lists and the way you

00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:32,329
welcome contributions and also the way

00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:35,930
you interact with each other is very

00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:38,029
very important so your user list I would

00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:40,070
say is an interesting place to look and

00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:43,100
to focus on if you're looking to try and

00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:45,949
gather contributions from non coders

00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:49,899
because they will have a different

00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:55,190
perspective they probably just need some

00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:57,649
interest to be able to contribute so if

00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:00,050
your conversations on your lists are

00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:02,959
mainly development ones then there's

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:05,720
nothing that people can add if you are

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,269
have got some ideas or some requirements

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,910
about what you want to do then that

00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:13,760
actually opens a little gap or a little

00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:15,199
open the door for people to say our site

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,949
okay they're looking for this skill

00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:23,120
maybe I can help there you know so this

00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:26,120
sort of thing so I'm going to just talk

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:30,370
a little bit about my history and and

00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:33,110
refer also I my background is in

00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:35,949
generally sort of corporate projects so

00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:38,329
I've worked on sort of international

00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:40,730
project teams where we have this

00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:42,319
organization of specialist skills so you

00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,600
know the project sponsor comes along and

00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:47,750
we get a tester get a marketing person

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,069
we get a developer we get all the full

00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,310
range of skills so it's not a problem

00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:53,770
we make sure we have this

00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:56,920
and we also have quite a fixed direction

00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:58,960
in what we're doing so this was

00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:02,850
something that you know a structured way

00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:06,550
this is how I I'm used to working so I

00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:09,070
had never really had any experience in

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,690
open source before I saw as I knew I

00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,310
hadn't used any open source project

00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:17,100
wasn't really any sort of bothered about

00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:17,100
it didn't really understand it and

00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:24,040
somebody came up to me one day and said

00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:26,020
hey you do sort of yuppie stuff so

00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,840
enterprise resource planning software

00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:31,990
you do some yuppie stuff and I said yeah

00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:36,640
I do a little bit he said I okay we'll

00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:40,150
take a look at this and I said yeah okay

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,700
I'll have a look and that project that

00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:46,930
they told me to look at was Apache oft

00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:48,580
and I thought I went and had a look at

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:52,590
the online demo because you can do that

00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:55,060
on my site I logged in played around

00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:57,600
this is quite interesting this looks

00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,830
like the sort of software that I've been

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:04,360
implementing from from corporate Center

00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:09,089
hold on what is this doing here for free

00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:11,080
why are there people building software

00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:14,970
spending their time and energy on

00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:17,290
software and giving it away for free

00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:19,060
what's the catch there must be some

00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,430
catch maybe they were just trying to get

00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,740
people to download it and then later on

00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:26,170
they were going to charge for it but but

00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:29,160
no it just seemed to be too good to be

00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:31,780
true yeah why would people do this and

00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,240
this was something that was really quite

00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:36,970
baffled me because I didn't understand

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,589
the concept of I didn't understand the

00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,750
business model because it to me it just

00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:47,880
didn't seem to make sense it seemed a

00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:52,390
bit crazy so I was sort of still quite

00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:56,170
interested in finding out what what was

00:12:52,390 --> 00:13:01,720
happening why people were doing this so

00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:03,120
I decided to take a look at the ASF take

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:07,319
a look at the project

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:09,180
and I did that by looking at their

00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:14,100
mailing list the front-door acceptive

00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:16,170
thing so I didn't sign up to the mailing

00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,519
list but I was just monitoring the

00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,819
mailing lists and I monitored the

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,920
mailing lists for maybe about six months

00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:24,350
six to eight months because this was

00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,959
something totally new to me I've never

00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:33,709
seen a mailing list before or it was

00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:36,629
just a different concept and I sort of

00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:39,839
hold on what's happening here there are

00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:45,230
people that are really working together

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:48,769
doing stuff and it doesn't seem too bad

00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:51,449
maybe there's something I can do to help

00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:53,670
because I looked at the the software and

00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:56,220
I thought well actually it seems very

00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:57,540
developer oriented and I had a bit of a

00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,540
functional background market alright

00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:03,180
maybe I can help here and I was

00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:05,939
monitoring the list but I wasn't

00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,740
actually posting anything so one of the

00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:11,790
things that projects need to be aware of

00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:13,170
is that that okay then we know that

00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:15,509
their public lists but there's a lot of

00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:17,519
people that are on those lists that are

00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:19,920
just watching they're not interacting

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,959
yet they're deciding whether or not they

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,929
will take the first step into the

00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:27,809
project or whether they will take a step

00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:31,230
back and decide no I'm not interested

00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:34,290
anymore so the way that you interact on

00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:36,449
your public list when when something

00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:41,069
goes well when something doesn't go well

00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:43,079
these are being watched by a lot of

00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:46,529
people more than the people that are

00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:49,649
actually active on your list so you are

00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:52,860
effectively ambassadors to the world and

00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:56,939
I thought you know this mailing list

00:14:52,860 --> 00:15:00,720
thing it seemed to work I think I need

00:14:56,939 --> 00:15:02,129
to write a bit and all these people and

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,029
there were a lot of people on those

00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:07,139
lists and a lot of these people were

00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:10,529
non-native English speakers and they

00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:13,970
were all doing this in English what why

00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:17,160
are we doing that it's harder for them

00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:19,800
so after six months explained months I

00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,720
decided okay right I'll make my first

00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,000
post I had to built up enough confidence

00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:29,820
to make my first post so I made my first

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:32,790
post and I started from there but I made

00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:35,370
that first post but I didn't understand

00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:37,170
or know about the Apache way I didn't

00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,340
understand or know about community I

00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:41,040
didn't understand or know about

00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:43,710
consensus all I knew was there's a

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:47,480
mailing list I think I could help I will

00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,480
post some stuff and that's all I did

00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:55,800
so once I started posting to the list I

00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:58,350
was looking around to see whether or not

00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:02,160
you know how do we start doing stuff

00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:04,470
because you know it's food in charge

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,380
I see the terms your project management

00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:09,960
committee I thought wow this is these

00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,370
are the the project managers or these

00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,170
are the project sponsors that are

00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,540
pushing the project forward that's why

00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:18,810
it's working so much the committers

00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:20,250
these guys are all all the project

00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,560
managers are working with the

00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,090
contributors to do all this stuff but

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,220
when I was actually in there

00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:30,090
I started interacting with the community

00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:33,630
and posting well what's next

00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:35,010
now hold on who's the boss although that

00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,780
but there is no boss there is a

00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:39,630
corporate structure there is no

00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:44,100
hierarchy of a team like you have in the

00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:47,820
corporate sense everybody is empowered

00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:51,150
to have a say in what happens so there's

00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:54,540
no one in charge but then everybody is

00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:57,090
in charge and to me that seemed like why

00:16:54,540 --> 00:17:00,180
how can anything get done it's

00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:06,770
disorganized chaos nothing will get ever

00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:06,770
get ever get done right wrong

00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:16,750
one of the things that I found was that

00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:19,960
you know people didn't have a overall

00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:22,300
big project plan with time limits and

00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:26,170
descriptions of what deliverables they

00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:28,780
needed to do people seemed to look at

00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:31,390
the project to look at the tasks and say

00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:35,260
okay this is something that needs doing

00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:38,440
I'll do that this is something I like

00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:42,390
doing I will do that I've got an idea to

00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:48,280
do something I will do that it seemed to

00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:53,050
be something that was quite natural and

00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:55,210
organic and how can that work so it was

00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:58,210
empowering people to do what they enjoy

00:17:55,210 --> 00:18:01,660
to do what they thought would help and

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:05,470
to do what they thought needed doing so

00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:08,200
it was empowering the community and I

00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:10,720
thought well you know what could I do if

00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:14,520
I want to start using this model as an

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,520
encoder what could I do

00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:20,800
so what did I do

00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:23,230
I I thought well I I could see that

00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,210
they're missing some areas around the

00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,100
functional side because it was an accent

00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:29,710
of different applications and I will

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:32,200
help doing some functional testing just

00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:35,080
to look at the business flows I would

00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,810
look at some of the documentation and I

00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,790
would contribute that back I would look

00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:42,370
at the wiki I would do this I would do

00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:44,920
some testing I would report things that

00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:47,140
are not working etc so I thought well

00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,780
yeah I can do that I've chosen something

00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:53,080
and I started to get very very active on

00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:58,420
the list and I found that people that

00:18:53,080 --> 00:19:01,060
gave me access to various wiki's various

00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:04,390
consulates pacing is various people I

00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:07,270
didn't know we're trusting me to do

00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:10,390
things for the project people that I've

00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:12,250
never met people that I only know from

00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,660
from what they've liked for trusting me

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:17,110
why would they do that

00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:18,909
and I was working and being quite active

00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:21,309
and I didn't realize that

00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:23,769
you know just doing that was actually

00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:25,149
earning me merit I didn't understand the

00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:27,460
concept of merit didn't understand

00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:29,440
consensus a keyway merit didn't

00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:34,149
understand it was just in the project

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:37,570
and I realized that after a while that

00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:39,340
you know I was doing more and more I was

00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,440
getting on more and more with the

00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,299
community and they were quite welcoming

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,330
they were plus one Jones got an idea

00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:48,009
plus one yet yet this is good and I felt

00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:50,049
that I was quite independent in the

00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:52,869
sense that I could do what I wanted to

00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:54,879
do and enjoy it and this is concept of

00:19:52,869 --> 00:19:56,679
Marius and I think you've been brought

00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:59,559
up in quite a few of the presentations

00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:02,799
today is around doing something that

00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:05,080
community values and by showing that

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,820
you're valuing noncoding contributions

00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:10,899
there's a real strong message the rest

00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:14,049
of community so it's not only just code

00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:16,419
I think it's easier to measure the code

00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:18,580
because this patches this lines of code

00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:20,830
you can look at the source code and see

00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:24,249
who's contributed of things but other

00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:28,570
things that are non-coding documentation

00:20:24,249 --> 00:20:33,070
like marketing like testing etc they're

00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:36,399
not so quantifiable so that could be an

00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:42,789
issue so that the key thing is that it's

00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:48,460
not just for code so who have invisible

00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:52,590
friends well I would say everybody has

00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:55,749
invisible friends anybody that is on the

00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:59,200
mailing list that is dealing with

00:20:55,749 --> 00:21:01,210
somebody that you'll never ever met you

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,859
you sign on to a mailing list how do you

00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,509
know that you're talking to such a

00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:07,960
search have you seen them have you met

00:21:04,509 --> 00:21:10,509
them do you know know you're trusting

00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:14,440
but this person that you're talking to

00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:18,789
is someone and you know this person only

00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:24,220
by what they write you know them by what

00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:26,499
they write so it's a huge empowering

00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,450
thing in the sense that you've you're

00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:29,580
working with someone that has the same

00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:32,130
goal that's

00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:34,380
around the project building a software

00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:35,700
that's going to be used by the community

00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,910
and via the people that we're going to

00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,800
give away and you're doing with people

00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:43,350
you don't even know and they don't

00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:47,940
really know you but they trust you that

00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:51,120
is so empowering and you find that you

00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:53,400
learn about people are you you form an

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,270
ideas about people by the way they write

00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,040
and what they write so you build your

00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:00,750
personality or a personality for them in

00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:05,160
your mind so you do have invisible

00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:07,170
friends um I was involved with the

00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:11,610
Apache off days I think I started in

00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:14,760
2008 I was I started my first post and I

00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:18,600
didn't actually meet anybody in person

00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:20,250
from the community until 2014 at one of

00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,980
these Apache comes which is why Patrick

00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:25,740
on is really quite quite important and

00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:28,890
it was really amazing really because you

00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,660
saw the name and he thought that's such

00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,100
a search it's like meeting our friends

00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:35,130
it was like meeting an old family per

00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,750
euro and even here this week I have seen

00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:38,370
the names of people that I have seen on

00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,380
the mailing list and I've never ever met

00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:42,360
them and then Isis I've seen them and

00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:45,090
greeted them like an old friend and I

00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,250
think that is part of the evacuate

00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:49,770
that's part of this community building

00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:51,810
that you realize is happening when you

00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:54,570
are on the mailing list and you're

00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:57,210
building a social network the mailing

00:22:54,570 --> 00:23:00,270
list isn't only about you know talking

00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:02,070
about code and talking about what you're

00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:04,860
going to program and what you're going

00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:06,890
to review it's actually about social

00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:09,300
interaction is actually about

00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:11,640
collaboration and this is the thing that

00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,440
builds the trust this is the thing

00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:20,550
working together towards a common goal

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:22,940
it is absolutely amazing so the common

00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:26,730
room so I call this a common room so I

00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:30,090
mentioned before about the structure of

00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:34,050
the community and in the sense that we

00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:37,980
had in a corporate sense you have a

00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:40,830
hierarchy so you have your senior

00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,210
project sponsor senior management you

00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,809
have your project team you have your

00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,759
project manner

00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:46,769
you have the people in the team and they

00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:48,960
have their deliverables that they set

00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:52,139
out to deliver they have the project

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,120
they have a timeline they have processes

00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:56,190
they have them the rules that they're

00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,909
going to do and everything is very clear

00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:01,289
everything is quite laid out before and

00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:02,759
because you have that structure that

00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:04,259
organized structure there and you have

00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:08,340
all the skills you need it's not a

00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:11,090
problem so in a community where people

00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:15,179
are free to come and go as they please

00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:18,869
you find that in software development

00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:20,929
you tend to have an excuse sort of

00:24:18,869 --> 00:24:22,830
distribution of developers because

00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:25,409
developers are the first people that

00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:28,379
tend to come into a project they're the

00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:31,169
ones that are building the product they

00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:32,970
are the ones that are happy ideas about

00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:34,940
how they can do things they are the ones

00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:37,320
that are creating releases and and

00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:40,970
making sure that the users can actually

00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:45,419
download and use this this product but

00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:49,830
from a usability side the users may have

00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:51,570
some ideas some input some some details

00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:56,129
that you know hey we've used your

00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:58,559
software and it would be nice if or are

00:24:56,129 --> 00:25:00,899
we didn't like the look of that or our

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,789
that process doesn't work too well

00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:05,999
because one of the things that I found

00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:09,929
being involved with Apache arthas was

00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:12,929
that although the screens looked had all

00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:14,700
the fields you know they're for flows

00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:17,039
and whatever but from a usability

00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,019
perspective I thought well actually it

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,789
might be nicer if it slowed this way

00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:22,320
because this seemed to be more of a

00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:25,799
business flow how a business person

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,990
would use it or this would be more

00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:29,759
interesting this this use case would be

00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:31,529
more interesting this way because that's

00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,480
the standard way that people do this

00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:35,490
sort of thing and that's the sort of

00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:39,659
input that we could be quite interesting

00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:42,629
for a project because you have some

00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:44,129
ideas about how the people think it

00:25:42,629 --> 00:25:45,929
should work and then you have the

00:25:44,129 --> 00:25:48,330
information about how the users actually

00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:50,580
use it and to bring those together is

00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:53,639
where is where you can add some value

00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:56,519
and for a patchy project that's where

00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:59,879
you can also bring in the people that

00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:02,489
maybe not so developer oriented but more

00:25:59,879 --> 00:26:06,809
under usability side and more on the the

00:26:02,489 --> 00:26:10,979
the areas where you you are not you're

00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:15,239
not not so strong so when I when I

00:26:10,979 --> 00:26:17,009
started looking at community and the

00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:19,799
chaos and I thought it was in formal

00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:23,789
chaos but it was it was fine and I found

00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:26,820
I had to adapt to be working in a

00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:29,729
different way and one of the things that

00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:31,049
I realized one things I expected

00:26:29,729 --> 00:26:32,549
actually was that there was this

00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:37,969
hierarchy the same corporate hierarchy

00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:42,899
in Apache but there wasn't and this this

00:26:37,969 --> 00:26:46,859
the titles of committer and PMC member

00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:49,349
and a SF member was not like a promotion

00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:53,219
structure as you have in corporate it

00:26:49,349 --> 00:26:56,700
was just a recognition of merit and so

00:26:53,219 --> 00:26:58,979
the key thing that I found I realized

00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,769
was it wasn't a hierarchy it's a

00:26:58,979 --> 00:27:04,349
community on the mailing list everybody

00:27:01,769 --> 00:27:06,749
is a contributor everybody is a

00:27:04,349 --> 00:27:08,339
contributor it's not that I'm a

00:27:06,749 --> 00:27:10,559
committer and I'm telling you was a

00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:12,979
contributor you can't do that or I am a

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,809
PMC member and I'm telling you as a

00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:17,999
committer you you must do this it's not

00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:21,769
that it's not that everybody is a

00:27:17,999 --> 00:27:23,669
contributor everybody is I had has a

00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:26,459
responsibility for the welfare of the

00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:30,200
community everybody has a common goal

00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:30,200
and that was the key

00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:38,800
and this this section is called escape

00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:42,650
attempts so um when you look at

00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:45,410
open-source communities people leave its

00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:48,920
there are various reasons but people

00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:50,960
leave and there are the first reason I

00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,300
will talk about is the natural cycle

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,570
because sometimes people people will

00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:58,760
come on to a project and they naturally

00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:00,470
leave for example I think they have you

00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,960
know students command during google

00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:05,330
Summer of Code or people join a project

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,390
to implement some sort of functionality

00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:10,850
or that an employer that's contributing

00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:12,950
to an open-source project and they

00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:15,140
change job and they no longer contribute

00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:18,110
so they leave so that's a very natural

00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:20,660
cycle other reasons that people leave is

00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:23,690
that it's not a good fit for them so

00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:26,030
maybe they are used to doing something

00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:28,310
in a particular way and they don't

00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:29,870
really want to injure adjust or if they

00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:32,990
do try and adjust it cause of some

00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:36,830
frustration I know that when I started

00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:39,680
with Apache the mailing list was a real

00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:43,070
big adjustment for me because I had not

00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:45,860
had that that sort of interaction before

00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:47,750
and so but I chose to adjust I said

00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:50,590
right okay I think this is worth doing

00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:53,060
and I will do it so I just did two

00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:54,740
bailing lists so this is this is if it's

00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:58,130
not a good fit for some people some

00:28:54,740 --> 00:29:00,650
people will want to leave another reason

00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:02,870
why people may want to leave the source

00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:05,480
or Apache community is around conflicts

00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:08,480
where they don't get on or they have

00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:10,580
disagreements etc and I think when you

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,070
have a group of diverse people together

00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:15,620
you are guaranteed a hundred percent

00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:17,360
guaranteed to get disagreement there's

00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,340
no way around you'll know that everybody

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:23,810
is not going to agree on everything

00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:25,400
so you but the way the thing about it is

00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:29,360
that the way that you manage the

00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:32,150
disagreement or decide whether or not it

00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:36,620
becomes a battle on opening open warfare

00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:41,430
or a battle and if it becomes personal

00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:47,130
where people are afraid to

00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:49,080
to to step down from a point that

00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:51,630
they've made because they think it would

00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:54,540
reflect on their status if they think it

00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:58,110
would reflect on them personally very

00:29:54,540 --> 00:30:01,110
very badly and this is something that is

00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:03,390
really really we need to be really

00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:06,180
really careful about because if people

00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:10,950
are doing something that they have put a

00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:12,900
lot of emotion into then they are they

00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:14,970
can get defensive about something

00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:17,790
because they own it they feel like it's

00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:21,180
you know this is my thing this is my

00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:23,460
thing but I've created and you don't

00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:26,910
understand it and I know that it's right

00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:28,530
and so it's it becomes an emotional

00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:30,540
thing so we just need to be careful

00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:33,480
about this the the main thing to

00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:36,410
remember is that we want the community

00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,760
to endure this is the key thing about

00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:41,010
Apache and communities we want the

00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:44,910
community to endure into the future and

00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:46,950
I know that you know it I won't I may

00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:49,890
not be around in 9 or 10 years 20 years

00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:51,390
whatever but I would like my project or

00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:53,990
the projects that I'm involved in to be

00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:57,450
around so therefore I need to work today

00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:59,610
to help to bring people into the project

00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:01,770
that will be there in 10 or 20 or

00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:05,070
whatever years or they will bring people

00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:07,050
in to be there in 10 or 20 years so it's

00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:10,430
we want the project to exist into the

00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:13,530
future so we need to make sure that we

00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:18,960
continually look for some caretakers

00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:21,210
maintainer of a software so we can talk

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,480
it quickly about some treatment plan so

00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:26,790
the two cases that I've highlighted here

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,150
are around conflict so I mentioned

00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:32,490
conflict in the previous slide so one of

00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:34,830
the things about conflict is that it's

00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:38,100
something that can escalate quite

00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:41,400
quickly and it can become quite negative

00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:44,370
sometimes if we don't resolve it and it

00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:46,350
for me it's always been about trying to

00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:49,230
take the emotion out of it and trying to

00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:52,020
make sure that you understand the

00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:53,330
reasons for the conflict if it's an idea

00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:56,270
about particular

00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:59,960
is it idea about a strategy is it an

00:31:56,270 --> 00:32:02,210
idea about being able to promote the

00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,900
project what is the reasoning behind the

00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:08,390
conflict and we find that that sometimes

00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:11,240
the conflict has become a conflict

00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:15,170
because it becomes personal life if we

00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:17,870
look at the project as a an entity and

00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:20,660
say right okay we're concerned with the

00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:22,970
welfare of the project we want the

00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:26,750
project so we want to do the best our

00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:28,610
very best for the project what can we do

00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:31,310
that is the very best for the project

00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:33,290
and the question is you know are you

00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:35,510
doing what you're doing for you

00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:37,850
or are you doing what you're doing for

00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:41,900
the project for the best of the project

00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:45,650
and this is where I think you can find

00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:47,720
some answers to conflict in the sense

00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:50,060
that people may need to sort of step

00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,040
back and say well actually maybe I was

00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:54,080
doing that because it was I was too

00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,550
close to it it was my personal idea and

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,030
I feel that I need to defend something

00:32:55,550 --> 00:33:00,770
and maybe it maybe it wasn't in the

00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:03,050
right the best interests of the project

00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:06,700
and if you start from that common ground

00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:08,810
I think this is a Lisa stepping stone to

00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:13,070
resolving it so we're all in it together

00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:15,020
and the second top area that I wanted to

00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:18,140
highlight is - where to find new

00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:20,300
companions so how do you recruit people

00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:24,440
until you into your into your project

00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:29,030
and I find for our project it's the user

00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:33,230
list it's the user list I know that we

00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:36,500
we have a lot of service companies etc

00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:38,540
that monitor our dev list but we have a

00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,340
lot of people a lot of users that are

00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:43,160
sitting on our debt on our user list

00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:46,400
that maybe don't post or post very

00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:48,590
rarely and so trying to involve them

00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,630
trying to communicate with them trying

00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:53,300
to show them where the prod with the

00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:55,250
project is wanting to go and what we

00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:57,950
think is important this isn't where we

00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:59,810
can try and get some some feedback from

00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:01,730
people and make sure that they're

00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:05,150
they're encouraged to participate so

00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:06,860
sometimes we find that people are saying

00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:08,990
hey I'd like to do something

00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:10,879
and people are encouraged to do proof of

00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:12,950
proof of concepts you know go away and

00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,840
go and do something and come back and

00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:16,580
we'll have a look at it and then people

00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:20,179
get that pause that first positive

00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:22,970
reaction and they're motivated to go and

00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:25,070
there you know in energize to sort of do

00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:26,690
something and they go away and go and do

00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:28,550
something and they come back they come

00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,780
back really really quickly yes we've

00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:32,960
done this here it is

00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:34,940
ah right okay have you thought about

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,399
doing this we could that looks good that

00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:39,740
looks good maybe we can and then all of

00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:43,399
a sudden you find that you're pulling in

00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:45,080
various people from the community I was

00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:46,429
I do some stuff on that I do some stuff

00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,500
on that maybe something something

00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:51,109
together and straight away you've got a

00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:53,480
bit of a synergy and that really really

00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:59,540
hurt that really really helped so this

00:34:53,480 --> 00:35:01,070
is a treatment plan so I'm gonna so I so

00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:03,260
if we take a look at the symptom so I

00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:05,540
just want you to see where you but I

00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,770
mean we've got got a few people in here

00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,570
that our committees already said but I

00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:11,840
think it'd be interesting questions as

00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:14,900
well so if you're you know where are you

00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:16,760
are you already involved in open source

00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,100
so are you still looking at it from the

00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,650
outside are you still not sure whether

00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:24,320
or not you want to get involved with an

00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:26,390
Apache project maybe you're a user at

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,609
the moment and you're here at Apache Con

00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:31,190
to find out a bit more about Apache and

00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:33,290
how it all works you know are you

00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:36,160
monitoring any existing lists at the

00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:39,380
moment are you watching it at community

00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,810
yeah you know are you already inside a

00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:44,480
community are you already contributor in

00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:45,859
a community but you're not sure what you

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,070
want to work on you're not sure what to

00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:51,080
do next or maybe you found something

00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:52,400
that you want to work on but you're you

00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:55,010
you're not sure about how to post

00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:59,420
straight post of the listen they are

00:35:55,010 --> 00:36:02,030
maybe they won't what what I want ya

00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:03,980
happy you know have you started doing

00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:05,240
things that you already enjoy and you

00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:08,990
think that we've really really

00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:11,090
beneficial for the project or maybe you

00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:13,640
know you're frustrated in the project

00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:15,440
and you're you're finding you're

00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:18,280
conflicted and you're not sure whether

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,280
or not you want to stay

00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:25,360
have you worked with the community are

00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:28,210
you realizing that you know you have the

00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:32,160
responsibility a part of a community to

00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:35,560
look after the welfare of that project

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:41,800
so where you think about where you are

00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:44,500
in your open-source journey so I will do

00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:47,440
my summary diagnosis so just a bit of a

00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:49,570
review so commitment okay we're not

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,840
committed to a mental institution yet

00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:55,560
but we are giving our time and energy

00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:58,750
doing something that we believe in

00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:03,700
that's what we're doing every day we're

00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:06,120
doing good we're helping our projects by

00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:09,340
doing things that the community values

00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:11,560
this is merit this is where you gain

00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:18,000
merit doing something the community

00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:21,520
values we also have a responsibility for

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,010
looking after our community from making

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,500
sure that our community will endure for

00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:28,780
looking after the code for looking after

00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:31,960
the community and the project but not

00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:36,430
only the code we also have a

00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:39,670
responsibility to our users and our

00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:43,200
developers to to bring them together to

00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:46,270
create a vibrant and diverse community

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:49,030
so I would say you know if you have all

00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:55,200
of these then you're definitely

00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:55,200
committed thank you for your listening

00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:02,350
so I don't know so do do I have any

00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,880
questions does anybody have any

00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:07,290
questions or comments even or

00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,290
alternative diagnosis

00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:21,010
no worries okay thank you very much

00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,010
