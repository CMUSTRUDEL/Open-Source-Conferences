	A Tour of the New Apache OpenWhisk Incubator Project and Its Numerous Repositories - Matt Rutkowski, IBM Open Technologies

The OpenWhisk project was accepted as an Incubator project in late November last year. You may know it as a Serverless or Function-as-a-Service platform, but did you know the project itself is comprised of, as of today's count, 30 repositories and growing. These repos. comprise what I call the OpenWhisk ecosystem; it includes not only a built-in Catalog of system actions, but also numerous Command Line Interface (CLI) bindings, Packages (of Actions, Triggers and Feeds), Orchestration tooling for manifest-based deplyments, Developer Tooling, SDKs, Docker language and blackbox Runtimes and most importantly a complete API Gateway that enables its own pluggable framework for securely connect and routing to the platform. This session aims to take you on a tour of what is there (with occasional semi-deep dives) to use, integrate with and hopefully contribute to as we grow our new community.

About Matt Rutkowski
My amorphous job and tile within IBM encompass engaging with and progressing all manner of open source and stds. projects, basically anything that is “born on,” connects to, or touches cloud (e.g., data, services, fabric, distributed platforms, IoT, etc.). Currently, I am leading ecosystem development for the Apache OpenWhisk project which is being used by IBM Cloud Functions (Serverless) platform while still working in the OASIS TOSCA std., and previously various OpenStack projects.
