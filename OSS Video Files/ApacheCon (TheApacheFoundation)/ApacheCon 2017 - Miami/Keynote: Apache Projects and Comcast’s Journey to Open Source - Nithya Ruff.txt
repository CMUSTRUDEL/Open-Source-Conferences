	Keynote: Apache Projects and Comcast’s Journey to Open Source - Nithya Ruff, Sr. Director, Open Source Practice, Comcast

Over the past 10 years, Comcast has become a strong technology and software company creating original work to deliver innovative experiences to customers.  Increasingly, open source fuels Comcast’s software stacks, development methodology and support for community.  My talk is about our journey to open source and how Apache projects are at the heart of many of our technology innovations.

okay so it's really going to be a love

00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:10,769
letter to be Apache foundation so as

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:13,259
rich was explaining my name is mithya

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,719
ruff and I've been working in open

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,359
source it feels like forever but when I

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,580
really calculated it it's almost the

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,010
same time as the Apache foundation was

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:26,220
founded was when I started working in

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,130
open-source so let me start with telling

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,850
you my open-source journey it was back

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:35,760
in 1998 Wow

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:39,510
I've been in this industry so long it

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,180
was at SGI and SGI was moving from

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:45,239
proprietary hardware and software to a

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:50,160
more standards-based open-source and

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:52,949
Microsoft NT on Intel servers and I was

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,870
part of the team that was working on the

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,989
open-source strategy so how do we work

00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:00,000
with the community and what touches do

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:03,000
we give back you know how do we bring

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,739
parity between ir x and linux and and so

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,500
on and so forth and how do we make money

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,780
and you know simple things like that so

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,700
this was a fantastic experience for me

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,619
because it really gave me a taste of

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,369
open-source during the early days

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:19,950
remember the IBM love piece and

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,479
open-source campaign we were all trying

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,180
to figure out how to work with

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,060
open-source as companies and since then

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,970
my journey has been that I've had a

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,259
chance to build bridges between

00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,390
companies and communities and

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,390
communities and companies and that's

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,939
been the role that I've been playing at

00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:40,380
tripwire which is a security company

00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:43,500
where the open source supplier for

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,540
example and then at vin river systems

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,149
which is a subsidiary of intel's

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:51,329
had a chance to work on the Oslo project

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:53,280
and take it to market and then move to

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:55,560
Western Digital where I had a chance to

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,869
start the Western Digital open source

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,090
office and frankly with more and more

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,939
companies going to open source companies

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,280
are starting open source program offices

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,300
very similar to what Jim does what I do

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,760
and the other

00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,890
half of my personality and my passions

00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,490
has been around diversity and inclusion

00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:17,170
in open-source so you'll see me

00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:19,450
advocating and being an ally and a

00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,360
champion for diversity in such

00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:24,880
organizations as a woman of OpenStack or

00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,910
as the Linux foundations women in

00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,160
open-source and I have the good fortune

00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:32,470
of also sitting on the board of the

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,340
Linux Foundation and core chicks who

00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:38,440
really attract retain and develop new

00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,870
developers new contributors to open

00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,690
source in general so that brings me to

00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:46,510
my Comcast role I just joined Comcast in

00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:49,230
January of this year and you know one of

00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:52,210
the questions I often get asked is

00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,670
Comcast and open source what are you

00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:57,370
doing at Comcast I didn't know I'm

00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,650
casting and open source office and do

00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:02,230
they actually create software do their

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:05,400
work in software and and my most

00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:10,420
favorite question is do I get free cable

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:13,959
and do I get free Internet and guess

00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:16,690
what I do and I love it and I can also

00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:19,390
help you solve your cable issues I can

00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:22,230
you know call the magic number and help

00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:25,209
you with your cable so let me talk about

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:28,239
Comcast's transformation into a software

00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:31,870
organization I think it was around the

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,239
year 2000 when like many companies we

00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,970
were consuming off-the-shelf proprietary

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,010
hardware software we were totally

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,890
dependent upon external third-party

00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,750
vendors we were dependent upon them to

00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,330
support IVA dependent upon them for

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,520
innovation we would often provide

00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:51,489
detailed requirements to these vendors

00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:54,760
and we'd wait with you know waiting on

00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:58,330
them to deliver on the requirements and

00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,910
then it was around 2006 2007 we realized

00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:03,220
that we could actually take these

00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,910
requirements and start working on it

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,370
ourselves

00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:10,030
and this was also about the same time

00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:12,760
that open source was more mature was

00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,010
really innovating in many of the areas

00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,220
that we cared about and this was an

00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:20,709
opportunity for us to take code and it

00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,340
really empowered us to start

00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:26,020
using the code to create our own

00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,240
solution to build our own infrastructure

00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:31,539
to deliver innovation and services to

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:35,050
our customers and then between 2006 and

00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:37,330
2007 a lot of the developers in the

00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,789
company would say I want to give this

00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:42,099
code back if I make changes I want to

00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:45,580
put it back because it's the right thing

00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:47,860
to do it also helps me not carry

00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,340
technical debt it's good for the company

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,990
and it's good for the community and

00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,630
frankly we are doing some really smart

00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:58,300
things at scale that others probably can

00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:00,490
benefit from and so you found that a

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:04,180
number of people wanted to give back and

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:06,330
the company then was smart enough to set

00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,910
up an open-source Advisory Council and

00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:11,289
start approving these contributions

00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:14,409
changing the way we do business inside

00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:17,229
the company and making that possible so

00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:20,770
today when I entered the company I came

00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:22,900
into this magical place truly it is a

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:25,690
magical place inside the company where

00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,659
people are really committed to working

00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:30,849
in open-source using open-source

00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:32,979
developing contributing back it's one of

00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:34,900
the largest github installations I've

00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:38,349
seen it's one of the largest slash

00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:41,190
channels I've seen and and frankly my

00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:43,449
job is easy because I get to enable that

00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,849
transformation I get to support that

00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:49,560
transformation as an open-source program

00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:52,469
office so let me give you an example of

00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:58,300
one of the transformations that happened

00:05:52,469 --> 00:06:00,580
how many of you use x1 in your home ok

00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:04,539
it's a different experience altogether

00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:08,080
isn't it I love my x1 all I have to say

00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:11,050
is Game of Thrones and it finds me my

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:14,380
Game of Thrones episode decide I don't

00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:17,380
have to go getting to Netflix and then

00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:20,770
finding my are HBO and finding my

00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,050
episode etc so it's very very easy so

00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:26,110
the x1 operating system was created

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:29,469
about the year 2012 and then as you can

00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:31,630
see we started kind of taking a destiny

00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:33,660
into our own hands to transform the way

00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:36,390
people watch TV

00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:39,060
from there we went to streaming because

00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:42,720
more and more of us are seeming media on

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:45,240
our phones on our laptops etc right

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,750
before I travel to Miami and download in

00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,580
a number of episodes of the tooter

00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:54,390
episode on Showtime so that I could

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:57,270
watch it on United and and frankly then

00:06:54,390 --> 00:07:01,190
we went to broadband and behind all this

00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:04,220
is really a very very dynamic

00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:08,040
multi-platform multi-tenant cloud-based

00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:11,070
application platform with a really

00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,320
strong IP broad base a broadcast grade

00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:17,130
video delivery platform boy that's a

00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:21,000
mouthful of words there to say so as you

00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:25,380
can imagine when you have to be

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,600
innovative and customer value is an

00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:30,150
important thing that we want to deliver

00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,330
when you charge customers money you want

00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:35,760
to deliver them outstanding value where

00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,220
people say yeah I think I'm getting

00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,870
value for my money and that's one of the

00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:43,950
things that we focus on and in doing so

00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:46,590
there are three goals that the

00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:49,590
technology and products group has which

00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:51,840
is building a rate of product build them

00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:55,380
in a reliable fashion and build them

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,620
securely and in so doing as you can see

00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:00,870
we have to use and touch practically

00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,870
every innovative technology you can

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:06,000
think of some of the things that my form

00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:09,330
the previous two speakers talked about

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,990
we'd ably use cloud both public private

00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:15,870
and hybrid we use iot on the device side

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:18,390
and the set-top box side we use big data

00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,100
to analyze our streams we use machine

00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:22,200
learning so that we can deliver better

00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:25,830
service to our customers and then behind

00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:29,700
all this is a gigantic network that

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:32,669
deliver service to customers and one of

00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:36,110
the things we found was that you know

00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:38,190
all of these fancy technologies are

00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:41,669
exactly what the Apache foundation

00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:43,890
focuses on and when we started counting

00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:45,190
all of the Apache projects that we

00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,740
relied on is a come

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,540
by the way this I don't think this is

00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,430
complete because there are lots and lots

00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,570
of other projects that guys haven't even

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:56,410
told me about

00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:59,050
but between we were using practically

00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:04,300
every Apache project that there was out

00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:07,120
there and it made us realize that we

00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:11,200
needed to increase our support our love

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,990
our you know sponsorship of Apache and

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,330
so this year we increase our sponsorship

00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:24,820
to the Platinum level and we are very

00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:28,480
very proud and frankly this is thanks to

00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:31,630
champions inside the company yep

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,250
Young Mandarin is here you know Phil

00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:36,400
Sauber who is an Apache foundation

00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:40,360
member it's also people like bass

00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:42,850
Livingston's Livengood rather and also

00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:46,510
Matthew Bailey and others who have

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:49,450
tirelessly convinced all of us that we

00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:52,300
must support Apache in a stronger way

00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:55,240
because we depend upon Apache so much we

00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,680
you know get so much good out of the

00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,340
foundation and working with the

00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:03,070
foundation so we do collaborate with

00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:05,710
other foundations as well and I love the

00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:09,550
foundation model because it allows us to

00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:13,780
work in key technology areas with other

00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:17,230
companies in a very neutral way and and

00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:20,770
clearly the Apache foundation is central

00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:25,870
to our strategy and to our working in

00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:28,630
open-source why do I love Apache I think

00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:30,970
it's like this big fish when you have

00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:34,030
lots of little fishes all swimming

00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:36,790
together in unison and working

00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:40,840
harmoniously together you become this

00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:43,720
gigantic force that overcomes all of the

00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,730
other small fishes out there and I

00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,060
particularly liked and I sat in the

00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:51,520
track today for the Apache way

00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:53,920
communications and I was so inspired by

00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,680
the fact that the foundation spent so

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,850
much time and energy investing in

00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,639
creating a

00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:03,310
and culture across all of the Apache

00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,529
project whether it is paying attention

00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:07,630
to community because good community

00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:11,230
healthy communities create healthy code

00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:13,959
or valuing all contributions equally

00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:17,319
whether you're a documentation person or

00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:19,660
an evangelist or a code contributor that

00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:23,019
you are valuable to creating this

00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:26,800
community of course world-class projects

00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:28,959
and respect for diversity and and last

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,060
but not the least this this was always

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,790
kind of puzzling to me that on the one

00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:35,980
hand the Apache foundation was so

00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:38,139
innovative and creative in its cultural

00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:41,230
thinking and on the other hand it was

00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:43,690
also equally pragmatic so you had both

00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:46,389
pragmatic as well as creative in the

00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:49,600
same organization and we love the Apache

00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:51,759
2.0 license by the way it favors and

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,910
supports for companies as well as

00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:58,540
community and we really like that so I

00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,889
said it was a love letter so here's one

00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,680
of the projects that I wanted to

00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:05,500
highlight the Apache traffic control is

00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:08,589
something Comcast is very very proud to

00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:11,560
support it's used in our production

00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:14,139
facilities it is an incubation project

00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,990
with the Apache foundation and it really

00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:19,839
helped us recruit a lot of you know

00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:22,060
really good developers as you saw from

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,579
the beginning you know most people don't

00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:27,339
know us as open-source friendly a

00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:29,259
software company and so when we started

00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:31,990
getting involved in the traffic control

00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:34,630
project it really put us on the map as

00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:38,050
an open-source company and we appreciate

00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:40,209
that and it's allowed us to also attract

00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:43,810
other companies who want to use it and

00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:45,790
grow non Comcast submitters because we

00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:48,880
do want to have a very diverse and

00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:52,149
vibrant community with this project so

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,279
please I'm asking you get involved we

00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:56,500
are welcoming new contributors we'd love

00:12:54,279 --> 00:13:00,009
to have you take a look at the project

00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:02,860
get involved in this Yan tells me it was

00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:06,670
actually in 2012 when he started looking

00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:10,120
at this project they were mainly very

00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:12,060
proprietary CDN control plane projects

00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,740
and they weren't working with each other

00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,930
and it would force you into a vendor

00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:19,839
lock-in so that's when he started

00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:22,480
working on the project and he said I

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:26,460
purposely chose the Apache foundations

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:29,770
because I wanted a sustainable long-term

00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:31,870
community friendly healthy project and

00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:37,060
and this is where you build healthy

00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:39,520
projects so big shout out to a couple of

00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:42,310
people the gentleman in this picture I

00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:45,670
think many of you may know Phil's server

00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:48,310
Phil is an Apache foundation member and

00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:51,100
he is constantly telling us inside the

00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:53,650
company on how to follow the apache way

00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:56,500
it's so important to have a champion I

00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:59,380
think inside a company who really worked

00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:02,290
hard to communicate what the foundation

00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:04,210
does what the foundation way is that we

00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,740
can both transform ourselves inside the

00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:08,770
company as well as work with the

00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:11,560
foundation and jung-hwan Dorn is sitting

00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:15,760
somewhere at the back I thought Yann

00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:17,709
there years he's really a visionary he's

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,890
the one who created the traffic control

00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:24,910
project and other notable mentions here

00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:28,029
Jeff Derek mark Steve and Hank not all

00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:32,020
work at Comcast so we want to encourage

00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:34,060
more people to work with us there are

00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,890
other projects that we contribute to and

00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,620
also regional projects that we've put

00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:39,520
out on github.com slash Comcast please

00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,640
check it out

00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:45,430
there are about 85 repos more than

00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:49,750
10,000 commits clearly not as much as

00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:52,360
IBM or Intel or Samsung or others but I

00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:54,790
want to show you that you're not what

00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,070
you think we are we are a serious

00:14:54,790 --> 00:15:01,390
software company and we believe in open

00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:03,370
source and in what we can bring is both

00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:07,510
a user as well as a contributor to a

00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:11,350
project is that we work at scale we are

00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:14,620
constantly innovating we also do things

00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:16,510
in production and so you can be bring

00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,720
that level of testing and that gravitas

00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:21,459
to the table and also running it on

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,829
networks which serve millions of

00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:26,420
customer

00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:29,000
so when we started the open source

00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:31,009
practice at Comcast you say gosh you

00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,130
know they are already doing open source

00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:37,160
so why do they need to open an open

00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:40,250
source practice I see my role as the six

00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:43,220
C's that you see in the diagram and my

00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:45,589
job is really twofold one make it easy

00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:48,529
for this fantastic group of developers

00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:51,170
to do their work remove the obstacles in

00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:54,649
their way whether it's legal process or

00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:56,630
otherwise and second be visible in open

00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:58,250
source communities and be a part of

00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:00,470
those communities that we care about

00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:04,670
those are the two things that care about

00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:08,180
and let me also talk about another thing

00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:10,430
that I care about its diversity and

00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:13,519
inclusion in open source diversity of

00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:15,410
all kinds diversity of global thoughts

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:20,149
diversity of gender diversity of

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:22,699
abilities and thought and style etc it's

00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:24,470
very simple and we've all said this is a

00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:27,230
lot of digitization of companies

00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:30,920
happening software is eating the world

00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:32,959
an open source is the way most of this

00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,779
software is being created and used and

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:38,509
so I think we already have a challenge

00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:41,750
and we will continue to have a bigger

00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:44,060
talent shortage at Comcast but also in

00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,670
open source projects in general and we

00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:50,959
need to learn how to attract retain and

00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:53,389
develop talent of all sorts and frankly

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,069
inclusion often results in innovations

00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:57,470
because you have very different

00:16:55,069 --> 00:17:00,500
approaches coming together taking a look

00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:03,079
at the same problem and as the Apache

00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:06,079
Foundation has showed me today inclusion

00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:07,370
does not happen by accident it does not

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,429
happen organically

00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:13,370
it needs intention it needs leadership

00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:16,179
attention it needs people to be explicit

00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:20,689
about this as a goal and make it happen

00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:22,610
and it smashes bias in systems talk

00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:25,370
about machine learning and biases that

00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:27,799
can creep in if you have just one way of

00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:30,590
thinking that feeds that machine

00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:33,049
learning or feed that algorithm or feed

00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,970
that system and there are many many

00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:35,760
studies that show that there is bias

00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,799
insist

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,020
when you have only one way of thinking

00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:44,250
feeding that system so when you create

00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:46,980
diversity it smashes the bias and lastly

00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:50,299
I throw a challenge to all of you become

00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:53,400
an ally become an advocate for inclusion

00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:56,340
you can go to nCWIT dot-com

00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:59,340
org or you can go to any place on the

00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:02,549
website and study what it means to be a

00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:04,320
supporter of inclusion and an ally and

00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:06,360
there are many people in this room more

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,179
allies and I applaud you

00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:12,870
so go reach out to them and see how you

00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:15,110
can be an ally so I've got about two

00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:18,929
minutes and 37 seconds to tell you

00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:23,040
you're thrilled and happy to be an

00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:24,960
open-source supporter at Comcast this is

00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,760
kind of the logo that we're trying to

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,669
create and an identity around

00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,559
open-source at Comcast so you may see it

00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:34,679
on stickers you saw it first

00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:37,260
don't tell anyone and you may also see

00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:39,690
it in t-shirts and things like that if

00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:42,299
you are intrigued by the stock if you're

00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:44,850
intrigued by what we do at Comcast you
