Description: 
	The Apache Way for Business - Nick Burch, Apache Software Foundation

Wondering about how to best get involved in Apache projects or bring something new to the ASF? Struggling to understand how things work? Wishing you had a guide through all the mailing lists and online documentation? Figuring out how your business can engage with the projects that matter to it? Looking for just that one place you can turn to, to learn it all? Hunt no more!

Join a number of Apache old-hands for an interesting discussion on how businesses can engage with the ASF and its projects, what the "win" for those companies can be, and the odd (friendly!) tale of how not to do it...

About Nick Burch
Nick began contributing to Apache projects in 2003, and hasn't looked back since! He's mostly involved in "Content" projects like Apache POI, Apache Tika and Apache Chemistry, as well as foundation-wide activities like Conferences and Travel Assistance.

Nick is CTO at Quanticate, a Clinical Research Organisation (CRO) with a strong focus on data and statistics.

Nick has spoken at most ApacheCons since 2007, and as well as many industry events on Apache topics + others.

okay welcome everyone to our panel

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:12,509
session Apache way for business and I

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,630
have with me a hand-picked group of four

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:18,449
people who are not on the board at the

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,949
moment unfortunately we are clashing

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,920
with the board meeting and but I'm

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:26,010
hoping that between them we have a good

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,449
mix of experience different projects

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:32,910
different ages different levels of

00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:37,610
having been or nearly been incubated PMC

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,480
chair so you tell us a little bit about

00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:41,730
involving businesses in the Apache

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,860
Software Foundation building businesses

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,829
on top of it things that have worked

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,789
things that mainly didn't work quite so

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:53,879
well and perhaps also some sort of

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:56,059
warning signs for this incubating

00:00:53,879 --> 00:01:02,399
projectors going to need a bit more help

00:00:56,059 --> 00:01:04,379
before it's ready to graduate so what

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,180
I'd like to do is get a very brief

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,189
introduction from all of our panel and

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:13,290
then I'll kick off with some of the

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:15,720
questions we've got okay well I was

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:19,770
starting my name is Alfred Alma I've

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:22,939
been involved with Apache exchange 2004

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:26,490
or something and committed became

00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:29,490
committed here and been involved with

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:33,240
several projects still involved for

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:37,020
several projects nowadays the last few

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:40,380
years mostly as a mentor of watling's in

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:46,009
the incubator seen some hot links

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:50,610
graduate successfully like avatar or

00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:53,980
SSBB and currently mentoring NetBeans

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:58,470
and Apache streams

00:01:53,980 --> 00:02:01,440
yeah so it's my Ableton traitor

00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,370
hello everyone my name is Raman I

00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,810
apologize to my voice because I'm

00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:07,180
recovering from from a call but

00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:09,940
hopefully you can hear me all right

00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:12,670
so I've been involved in ffs since 2008

00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:15,970
roughly mostly in big data Hadoop

00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,050
ecosystem I actually used to be a VP of

00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,120
Apache Incubator

00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,520
you know mentor on a few projects so

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,830
spark I guess is you know the most

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,070
famous one out of everything that I've

00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,840
mentored so far and interestingly enough

00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:31,260
you know this involvement in Apache from

00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,460
the business / new projects perspective

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,040
naturally was partially responsible for

00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:38,080
lending me my current job which is at

00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,050
pivotal where I am director of open

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,000
source because pivotal at the time

00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:46,540
wanted to have somebody familiar with

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,910
open source to help them open source all

00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,680
of its data portfolio and you know

00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,890
including sort of legal side of it you

00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,210
know developer education you know sales

00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,160
basically the whole end-to-end you know

00:02:55,210 --> 00:03:02,100
business strategy plus you know actual

00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:04,450
execution so that was really unusual

00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,100
that you know something that I thought I

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,530
was doing just for fun and for free

00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:11,080
would all of a sudden you know lend me a

00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:13,150
job like I'm expected to be hired as a

00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:18,040
committer on foo but not as a you know

00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:19,959
incubator guy so that's me go hi

00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,140
everyone my name is Daniel Ruggeri and

00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:26,340
in the ASF I've been involved in the the

00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:30,730
web server project I guess since the

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:34,480
mid-2000s became committer in 2010 just

00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:36,790
became member earlier this year and I've

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,310
hung around the the community lists

00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:42,700
quite a bit because we do love our

00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:45,730
community here and then also sticking

00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,920
around with the incubator of it what's

00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,450
kind of neat similar to what you're

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,800
saying I'm coming at it from a different

00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:56,320
angle I'm actually in an industry where

00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:59,260
open-source is kind of weird so I'm one

00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:02,260
of our inter sourcing evangelists using

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:06,370
that as a foothold to kind of move our

00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,430
own stuff that we're doing in-house into

00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,410
the public

00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,900
so happy to talk with you guys about

00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:16,610
those things if you have such an

00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:19,489
interest and I'm John Eamon I actually

00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:21,800
came to the incubator in 2011 as part of

00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:23,570
a new pod Ling and have kind of stuck

00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,610
around since you probably know my name

00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,950
from the board reports and having to

00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:30,110
remind everyone to actually get their

00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:36,220
report out there so we have something of

00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:41,660
substance I am worth Tamiya and Juno and

00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:43,070
now agent and I area Tosca and probably

00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,410
a few other problems that I can't think

00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,970
of a pub my hat trying to get them

00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,310
through the rest of the incubator and

00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,860
get them promoted to top level projects

00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,200
and similar to what Roman and Daniel

00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,150
just talked about I am also working on

00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,060
trying to get some internal software

00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,800
open source throughout my company to get

00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:07,100
them actually contributing back more and

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:08,510
more open source okay so I am been going

00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,150
around the conference the last couple of

00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:13,900
days picking people's brains on what

00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:17,000
topics they'd like us to cover today and

00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:20,090
I'm going to try and have us tell a

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,570
story ticking off as many of those as

00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,450
possible

00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,860
and please do grab the mic if you feel

00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,890
you have something to say on the topic

00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:31,130
or you've got something to contribute so

00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:35,690
the first one that comes up especially

00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:37,990
with newer companies coming into the ASF

00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:42,020
they sort of come along and say either

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:45,470
what's all this about individuals or how

00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,910
do I get five of my staff to be

00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,130
committers on this project that I've

00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:51,470
just decided is really important and

00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:54,200
someone talked on the the individuals

00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:56,350
and the why that matters for the second

00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,350
question

00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:06,620
I guess I can definitely take a stab at

00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:08,480
that the reason I reached out for the

00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,780
mic is because I also happen to be an

00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,370
employee of Linux Foundation which is a

00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,530
different way of doing open-source

00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,270
collaborative projects and with Linux

00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:19,010
foundation it is all about companies in

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,570
a way right you know because with Linux

00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,520
Foundation developers of course do

00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,530
matter but at the end of the day it's

00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,330
companies agreeing on the governance and

00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,830
sort of the bylaws and you know how the

00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,300
project is structured and what it means

00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,780
to be a committer and what it means to

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,830
be on a P and C if there is such a thing

00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:36,110
and it's just a different way of

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,300
governing I mean I'm not saying that one

00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,100
is better than the other actually

00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,690
nowadays that I'm also an employee of

00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,070
Linux Foundation it would be weird for

00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,450
me to say that one is better than the

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,940
other issues that different right and

00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:48,440
explaining that difference is probably

00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,419
the first step that you go through when

00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,250
a new company comes and tries to

00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:55,640
open-source something or you know

00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:57,230
suggested to Apache because it may very

00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:01,430
well be the case that Apache is not a

00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:03,200
good place for them so like us asking

00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,700
this you know there is a certain

00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,380
presumption that of course the answer is

00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,150
no like you know we of course we should

00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,950
tell those companies that it's all about

00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,620
individuals and you cannot really just

00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:16,340
make committers really nearly well you

00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:18,470
can just not with itself so if you know

00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,060
github works for you great if you know

00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,800
Linux Foundation works for you great

00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,320
it's just ASF happens to be opinionated

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,790
about very few things but the ones that

00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,710
we opinionated about we're really

00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,810
strongly opinionated about and what I

00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,760
find super useful is just getting it out

00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:33,680
there as quickly as possible because the

00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,150
list is not big you know you can

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,220
basically articulate that list within

00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,080
you know 15 20 minutes and say like

00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,500
here's the stuff we will absolutely not

00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,729
budge on everything else is negotiable

00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,650
so to me that's kind of like that how

00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:49,160
you open the conversation and then

00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:53,720
everything else flows you know from that

00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:57,200
set of non-negotiable principles yeah I

00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:00,110
can actually agree on that I think I can

00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:04,940
also give an other angle on that my

00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:07,280
company HIPAA is really providing an

00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,279
open source product which is Apache

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,459
License

00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:15,179
and spin so since I think 2005 already

00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:18,959
so we've been kind of having a logical

00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:21,959
and natural tie in the way of thing in

00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:25,229
the Apache way and for us as a company

00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:30,149
to participate and contribute to the ASF

00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:33,120
is the natural thing to do because we

00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:36,560
rely on like eighty ninety percent of

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:40,529
our code base is itself based on Apache

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,689
projects and we build our product on top

00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:46,680
of it which is again apache license but

00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:50,490
so we rely heavily on the health and the

00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:52,250
durability of the underlying stack where

00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:55,379
we building our product upon so

00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:58,079
contributing and participating in these

00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:59,459
projects is like fundamental thing for

00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:03,120
us to to do so

00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:08,370
it's just gardening and in supporting

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:14,160
our own underlying stack and and another

00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:17,639
thing in that is we rely on these apart

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,309
C projects we also contributing on a

00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:22,889
project of our which we didn't started

00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:25,019
in the Apache foundation but the point

00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:29,160
is not so much to get it in the open

00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:33,089
source or get it at Apache as such it's

00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:37,319
more like the Apache way of sharing the

00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:39,420
projects having multiple parties and

00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:42,089
people involved in that so you get a

00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:45,660
diversity and that gives a lower

00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:47,790
lifeline and insurance that what you

00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:52,439
might want to take out of that project

00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:54,779
is not necessarily the only way and by

00:09:52,439 --> 00:09:57,990
having multiple people contribute on

00:09:54,779 --> 00:10:01,050
that from a diverse set of companies or

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:03,629
individual participants on that you

00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:06,389
actually build a stronger products give

00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:09,660
a much longer durability of that so for

00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:13,399
us it's well the natural thing to do and

00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:17,449
it's just guarding our own product

00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:17,449
foundation in the long run

00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:24,040
well and then also that one of the final

00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:27,580
things to point out as a 501c3

00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:30,640
we cannot give any particular special

00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:33,570
benefit to any particular special entity

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:37,480
such as a business so it really is

00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:40,269
software as public good so if one

00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,790
company kind of owns the PMC of any

00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:45,160
particular project that could put tax

00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:51,490
status at risk right and nobody wants to

00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:54,550
deal with that okay I'm relating to the

00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:57,130
individuals thing and one thing that we

00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:59,800
sometimes try and educate the companies

00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:01,839
with is that having your staff involved

00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,750
in an Apache project is a good thing for

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,899
the staff member and makes them happier

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:09,730
then we want to touch on some of the

00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:12,550
employee benefits type stuff from that

00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,870
which so I'll be one of the I'll jump

00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:17,649
right into that because I have the mic

00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:22,180
so um so what kind of tell my own story

00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:24,850
uh I am absolutely floored that through

00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:26,170
my involvement in the project I've met

00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,510
some really great people I've been

00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,910
exposed to some really great ideas my

00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:34,420
professional network my personal network

00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:38,350
has grown quite a bit so I mean it's

00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:41,500
really obvious to say Oh Daniel just

00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:43,149
joined this community he's submersed in

00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,459
some of the most brilliant minds in the

00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:48,490
world how could how could that not be a

00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:51,540
good thing right I mean it just seems so

00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,540
obvious to me so

00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:58,260
so I'll add two then say it's really

00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:02,910
great to even see your own open source

00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:04,290
in using your commercial products it is

00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,790
not everything is going to be open

00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,650
source and I think we all understand

00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:10,020
that and the apache license is focused

00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:11,750
on the fact that there is a difference

00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,580
between your commercial products your

00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,230
open-source products and being able to

00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,330
leverage that being able to draw both

00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:21,060
internal ideas and external ideas from

00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:23,490
the community to try to build the

00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:26,160
open-source pieces makes it so that your

00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:28,260
notoriety is out there your public nook

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,610
recognition over what you're doing is

00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,470
something that's just coming up

00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:33,030
constantly assuming that what you're

00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:38,670
working on is a great project that lots

00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:41,490
of people are using and interestingly

00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:44,130
enough what I also found very sort of

00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:47,910
compelling is when you explain to

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:51,270
developers that ASF basically functions

00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:52,650
as a constitution you know Eve those

00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,270
developers from the corporation

00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:57,630
contribute to NSF project they have

00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:59,490
certain rights just like anybody who is

00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:02,160
subject to a constitution you know has a

00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:04,740
certain set of rights and a lot of those

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,210
rights actually have help in dealing

00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,540
with what's typically known as

00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:11,220
managerial so when somebody

00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,220
tells you when somebody tells you like

00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:16,020
go and you know fix this you know

00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,850
without opening in JIRA because you know

00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:21,330
maybe we found the security hole and

00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:23,160
don't tell anybody like if it's just

00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,660
your boss telling you to do that on an

00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,000
internal project it's not really much

00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,680
you can do if it's your boss telling you

00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,010
to do that on an Apache project there's

00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,990
a lot you can do and not in a defiant

00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,670
sense not in this like well this is

00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:38,100
 I'm not going to do this but

00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:40,860
it's like no if we do this we will get

00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,720
kicked out of incubator or SF I cannot

00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,060
do it not because I am you know just

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,650
define you I cannot do it because it

00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,230
will jeopardize the project and that

00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:50,940
works extremely well not a single

00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,710
company wants to be a poster child for

00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,930
the first project that got kicked out of

00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:57,450
SF because they violated you know the

00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,950
Constitution so yeah you know when you

00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:01,320
explain it to developers especially you

00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,700
know the ones that have been subject to

00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,500
the sort of closed source development

00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,279
they're like yeah we want to

00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,339
yourself--and

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,509
you know that's how you get them going

00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:14,189
yeah that's a good point

00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:16,980
I'd like to add and I mean that I agree

00:14:14,189 --> 00:14:21,120
but it's kind of the negative energy

00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:26,069
owner for my company it's actually

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:28,860
beneficial to being an open source

00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:33,540
project and actually our product is used

00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:35,279
by large organizations like Dutch

00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:43,290
government and governmental

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:45,300
organizations really find the and by the

00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:49,800
fact that it's open source and backed by

00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:54,870
a SF or Apache License Communities a

00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:57,889
really strong point in entrusting the

00:14:54,870 --> 00:15:02,699
company and contributing and honoring

00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:05,699
the the quality of the product itself so

00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:08,399
the fact that we have several committees

00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:13,370
within the company who on an individual

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:17,819
basis participate at the ASF kind of

00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:21,079
also showcases to our customers that the

00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:23,939
company truly is of good faith and and

00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:26,730
investing in that and in doing the thing

00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:29,699
beyond just commercial benefit of the

00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:32,939
company company alone so that's a major

00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:36,120
added value I think not just for the

00:15:32,939 --> 00:15:38,569
employee itself but throughout to him

00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,970
also to the company

00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:44,100
okay so staffing last week with a

00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:46,769
company interested in getting involved

00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,199
in an Apache project and they said we've

00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:51,600
got some money and we've got a couple of

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:55,259
developers and we really want this new

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:59,160
feature adding to project name removed

00:15:55,259 --> 00:16:01,529
to avoid embarrassment and how do we do

00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,720
it like I tried ringing up the

00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:04,829
sponsorship team and said you know hey

00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,679
can I give you some money to at that

00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:09,240
feature and they just said no what what

00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,579
am I supposed to do I've got money I've

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,860
got developers help me what are we what

00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:18,800
do we say to those well-meaning but

00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:18,800
confused people who want to help

00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,180
[Laughter]

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,480
start off by reaching out to that

00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:33,279
community we see a lot of males on

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:35,470
comdev and on webmaster and incubator or

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,779
general as saying we want to add this

00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,430
feature it's great that your start

00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:41,050
trying to start at a top level but you

00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,820
really need to focus on the actual

00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:45,070
project and talk to that project

00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:47,320
directly to figure out what can you do

00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,850
to contribute this back it could be that

00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,740
they're used to doing things like JIRA

00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,930
tickets with patches or they're used to

00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,220
doing get a pull request if the reach

00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:56,080
out to that community first figure out

00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,089
what works best for them it's going to

00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,950
be different project project nope too

00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:01,779
profitable a lot of projects do operate

00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:04,689
the same way but not every project

00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:07,319
operates with a consistent mantra of

00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:12,699
what it is they're doing

00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:14,650
really yeah I actually love this

00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:16,780
question because it pops up all the time

00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:18,520
when I talk to companies as well and I

00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,800
think you know the analogy I sort of

00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,170
finally settled on is this like I'm a

00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:28,780
big football fan not you know American

00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:30,700
football the real one so whenever the

00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,860
company asked that question it says

00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,780
though they're asking a question we have

00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,610
this favorite team of ours but it seems

00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:39,790
to be losing all the time how can we

00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:42,220
help what do we do to make it win like

00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:44,140
do we go to FIFA and give FIFA some

00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,820
money well I guess you could do that it

00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,160
doesn't do you any good but you know it

00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:50,650
actually gets you in trouble as we found

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,110
out you know recently but it's not how

00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:55,210
it operates right well if you want to

00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,590
help you actually find that like you

00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:58,780
reach out to the club right you know you

00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:00,280
reached out to the team that is losing

00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,440
and that team is typically operating as

00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,580
a club right and within that club you

00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,320
can basically have all sorts of

00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,790
conversations maybe it's a different

00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,679
player that needs to be brought onto the

00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,090
team right maybe it's somebody from a

00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:12,610
different club that the club doesn't

00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:14,710
have money to you know buy from you know

00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:16,210
some other club but if you donate some

00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,100
extra money you know that player can be

00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:20,380
bought now does it guarantee that the

00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,150
team will win absolutely not but at

00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,160
least you increase their chances the

00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,690
same way it works with SF right if you

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,220
want your project to actually develop a

00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:29,500
future you reach out to the community

00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,850
and you can even pay people within or

00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,350
outside the community

00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:34,270
you know s contractors to develop the

00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:36,100
switch is it guaranteed that the feature

00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,210
will be developed for your specification

00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,860
absolutely not

00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:41,020
but if you found the right people at

00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:45,400
least they would give it the best try

00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:50,160
they could possibly give it and yes and

00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:53,740
then that feature should align with the

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,990
community goals of the project itself

00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:59,290
that's that's the first rule so if you

00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:01,600
want something which is like completely

00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:05,350
opposite direction of what the community

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,420
is going towards you can't throw it much

00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:10,450
money and add it if you want to but it's

00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:12,910
not likely to succeed at all so first of

00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:16,510
all you need you have two ways of doing

00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:19,540
it either you build up a strong story

00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:23,230
which will convince and bring interest

00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:27,790
from that community for the feature you

00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:30,220
want to get get realized then it's more

00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:34,090
like an arc anything if you get people

00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:36,580
as interested in that feature typically

00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:39,220
the community will pick it up and you

00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:41,890
might need to invest some time and an

00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:44,310
effort in supporting people like from

00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:48,690
your own company developers who start

00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:52,300
participating in the community feeding

00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:54,700
duratec ads or or actually well in time

00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,770
become committees on their own but all

00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,110
in all it's still the direction of the

00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:02,550
projects in the community who will

00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:05,290
decide what the end result will be so

00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:07,530
truly if you want some feature delivered

00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:09,340
in a project join the project

00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:12,370
participate in the project

00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:14,590
and align with the vision and the

00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:18,130
thoughts go on there and if you want

00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:21,910
stuff changed do a little bit more work

00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:25,270
and gradually grow into that community

00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:27,250
and see if you can make people within

00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:30,280
they're interested in the direction you

00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:32,590
want to go that's the road to successful

00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,750
distance and then a related question we

00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:37,240
sometimes get is when this was my

00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:39,550
project before I get to guess F I could

00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,419
say we're going to have one point naught

00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:46,840
next Tuesday

00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:49,630
do I have any control do I have any way

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:52,149
of trying to meet these things

00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:54,399
especially since next week my CEO is

00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:57,630
standing up on stage and I can't really

00:20:54,399 --> 00:21:00,159
slip the release date of the conference

00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:04,389
yeah what do we say to them about how

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:07,720
they can it's kind of the same question

00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:11,399
in my book it's it's even more unlikely

00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:14,320
to succeed to say next week something

00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:16,659
unless you're already have that whole

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,419
community aligned and everybody's

00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:20,919
already focusing on getting this lift

00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:23,799
and it's still you have no guarantee

00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:26,860
because there are some rules too to be

00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:30,039
applied and sanity checks validation

00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:34,539
checks and and you're not as a company

00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:37,360
owning that process they're typically

00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:40,539
a good diversity of different

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:43,000
participants and they're all individuals

00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:46,120
there's no one company on in there who

00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,309
have a say in that process and if you

00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,210
get everyone in convinced and working

00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:54,190
towards that girl yes you have a chance

00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:57,070
but you already should be more or less

00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:59,169
part of the whole process to begin with

00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:01,659
- you can make a claim like that and

00:21:59,169 --> 00:22:05,139
then still it's not a claim it's it's a

00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:07,899
kind of hope and suggestion and you can

00:22:05,139 --> 00:22:11,399
pull that off but only if you are right

00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:14,980
track within the community theater

00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:17,289
actually I guess I will not necessarily

00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:20,760
disagree with this viewpoint just maybe

00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:22,899
offer you know an alternative one

00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:25,419
honestly I'm a big believer in

00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:28,120
separating projects and products so

00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:31,029
going back to your CEO question the CEO

00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:33,130
can totally go on stage today or you

00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:35,230
know a couple of hours from now and say

00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:37,000
whatever he or she wants about the

00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:39,639
product that the company is producing

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,440
because that is the brand that is fully

00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:43,480
controlled by the company now that

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,399
product may be 90 percent based on the

00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,710
Apache project or even you know 99

00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:49,149
percent based on the Apache project but

00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,740
that's fine it's still a separate brand

00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:53,200
it's something that the company controls

00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:55,020
now if the same statement needs to be

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,010
applied to a project

00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,870
obviously of course you're absolutely

00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:59,730
right I mean you just simply cannot do

00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:01,590
that but that separation between product

00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:05,280
products and projects I think it's very

00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:07,500
healthy and the textbook example of why

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,540
it could be a problem if you conflate

00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,790
the two he has recently been in the news

00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:13,410
with docker you know basically splitting

00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,820
out the whole Moby thing you know and

00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:17,580
everybody's like what's that Marty and

00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:19,020
likewise docker now docker everybody was

00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,610
confused because they actually conflated

00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,010
the two so for a long time docker was

00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:24,690
product and project at the same time now

00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,190
project is called Moby as it should have

00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:28,200
been you know a different name from the

00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:30,210
get-go and the product is still docker

00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:36,690
so not confusing the tool from the very

00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:38,670
early on helps build businesses so one

00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:40,680
thing I'll add to that is having a

00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:43,320
release through any open source project

00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:45,450
is just like trying to drive an agile

00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,470
team to the delivery of your sprinkles

00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:50,310
you can aim as best as you can to

00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,440
delivering meeting every feature

00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:54,420
requirement meeting every need that

00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:58,320
comes up but at the end of the day until

00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:59,880
it's ships it's not complete so that CEO

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,340
it doesn't matter if they're trying to

00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,430
say apache couchdb is being released

00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:07,530
next week or my internal product based

00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:10,530
on kalsi be is being released next week

00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:12,300
it's going to be as up to the community

00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:16,760
as best as they can actually deliver

00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:19,530
that feature set to meet those goals

00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:22,290
well and then I'll just repeat what you

00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:24,240
said is if you want to drive the

00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:25,770
community join the community if you want

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,190
to set some certain goals for the

00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:30,930
project join the project make them make

00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:33,360
the project feel like you're part of the

00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:34,500
project and not you know some vested

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,300
commercial interest that's on the

00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,970
outside because that's a quick way to

00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:41,700
piss people off right so join the

00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:43,380
project contributes show that you bring

00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:46,260
value all the time and then when you

00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:49,520
have an itch to scratch the community is

00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,520
much more likely to hear it

00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:59,110
I can may be given a small example on

00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:01,389
how we do this within a company so our

00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:03,970
product have realized on a taxi

00:25:01,389 --> 00:25:05,919
Jackrabbit which we have several

00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:09,340
communities participating that as well

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:12,249
but our product is called hippo

00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:14,350
repository so this is like our branded

00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:17,649
version of Jackrabbit we have some added

00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:21,249
features on that so we typically have

00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:25,059
our own release cable that so while we

00:25:21,249 --> 00:25:29,049
would like to have our improvements or

00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:31,749
certain fixes to be released like just

00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:33,580
before we could release but we totally

00:25:31,749 --> 00:25:38,499
not dependent on that because what we

00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:39,519
maintain is our light Fork of the Apache

00:25:38,499 --> 00:25:42,669
Jackrabbit

00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:45,850
so we maintain a minimal set of patches

00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:49,509
and that grows in and reduces over time

00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:51,850
so independent of if those patches have

00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:54,279
been merged and accepted within a

00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:57,039
passage record or even accepted but not

00:25:54,279 --> 00:26:00,399
yet released we are independent of that

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:02,590
release ready and as soon as we have

00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:05,470
like a final draw in the sand for our

00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:07,169
product of course we do our best to keep

00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:10,419
our fork

00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:12,639
patches back and get them upstream in

00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:14,470
air passage Jackrabbit and sometimes it

00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:16,720
takes a little bit more time sometimes a

00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:19,059
little bit less time but you should

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,999
never rely on that dependency and that's

00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:24,669
just fine because that's the good thing

00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:28,690
of the Apache and the Apache License we

00:26:24,669 --> 00:26:32,320
are totally free to grant it and have a

00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:35,409
fork of that and be independent of the

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,759
whole process so the the forking thing

00:26:35,409 --> 00:26:41,049
is interesting because you sometimes get

00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:42,549
companies that are new to the AFS maybe

00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:45,159
on an existing project to come and say

00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:48,850
wait so this isn't like the GPL I can

00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:52,389
like take your toys and go home why

00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:54,340
would anyone ever contribute back can

00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:57,009
any one kind of touch on what you need

00:26:54,340 --> 00:27:00,269
to say about why you maybe don't want to

00:26:57,009 --> 00:27:00,269
why you maybe should

00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:05,390
so this is a this is a fundamental

00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:08,510
question I guess about open source not

00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:10,190
necessarily within the ASF but what

00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:12,740
would you not want to contribute back

00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:14,840
would probably be the things that are

00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:17,540
your secret sauce that this is the only

00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:21,110
way you can make business or reach your

00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:24,020
business goals or differentiate yourself

00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:26,540
from competitors but on the flip side is

00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:30,650
if you're maintaining that special sauce

00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:32,480
that's on you to do forever and that's

00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:36,140
maintenance that's work that you have to

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,150
prepare for there's that the answer I

00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:41,630
usually give when when folks are asking

00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:42,800
about open source is you should open

00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:45,110
source all of the things that

00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,670
everybody's got to do if everybody's got

00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:48,260
to do it there's no reason why you would

00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:49,790
want to keep it behind and own that

00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,900
maintenance and he's got a oh no

00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:53,180
maintenance and he's got auto

00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:55,670
maintenance that's a shared playground

00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:57,320
let's just all be on the same playing

00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:58,760
field and then we can compete in places

00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,490
that are actually really cool and

00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:04,340
interesting so that that would basically

00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:05,900
be how I respond and then the second

00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:07,940
part is it just sucks maintaining things

00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:12,440
that you know if you could give it back

00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:14,750
you should okay

00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:18,170
I don't Sona on a related one

00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:20,720
particularly a happy question would any

00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:23,300
of you like to share a big wing you got

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,340
for your company from the day job when I

00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:27,890
said currently job by contributing

00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:30,140
something back getting a getting a

00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:35,150
private fork squished back to upstream

00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:36,680
and back tracking the community I don't

00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:39,200
know if I well I would say there's been

00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:41,660
several small wins and that's the cool

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,430
part I mean not participating on the web

00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:45,430
server project as you can imagine I've

00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:48,620
run a lot of web servers at my day job

00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:50,750
and there were several things that the

00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:52,940
way we use it or the environment was a

00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:55,670
little peculiar so we were able to

00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:57,380
contribute back some features that made

00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:59,540
things work a whole lot better for us

00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:03,260
and it also made the project itself

00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:04,610
better so I would say it's a it's a big

00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:07,640
win because it's a win for the community

00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:08,870
it's a win for us and it was constant

00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,530
right it wasn't any one particular

00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:16,790
patches a series of patches that

00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:18,440
we get a lot of benefit from I feel

00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:22,220
would like to add to that from a

00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:24,710
different perspective not necessarily a

00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:27,530
company perspective but a customer so we

00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:29,830
basically had a customer who had to

00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:33,020
maintain essentially a set of plugins

00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:34,940
into a product that had to be revved up

00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:37,220
you know when you rev up the product

00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:39,560
itself and they were actually you know

00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:41,810
there was a some portion of a contract

00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,790
dedicated to it and we explained to them

00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:45,080
that they can actually take that code

00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:47,690
that'll push it back into the main

00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,670
project they're like and then we don't

00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:52,160
have to maintain it anymore and we don't

00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:54,050
have to pay anybody and like here if

00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:57,200
community accepts your contribution like

00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:59,000
yourself like awesome let's do it so we

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,070
help them you know just coach them you

00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:06,650
know jiriz whatnot then now they don't

00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:09,500
have to pay anybody yeah from a maybe

00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:11,960
different destructor but I mean we our

00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:16,310
product ish is right by big companies

00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:20,900
with a lot closer setups of our CMS

00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:23,300
product and they sometimes they they hit

00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:25,610
some clustering problem and locking

00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:27,620
problem so we really had to go into

00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:29,240
dairy environment fixing the problems

00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,490
and then figuring out it's actually

00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:36,380
something which should be fixed upstream

00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:39,800
so more or less they paid us to fix the

00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:42,440
bug and we pushed it upstream so

00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:46,550
actually they indirect they were paying

00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:49,040
for sharing improvement and fixes for

00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:51,430
the whole community to direct the

00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,430
benefit

00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:59,400
so I can tell you from my own experience

00:30:55,970 --> 00:31:01,670
we fixed a number of security holes and

00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:04,530
performance issues in a patchy user grid

00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:08,070
this was a long time ago we ran into a

00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:10,140
number of database constraint issues

00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:12,030
where there were just too many app

00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:15,120
servers trying to update the same rows

00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:17,040
in Cassandra and was causing really bad

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,040
performance in our environment we got to

00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:22,290
a point where 10 concurrent clients were

00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:24,810
able to cause these sorts problems we

00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:27,120
were able to also run provide input to

00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:30,030
security insights that we were seeing

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:33,000
from private security scanning as well

00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:35,460
as just public intrusion detection that

00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,010
we were able to do to provide these

00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:40,460
security patches to the project so that

00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:42,720
we didn't have to maintain it and keep

00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:45,150
everyone secure who is using these

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,520
projects so it's not only us who are

00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:49,410
benefitting it but we're able to see

00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,240
others in the community be able to take

00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:53,370
these patches in and actually work with

00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,630
the software and know that at least

00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:58,130
these security holes that were

00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:58,130
identified are now fixed

00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:09,870
Thanks so um one thing that sometimes

00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:15,480
flares up with new projects is someone

00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:18,920
in marketing said something maybe foo

00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:22,320
cult is the company behind Apache Hadoop

00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:27,000
maybe it's foo Corp have just released

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:29,700
foo and it upsets a lot of people and if

00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,290
you're lucky enough to have Allen

00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,660
working for you and you've set your

00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:35,100
marketers through the trainings that

00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:41,400
he's done then maybe that wouldn't

00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:43,110
happen but for any for projects that are

00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:46,710
coming in and if you're mentoring them

00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:49,880
how do you help the engineers help the

00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,880
rest of their company to change

00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:56,860
well I I think you just have to explain

00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,420
it in the terms that you know the

00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,710
marketing people can understand and they

00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:02,410
understand extremely well what it means

00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:04,150
to use a brand you know just like they

00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:05,860
understand that you know using a Mickey

00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:07,750
Mouse or you know Disney song in the

00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:11,290
presentation would probably not be a

00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:13,420
good idea once you sort of explain it in

00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:15,460
those terms they're like oh so you're

00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:18,400
telling you that the source code is free

00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:21,610
but the brand is not and I'd be like

00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:24,700
yeah that's what it is and then they

00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:26,320
actually get to be very reasonable

00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,570
because those are the terms that they

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,730
used to I think a lot of times it

00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:32,620
happens because the assumption is that

00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:35,200
because the code is available under an

00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:37,330
extremely permissive license the brand

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:43,360
itself is also available under the same

00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:45,610
license which is just not the case so I

00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,140
can add to that I think it's also

00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:49,690
important when you're coming in as a

00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:51,370
paddling if you are using that name and

00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,970
that is somehow indicative of your

00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:54,160
company

00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:56,740
that is not the name to give to the

00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,780
paddling the project that's actually

00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:01,270
powering it should be separate from your

00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:04,810
corporate entity so that means that if

00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:06,730
your company is named foo you should not

00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:08,409
create a paddling called foo you have to

00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:11,020
come up with a new name for that project

00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:13,300
that correctly describes what that

00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:15,250
project is doing that is independent of

00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,960
the corporate backing behind it and

00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:18,730
keeping that separation is very

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,970
important and actually helps in a lot of

00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:23,770
these situations at the same time there

00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:26,530
are cases where you do have to go and

00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:28,540
try to reach out directly to the

00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:31,300
marketing people there to get some of

00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:33,159
these press releases fixed and that is

00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:35,889
an unfortunate thing to do but there are

00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:37,240
cases where the engineers aren't going

00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:42,510
to be comfortable enough having that

00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:42,510
conversation but they may be willing to

00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:51,039
and I'm adding to that I think everybody

00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:54,309
also should realize that one of the the

00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:58,950
strengths of the Apache way is that is

00:34:54,309 --> 00:35:02,109
indeed the diversity so if you as a

00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:06,369
company are backing a certain project or

00:35:02,109 --> 00:35:10,509
supporting it if you try to change that

00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:13,079
project its brand you might shy off some

00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:15,400
competitors and other people in the

00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:18,789
marketplace to actually contribute to

00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,589
that project because they don't want to

00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:24,579
contribute to a project who is actually

00:35:20,589 --> 00:35:27,339
like claiming to be well controlled or

00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:29,950
steered by one of your competitors so

00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:34,269
actually you're draining the lifeline of

00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:36,819
your project itself by dealing so truly

00:35:34,269 --> 00:35:39,069
by keeping that separate you keeping the

00:35:36,819 --> 00:35:41,069
level playing field for everybody to

00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:43,809
participate which in the long run

00:35:41,069 --> 00:35:45,880
guarantee issue or gives you a more

00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:48,279
guarantee on on the quality in the

00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:51,039
duration of the project so you're

00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:54,069
actually cutting your own finger if

00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:55,839
you're trying to claim it because you're

00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:59,890
cutting like a lifeline

00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:01,960
it's literally letting blood run would

00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:04,539
someone like to channel an inner shame

00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:08,609
and give a quick explanation of what not

00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:08,609
to do when one of these things happen

00:36:13,059 --> 00:36:24,910
so what would what we can do here now

00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:28,400
yeah thanks go on Twitter so I guess

00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:31,640
first of all are all the pot lengths and

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,339
definitely TLPs PMC's should be familiar

00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,839
with the branding guidelines that exist

00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:38,180
and are well documented I mean they're

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,609
not too many things that are extremely

00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:42,530
well documented you know at the patria

00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:44,270
branding guidelines actually one of

00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:46,010
those things that are extremely well

00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:48,109
documented and you know not difficult to

00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:49,880
understand at all so I encourage you all

00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:51,980
of my paddling's to basically go and

00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:56,059
read them and just sort of internalize

00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:59,089
them now then uh the explanation that I

00:36:56,059 --> 00:37:02,450
try to give them is they are not meant

00:36:59,089 --> 00:37:04,069
to be enforcement of those sort of

00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:05,630
guidelines if it comes you know if push

00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:07,430
comes to shove I mean they're not they

00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:09,109
not meant to be the people sort of you

00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:11,180
know trading emails with the company

00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:12,940
lawyers you know trying to explain to

00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:16,970
the company not to do something right

00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:19,250
but they're all meant to be in support

00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:21,290
of the guidelines that are documented

00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:24,230
which means that if they see something

00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:27,890
that is off at least they should send a

00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:30,740
note to the PMC's mailing list you know

00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:33,260
in private if if that requires to be in

00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:35,059
private just saying hey you know I've

00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:37,670
noticed that this company is doing this

00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:39,680
like are you guys feeling that this is

00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:41,750
the right thing to do you know what's

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,460
everybody's take and I think as long as

00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:45,890
we can basically encourage people to

00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:49,520
keep track of what's going on around

00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:51,770
them and not not become complacent not

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,660
saying that well you know all these

00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,910
companies do it or like if this company

00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:58,640
does it it's fine all of them do it so

00:37:55,910 --> 00:38:00,770
just fight that complacency try to bring

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,859
issues back to the PMC's mailing list

00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:06,799
and then you know these solutions are

00:38:03,859 --> 00:38:08,720
typically reasonable because a lot of

00:38:06,799 --> 00:38:10,790
times you know just a single email from

00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:14,020
a chair of the project back to the

00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:16,640
corporate you know email address

00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,329
marketing at company name you know or

00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,280
somesuch

00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:20,540
would do the trick I mean the companies

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,099
would actually actually just say like

00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:23,890
thank you we didn't know you know we

00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:25,630
fixed it whatever it was

00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:27,010
sometimes you know they wouldn't respond

00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:30,130
and then you would basically include it

00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:32,400
into the report that you're submitting

00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:34,810
to the board or if it's you know

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,460
significant enough of a violation you

00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:39,100
may even flag it to the board you know

00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:40,990
sooner then your next report and then

00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:43,030
it's literally up to the board to help

00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:46,240
you deal with that right again they will

00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:48,910
tell you to do certain set of things but

00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,950
at the end of the day if it really gets

00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:53,170
tough you know the board will get

00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:56,290
involved and SF actually does have legal

00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:57,430
resources to even send seasoned receipt

00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:59,650
letters you know if it comes to that

00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:01,600
like I haven't actually done it once and

00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:11,920
I haven't seen it done even once

00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:13,630
but those legal resources exist what

00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,150
I've seen in trademarks is it actually

00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:19,480
should direct them to trademarks and

00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:20,950
then Shane can handle it and he can

00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,320
connect with a lawyer so it's more of an

00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:26,440
officers type thing than a board thing

00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:28,180
yep but there yeah I bet I agree with

00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,070
all I'm saying is and maybe yeah maybe

00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:33,220
that's just my inner mentor you know

00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:37,210
speaking I like keeping board appraised

00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:39,430
of just about everything and even if all

00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:41,050
we did is you know we sent the you know

00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:43,540
email to let's say trademark said Apache

00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:45,910
org even that has to go into the report

00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:47,290
so that's that's all I'm saying um I

00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:49,090
also want to comment on this whole but

00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:51,070
one thing we've told our people

00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:53,440
internally and found is it's much better

00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:54,940
to get those like if the marketer goes

00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,470
off the rails it's much better to hear

00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:58,390
that internally than to get called out

00:39:56,470 --> 00:40:00,369
on the list so you shouldn't actually

00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:02,710
feel bad about telling your own company

00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:04,780
hey that's not going to work because

00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:09,070
they'd rather hear it from you than from

00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:10,330
Apache officially so absolutely

00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:12,730
something we tell our people is please

00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:19,119
be even more diligent in policing us

00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:21,190
than than the outside yeah I would agree

00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:23,470
with that as so fourth of all what

00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:26,859
you're suggesting is somebody on the

00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:30,000
community see something off then indeed

00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:34,600
I would suggest the first direction is

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:38,500
notifying the PMC preferably private so

00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:42,210
within the PMC you likely will have one

00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:46,270
of the participants being an employer of

00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:48,910
the company in question and so the

00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:53,109
natural path and in the ideal path would

00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:56,980
be this is then resolved internally and

00:40:53,109 --> 00:41:00,100
and doesn't need to escalate to public

00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:02,740
or trademark or stuff like that so first

00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:07,000
of all I think the PMC is the first find

00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:09,580
responsible entity to to monitor and

00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,850
being aware and if need be

00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:15,369
escalate the problem but anyone in the

00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:19,420
community if you see something which you

00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:23,560
think this is our intake initiative to

00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:25,570
notify the PMC privately and then see

00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,520
how and they probably will respond

00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:30,400
they're huge so you will be aware even

00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,490
if you're not on the BMC and then it

00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:36,400
will take next steps after that

00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:39,160
typically it should the most cases it's

00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,560
just somebody misunderstanding the

00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:44,859
problem that this situation and it can

00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:48,070
be easily resolved in practice if it

00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:50,650
hasn't gone wild on Twitter yes so

00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:53,850
that's what I meant don't do a private

00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:56,410
can see you know I not thredUP

00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:58,720
okay well we've got a few minutes left

00:41:56,410 --> 00:42:02,470
so would anyone like to pose a question

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:09,480
with the panel any members like to chip

00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:09,480
in with anything okay

00:42:14,229 --> 00:42:20,469
at the outset there was mention about

00:42:16,929 --> 00:42:22,839
maybe talking about running businesses

00:42:20,469 --> 00:42:25,719
off of apache software or trying to

00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:28,989
commercialize apache software maybe you

00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:36,069
have any thoughts on things to do or not

00:42:28,989 --> 00:42:38,019
do to try to make that happen so one

00:42:36,069 --> 00:42:40,529
area that i've seen be very successful

00:42:38,019 --> 00:42:43,569
with this is providing support and

00:42:40,529 --> 00:42:45,759
consulting opportunities on top of the

00:42:43,569 --> 00:42:48,189
apache products you're not violating

00:42:45,759 --> 00:42:49,659
anything about the brand you're making

00:42:48,189 --> 00:42:52,239
it very clear that you can assist with

00:42:49,659 --> 00:42:55,779
the implementation the delivery the

00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:57,699
setup of these Apache products while not

00:42:55,779 --> 00:43:00,759
violating anything about the core

00:42:57,699 --> 00:43:02,739
deliverables of those products Hadoop

00:43:00,759 --> 00:43:04,989
would be a good example of this where

00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:06,969
you can actually go on site and help set

00:43:04,989 --> 00:43:09,939
up a twenty five thousand node cluster

00:43:06,969 --> 00:43:11,379
for someone and that makes a lot of

00:43:09,939 --> 00:43:14,319
sense because that's not something you

00:43:11,379 --> 00:43:18,219
would expect from the project to do at

00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:20,709
the same time I would shy from saying I

00:43:18,219 --> 00:43:22,209
have a commercial distribution of Tomcat

00:43:20,709 --> 00:43:25,239
and that is what I'm shipping to you

00:43:22,209 --> 00:43:32,349
because that is a problem from both a

00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:36,069
branding and a naming standpoint I was

00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:39,009
just going to pass it so I'll just I'll

00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:41,739
just you know maybe reiterate sort of

00:43:39,009 --> 00:43:44,679
the unusual business that you know may

00:43:41,739 --> 00:43:46,059
exist which have actually little to do

00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:47,319
with the existing Apache project and

00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:50,859
everything to do with the future Apache

00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:52,689
project what I found is that a lot of

00:43:50,859 --> 00:43:55,059
traditional enterprise companies these

00:43:52,689 --> 00:43:58,149
days they go through this phase you know

00:43:55,059 --> 00:44:00,849
like in popular literature being

00:43:58,149 --> 00:44:03,129
referred as digital transformation and

00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:05,439
as part of that it's actually you know

00:44:03,129 --> 00:44:08,409
on them to redefine themselves at least

00:44:05,439 --> 00:44:12,039
in you know a large part as software

00:44:08,409 --> 00:44:14,769
companies and they at some point all

00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:17,559
realize that part of that redefinition

00:44:14,769 --> 00:44:19,400
includes having two-way relationship

00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:21,490
with open source community

00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:24,380
and there's actually a great deal of

00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:27,109
what you're doing which is inner source

00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:29,900
essentially internally changing the

00:44:27,109 --> 00:44:32,119
culture legal climate just everything

00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:34,849
about the company to make them capable

00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:35,960
of that type of you know two-way streets

00:44:34,849 --> 00:44:40,640
relationship with open source

00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:43,220
communities ah it is a boutique business

00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:46,430
I would say but it is one that is

00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:48,259
extremely well paid so it's kind of like

00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:49,849
you know it's the bit that McKinsey

00:44:48,259 --> 00:44:58,549
cannot do for them let me put it this

00:44:49,849 --> 00:45:00,980
way yeah just small actually note I mean

00:44:58,549 --> 00:45:04,309
my company is like I already explained

00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:07,069
like the product we we we deliver which

00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:10,759
is also open source it's like 89 percent

00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:13,249
based on a bunch of software so what how

00:45:10,759 --> 00:45:16,999
we say it we really are standing on the

00:45:13,249 --> 00:45:21,499
shoulders of giants and we do add value

00:45:16,999 --> 00:45:24,410
in our own adaption of these projects

00:45:21,499 --> 00:45:27,019
and added features on top of that and we

00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:29,029
commercialize that so and then in our

00:45:27,019 --> 00:45:34,390
case we actually do this on a support

00:45:29,029 --> 00:45:38,900
subscription list but there's so much

00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:43,819
value in the Apache projects that anyone

00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:45,980
who cannot add value and make a product

00:45:43,819 --> 00:45:49,970
out of that he's not on the right track

00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:52,460
because you need smart people you need

00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:54,980
to have an edge you need to have

00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:58,160
something your competitors are not

00:45:54,980 --> 00:46:01,069
having or not looking at so you have a

00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:03,079
niche market but there's so much added

00:46:01,069 --> 00:46:07,249
value where you can leverage the Parsee

00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:09,980
software for this I see no reason why

00:46:07,249 --> 00:46:13,220
people can't build commercial business

00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:16,509
on top and actually it's like one of the

00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:16,509
best foundations you could start

00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:22,980
do we have any other Apache members in

00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:25,619
the room who want to have a quick

00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,980
comment on their business models willing

00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:27,980
to share

00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:36,330
no okay unfortunately we are out of time

00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:39,180
I see the next speaker hovering at the

00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:42,060
back of the room so thank you very much

00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:42,580
to our lovely panel and thank you all

00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:46,959
for coming

00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:46,959
