	The Apache Way for Business - Nick Burch, Apache Software Foundation

Wondering about how to best get involved in Apache projects or bring something new to the ASF? Struggling to understand how things work? Wishing you had a guide through all the mailing lists and online documentation? Figuring out how your business can engage with the projects that matter to it? Looking for just that one place you can turn to, to learn it all? Hunt no more!

Join a number of Apache old-hands for an interesting discussion on how businesses can engage with the ASF and its projects, what the "win" for those companies can be, and the odd (friendly!) tale of how not to do it...
