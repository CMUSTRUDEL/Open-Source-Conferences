Description: 
	Apache Way Panel: Software is Easy; People are Hard - Moderated by Benjamin Young, John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Community over code is a great mantra and certainly what we're aspiring to here. However, the devil lives in the details and the day-to-day of dealing with those pesky humans in the room is just plain hard.

This panel discussion will explore the years of shared experience (and inexperience!) from within the ASF. We'll discuss getting your community started, dealing with detractors, curating the code (good and bad), and sustaining interest and time from a globally diverse and distributed developer team.

thank you for coming to the software is

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:07,919
easy people are hard panel how many of

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,160
you believe that's true that software is

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,480
easy and people are hard all right

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,670
you've worked with people and maybe

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,680
software so there we go

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,080
these are our panelists introduce

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,340
everybody you get almost sat in the

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,390
right order that's amazing

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:26,519
not that you've seen these slides almost

00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:29,910
this is Steve Blackman of Apache streams

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,349
project which is Sharon foga they say

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,600
that right all right

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,880
Apache off is she does a lot on comdev

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,469
helped to attack one year when I was

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,059
there in the tummy men that was awesome

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:44,040
rich Bowen who you've probably seen a

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:46,200
lot of already he's famous exactly he

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,969
got the cake and Daniel grew know who's

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,559
mister infrastructure with all the other

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:52,320
mister infrastructures and missus

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,059
infrastructures yeah all right so that's

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,559
how that works these are our panelists

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,610
I'm Benjamin young I'm big blue hat on

00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,340
the Internet

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,820
I'm in apache couchdb and i'm incubating

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,379
a project this panel is important to me

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,299
i'm here to listen also i'm just going

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,369
to ask provocative questions and let

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,130
these people solve my problems and you

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:13,640
guys get to listen in I've been in

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,810
Apache for about six years and

00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,840
incubating is brand new to me so I have

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,909
new questions one of the questions that

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,520
Apache that gets asked a lot is who's in

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,990
charge when everybody is in charge right

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,390
everybody gets about how does this work

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,119
I mean just a quick overview of this and

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,920
then we've got the questions this is

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,310
kind of how I perceive what happened

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,560
sorry panelists and the stuffs behind

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,110
you the Apache way versus something

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,500
right the company or the be DFL or the

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,240
the Linux or whatever and these are the

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,490
words that are in my head like community

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,009
over code versus coercion volunteerism

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:53,220
versus command and control top-down

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,630
bottom-up stable unstable and an image

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,869
that helped me when I was getting into

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,610
Apache was this one about what it looks

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:03,180
like to be a leader versus a boss or a

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,770
manager the boss is on top right he's

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,049
just calling the shots and the people

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,879
are doing what he wants them to do and

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:10,560
then an Apache it's a little bit more

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,440
like the leader thing where you're just

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,080
one of the guys pulling something

00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:18,680
and people are following you because

00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:21,350
you're leading that's the idea so let's

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,140
get to these scenarios how do we survive

00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:27,410
in this environment right so scenario

00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,660
one I've got a github based project I'm

00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,940
the BD FL I really like my code this is

00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,980
my project and for whatever reason I've

00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,660
thought you know community over code is

00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,310
promising I get it I've been doing

00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:41,090
Apache con once these are cool people

00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:44,210
they know how to collaborate now I want

00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:47,420
to transition from just me to a bunch of

00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:50,980
other people what are your insights

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:53,630
panelists into how I give up my like

00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:56,900
dominance and share it with other people

00:02:53,630 --> 00:03:01,220
and do you have any experience in that

00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:03,790
personally go for it no you need a mic I

00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:08,090
think of a mic I have to do that thing

00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:10,730
so transitioning from a single dictator

00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:13,190
to sharing leadership with the community

00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,990
it can be difficult for reasons that

00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:17,570
aren't always immediately obvious

00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:20,900
because you know if you're determined to

00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:22,459
give up control the difficult part is

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,730
having other people accept that

00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:27,320
responsibility and and so you know if

00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:32,090
people continue to look to you for

00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:35,390
leadership you often have to refuse that

00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:37,610
you have to you have to actively give

00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,660
the keys to someone else and you know

00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:42,170
this can happen

00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:43,700
as easily as someone asks a question and

00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:47,090
everybody looks to you for the answer

00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:49,850
and you pass the mic to answer it thank

00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,489
you you refuse to answer the question on

00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,930
which you're the authority you say let's

00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:58,250
hear from someone else instead and you

00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:59,870
refuse to answer it but yeah that to me

00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,250
that's what I've observed is that that's

00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,850
the difficult part getting getting the

00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:06,380
community to actually step up to

00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:09,170
recognize that they're allowed to so you

00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:14,180
have to you have to very actively allow

00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:15,890
them to step up I think sort of

00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,720
following on from that it's that if

00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:20,000
you've decided that you want to

00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,940
transition the project then you're

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,700
actually thinking that hey I can't do it

00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,920
by myself I do need some help

00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,110
and you understand that there's going to

00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,530
be some sort of process of adjustment

00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,030
there's going to be something and you

00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,190
although you're the center of the

00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:40,250
knowledge it's going to be hard for you

00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,900
to say no to answering things you know

00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,270
people are coming to you anything right

00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:47,210
I do know the answer to that but maybe I

00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,980
need to just wait a bit to see whether

00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,230
or not somebody else can help out and

00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:54,260
that's the way you can sort of empower

00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,970
people to join the show that you're open

00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:01,330
to show that you're willing to accept

00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:01,330
and learn from other people as well I

00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:08,870
think this applies more generally to

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,410
being a leader manager of people will

00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:14,930
often look to you to kind of help them

00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:18,620
understand what they should work on and

00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:20,750
why so part of getting them to take over

00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,870
something is pointing them in the right

00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:26,000
direction encouraging them to try that

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,740
thing and to getting them good feedback

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,930
when they're when they're doing it well

00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,280
and then talking to them about what

00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:34,390
parts do you really want to be working

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,280
on not all of those discussions will

00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:39,380
happen in a public forum sometimes you

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,390
have to you know kind of get in the mix

00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:45,170
and develop a more personal relationship

00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:47,980
and understand someone's aspirations and

00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:49,970
technology or business or or whatever

00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,620
and kind of prod them in a direction

00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,570
that kind of makes sense

00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,350
and then if it's the right direction

00:05:53,570 --> 00:06:02,840
then they'll thrive Danyelle any

00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:05,660
thoughts on this on you sweet there's

00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:08,920
also the aspect of giving up the

00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:11,330
direction of the project if you're the

00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,910
leader of the project they'd be the only

00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:16,970
one coding you have in your mind a

00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:18,800
specific goal you want to set and when

00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:22,850
you give up the project you also have to

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,830
give up that goal because that is not

00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:28,580
what other people might see in your

00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:30,580
project and if you keep setting this is

00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,850
my goal this is the goal of the project

00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:37,770
then

00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:39,360
it's it it's it doesn't become a

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,990
community project it still just your

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,630
hobby project and it doesn't have the

00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:49,140
legitimacy of for gambling party project

00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:51,960
if it was personally I had like I had a

00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:54,510
project called Pony mail which was just

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,890
me for a while and then some other

00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:58,650
people came in and say hey we want to

00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:00,870
help and I was like that's great and the

00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:03,600
first two or three months was pretty

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,670
much well not in public but in private

00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,610
it was just infighting because we had

00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:10,530
different goals we all want the best for

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,350
the project but I had trouble giving up

00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:17,850
that this is not my project is a

00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:20,400
community project and I had to kind of

00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:24,380
just shut up at some point and let other

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,480
people get their say and get their way

00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,950
because otherwise I won't get any

00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,890
contributors and if I don't have

00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:36,690
contributors then the project is at some

00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:40,080
point going to die because I realize I'm

00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:42,390
not a maintainer we have two different

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,860
kinds of people maintaining our building

00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:46,320
code in Apache we have the maintainer

00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,050
and we have the entrepreneurs that the

00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,570
entrepreneurs start off the code and

00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:55,050
then at some point they burn out or they

00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:57,450
give up and then you if you don't have

00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:02,160
any maintainer 'he's the thought it just

00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:04,710
dies so the goal for me as an

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:10,020
entrepreneur is to at some point shut up

00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:12,000
and give the person all of them but give

00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,650
me their good goal definition of goals

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,200
who the maintainer because they're the

00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:19,530
ones that are going to maintain it for

00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,840
now and forever and not me so even

00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:25,350
though I love for example Pony mail and

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,180
I can't be the one that decides this is

00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:30,840
what's going to happen in five years

00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:33,690
because I probably won't be well I will

00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,380
be developing but I'm if I lead it I'll

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:41,219
burn out and then the project will die

00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:42,789
so sorry and at a very early stage you

00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:44,949
just have to

00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,839
not give up the project but you have to

00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:49,000
give up the Rings and you have to shut

00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:52,420
up for a while and let other people

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,680
figure out what what do I think about it

00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:58,540
and what do they think about it and I

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,720
have no idea where I'm going with this

00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,639
I'll just have a mic over as a the next

00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,170
scenario may help you out or one of them

00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:06,940
will for sure

00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,050
so what do you do when you've done this

00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,970
and you're starting to show your

00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:12,550
leadership and everyone else is wrong

00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,680
like we've got this going this is my

00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:17,350
baby and I'm sharing it now and I'm okay

00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,959
and I'm trying to share it I want I want

00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:22,329
to do that but everyone's just wrong

00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:24,670
right like they don't understand why

00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:28,089
we're here how do you how do you do that

00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:29,529
how do you like grapple with that and

00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:34,300
you don't want to be that person in the

00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:36,370
project right well you can probably want

00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,290
to start by recognizing that they might

00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:42,490
not all be wrong that you might be the

00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:44,079
one who's wrong okay you're standing in

00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,910
a corner all by yourself it might be

00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:47,860
because you're not thinking through it

00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:51,579
the same way that they are and they're

00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:53,740
even if they're newer their take on what

00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:57,930
the project can and you know can and

00:09:53,740 --> 00:10:01,089
should be is just as valid as your own

00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:05,069
yeah I think that's an interesting

00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:08,110
comment as well it's I think it's about

00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:12,519
being able to see that other people's

00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:13,870
opinions are as valid as yours by saying

00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:15,670
that you know everybody else is wrong

00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,769
it's effectively you're discounting a

00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:21,490
buddy else's opinion I mean yes you may

00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:24,610
be may have something but if you can't

00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:29,680
portray or communicate that value that

00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:31,839
you can add to other people then you

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,690
might as well you know you're you're by

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,190
yourself you're there because you want

00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:39,250
to be part of the community you want to

00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:41,949
work alongside other people it's not

00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,649
about one person it's about the

00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:46,959
community so it's about understanding

00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:49,750
and respecting other people's opinions

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,769
too so maybe look if people are telling

00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:56,259
you that you were wrong okay yeah maybe

00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:58,389
where am i wrong what do you see why do

00:10:56,259 --> 00:11:01,329
you think I'm wrong ask questions about

00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:04,479
it rather than making a you know our

00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:07,689
basic on I'm right on that and there are

00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:11,079
so asked questions kind of asked and why

00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:13,629
people think that you're wrong and get

00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:16,059
to the bottom of it and I think once

00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:18,189
that dialogue is created then you've got

00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:19,749
some common ground to find out okay

00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:22,419
maybe I need to think about something

00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:24,220
but difficulty maybe the other people

00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:25,959
once you they started you answered

00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,600
questions for them I think actually

00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:30,100
maybe you know hey there is a bit of

00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,989
merit here there's a bit of something

00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:35,369
interesting here but maybe you just

00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:35,369
didn't communicate at the correct one

00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:42,220
there's a number of scenarios in my

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:46,209
various worlds right now that overlap

00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:48,759
around this particular question so I

00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:50,559
work for a company that has grown from

00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:51,999
four thousand people to eleven thousand

00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,999
people in the last four years which

00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:57,999
means that the old people are in the

00:11:54,999 --> 00:12:00,359
minority right so who's who's right I

00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:03,039
work for the Apache Software Foundation

00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:06,129
where we've grown from one project to

00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:08,649
200 projects in the last 20 years and so

00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:11,889
those of us that were there the first

00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:14,470
year are no longer in the majority so

00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:16,629
who's right and they're there comes a

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,459
point and this there's an internal

00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:20,230
discussion at Apache that's going on

00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:23,410
right now around the question of what

00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:26,230
our core values who gets to decide what

00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:28,929
are the core values is it the the people

00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:30,939
with gray in their beards or is it the

00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:33,100
majority who care passionately about

00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:36,970
this thing and this is the conversation

00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:39,159
that will happen always in any group of

00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:41,769
people that grows beyond the original

00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:44,129
founders so you have the choice to keep

00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:48,249
it just us in our little social club or

00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:52,569
open it up to the entire world and allow

00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:55,679
them to mold the direction but you do

00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:59,259
need to determine what are your core

00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:02,649
non-negotiable values and and stick to

00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:05,350
them so you know if I were to pick a

00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:08,859
software project the core values of the

00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,939
Apache HTTP server are that we adhere to

00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:11,799
the HTTP

00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:16,479
classification that's not something

00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:18,099
we're ever going to negotiate away the

00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:21,099
core values of the Apache Software

00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:23,949
Foundation well that's a little bit more

00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:26,289
difficult to pin down but it's something

00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:29,379
that you need to determine and document

00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:31,749
and stick to and and be willing for that

00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:35,529
to be the hell to die on not what color

00:13:31,749 --> 00:13:37,269
you paint the bike shed and I'm going to

00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:40,209
go in to complete the opposite direction

00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:42,459
and say if if you don't want to be that

00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:45,489
person you should lay on your back be

00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:48,759
completely defenseless and say I am

00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:51,759
actually wrong let the others be right

00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:54,399
for a change because in a in a systemic

00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,929
context everyone you talk to even though

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,449
you disagree with them they're right and

00:13:55,929 --> 00:14:03,059
they have a reason to be right you might

00:13:58,449 --> 00:14:05,229
not know it but in their little bubble

00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:07,299
they are right when they say they're

00:14:05,229 --> 00:14:09,729
right it's because they have reason to

00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:11,139
believe that they are right and you

00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:12,459
probably also have reason to believe

00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:14,559
you're right but you're being

00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:18,069
defenseless or so you're being defensive

00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:20,739
because it's your project so the the

00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:23,559
goal of for you if you don't want to be

00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:26,379
that person is to stop being so

00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:29,229
defensive about your project and it's

00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:30,939
it's really easy to become defensive of

00:14:29,229 --> 00:14:33,249
your project when when you build it from

00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:35,889
scratch and someone comes over says well

00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:39,489
that doesn't work or that is technically

00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:42,369
wrong but in your mind because you made

00:14:39,489 --> 00:14:46,899
all this you know exactly why it's it's

00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:49,869
right not wrong you just can't explain

00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:54,639
it because there is you actually you are

00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:57,220
wrong but and the way you imagine the

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,709
project in your head everything is fun

00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,479
and if someone come to criticize it it's

00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:02,919
not the project it's not the software

00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:06,519
they're criticizing it suddenly you

00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:11,829
they're criticizing or so you think so

00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:14,559
you got a just lay on your back belly-up

00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:16,749
and say I'm sorry you are right I am

00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:19,479
wrong if you can't do that then you

00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:22,600
can't grow a community because it'll be

00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:23,769
your project and you will be the not

00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,029
even that beneficial

00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:27,459
later for life you'll just be the

00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:31,480
dictator if you can't lower your

00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:32,920
defenses and that took me personally a

00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:37,269
while to do

00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:40,899
I hope I'm there now we still have some

00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:43,299
infighting but it's it's getting better

00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:46,439
we're getting four in my project we were

00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:48,999
getting more contributors because I am

00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:51,489
kind of saying I don't want to deal with

00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:53,679
it you deal with it and then they

00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:55,269
eventually the new people will deal with

00:15:53,679 --> 00:16:00,309
it because they do have an itch to

00:15:55,269 --> 00:16:03,100
scratch so they look to me first and if

00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:07,769
I just shut up then eventually they will

00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:13,269
actually do it and have so I've learned

00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:16,649
so sit back lower your defenses say the

00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:19,749
word sorry I'm wrong or I might be wrong

00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:22,779
and that will that will also give them

00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:25,299
confidence to contribute more because

00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:28,959
hey I got an idea and it didn't get shut

00:16:25,299 --> 00:16:31,749
down first second I said it so maybe I

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:34,299
right maybe I can contribute maybe I'm

00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:42,220
actually good at this it will give them

00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:43,240
a boost yeah but for calm like a social

00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,220
sharing thing they have these great

00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,959
articles on collaboration because

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:50,079
they're all remote and they talk about a

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:52,689
no ego doer which is like somebody who's

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,959
not basically what you described not

00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:57,089
super self defensive but out there doing

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,839
contributing in some way this

00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:01,240
combination of things and I liked how

00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:03,579
like solid you said like you just got to

00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,110
do this and then there's room for other

00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:07,380
people to have an opinion all right

00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:10,240
let's see what's next great thoughts all

00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,220
alright dealing with that person so it's

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,699
not you you've you've taken Daniels

00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,750
advice and it's great advice but now

00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:19,990
there's this other person that's shown

00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:21,789
up and and they are an ego nandu or

00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,669
perhaps and they're just throwing mud in

00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:27,039
your issue tracker and and being that

00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:29,200
person how do you do how do you deal

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,789
with them I mean there's no really like

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,710
maybe they have committed already right

00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:35,750
you can't just like punt them out yeah I

00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:37,940
have a good tool that's called whisky

00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:42,440
oh he can just go on the next slide then

00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:44,450
right yeah it's super difficult to enter

00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,770
that because you you really you have to

00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:52,730
well first of all you have to have

00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:54,770
patience and you have to have a I mean

00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,690
code of conduct and all that place aside

00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:58,850
you have to have a place to vent also

00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:02,419
and and it shouldn't be the public

00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:04,370
mailing list for God's sake its Apaches

00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:07,370
it's open its open development it's over

00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:09,200
discussions but you're allowed to have a

00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:12,039
small group or you say oh my god I

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,900
really hate this person and you should

00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:16,760
because if you don't then privately

00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,650
you're going to vent topically at some

00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,000
point and that's not going to just

00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:22,460
affect you it's going to affect the

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,900
entire project it's going to some

00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:27,530
journalist is going to Lube it up and

00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:30,770
say hey this party's in trouble and then

00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:34,820
you won't get contributors and then it

00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:40,250
goes downhill so find a place to then

00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:43,669
find some scotch and because you can you

00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:45,740
can be a what I want to call a legal

00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:49,250
jerk you can be you can do something

00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:52,220
that is allowed but it's not cool but I

00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:54,110
can't kick you out like it's okay for me

00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,850
to yell at my neighbor it's not cool

00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:58,220
that I do it it's not but it's not

00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:01,039
illegal so I could do it and we couldn't

00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:03,580
do anything about it so that there will

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:07,940
be situations in which we have no tools

00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:11,200
for dealing with people that are just in

00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:14,030
the right above the line they are not

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,570
people you can throw out but there are

00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:20,419
also people you don't like so find out

00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:23,120
find a place to vent privately get some

00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:25,610
scotch and if they if they break the

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,500
code of conduct it's quite important to

00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:31,429
have a code of conduct and we have that

00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:34,429
at a pass you know thanks to John us two

00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:38,390
years ago we actually just we just did

00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:40,010
it we added a code of conduct but but it

00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:44,830
doesn't cover everything and I have

00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:44,830
personally no way of dealing with

00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:51,440
see there's a name I want to say but I'm

00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:53,659
not going to say it but you yeah the

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,039
panelists know when talking about that

00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:58,610
kind of person

00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:00,230
I have no no question Oh way to deal

00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:02,000
with the person I have a boy to deal

00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:06,139
with myself and my feelings for that

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,899
person so I'm gonna pass the mic on to

00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:11,360
someone who probably also has no idea

00:20:08,899 --> 00:20:13,909
but there's so many people you could

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,240
have meant and there's not enough Scotch

00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:18,980
there really how I go okay there's a you

00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,490
know something that we say at Apache is

00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:25,809
that community is community over code

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:30,440
community is more valuable than code um

00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:32,480
and so I mean this is a very it's a very

00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,830
difficult question because there's so

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,240
many difference in areas in which this

00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,070
might apply because some people are

00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,440
actively destructive to the community

00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:42,380
and other people are just folks that you

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,210
disagree with for reasons of ego or for

00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:48,769
reasons of technical direction or

00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:52,669
whatever so there is a there's a

00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:54,380
presentation that was given by one of

00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:57,019
our one of our members it's called

00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:59,480
dealing with poisonous people it's it's

00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:02,360
worth while watching I don't agree with

00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:05,600
everything that fit says in that but it

00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:07,429
it's important to consider before it

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,510
happens what you're going to do to

00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:15,799
poison do to do to people do about

00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:17,120
poisonous people in your community as

00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:18,889
Daniel says we have a code of conduct

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:23,210
but what's lacking from the code of

00:21:18,889 --> 00:21:25,370
conduct is the or else the enforcement

00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:28,399
aspect of it if somebody breaks the code

00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:31,010
of conduct then what and that's a very

00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:32,750
important thing to consider before it

00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:39,769
happens rather than trying to figure it

00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:45,769
out once it's happened my view is fully

00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:48,080
around looking at separating the person

00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:50,480
from the behavior so is it the person

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,279
that you don't like or don't get on with

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,320
or is it the behavior that they're

00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:57,320
exhibiting within the community

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,360
so you might have the case where you get

00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,620
it on with somebody quite socially but

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,720
on the mailing list

00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:05,990
they're quite disruptive so they're

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,310
better there's a separation now you see

00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:14,030
this is why I think it's a bit

00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:16,280
complicated so people are hard yeah so I

00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:19,250
mean if it's a behavior I mean people

00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:22,100
are adults as well and have the ability

00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:24,140
to modify or change their behavior maybe

00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,720
from a cultural perspective they don't

00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:29,750
realize that it is an act and actually

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,690
aggressive or negative or whatever

00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:34,660
behavior and it may be that it's part of

00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:40,220
their culture to be maybe abrupt order

00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:41,810
whatever so one way that you can deal

00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,160
with it is to have a private

00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,920
conversation with the person to

00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:48,860
understand to see whether or not they

00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,180
realize that they're causing disruption

00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:54,260
in the community because they might not

00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:57,170
realize it yeah and this is something

00:22:54,260 --> 00:23:00,610
that you can attempt I think and to see

00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:03,410
whether or not that the person can be

00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:06,350
given the feedback that they are causing

00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:09,380
some disruption and if they can adjust

00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:12,170
that behavior that's fine if they don't

00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:14,810
believe they're they're wrong or that

00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:16,940
the exceptional then yes it's going to

00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:18,950
be quite difficult and I think I agree

00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,200
when you say well with the code of

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:23,360
conduct there isn't an or else piece

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,550
there you can work through it and you've

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:29,810
got somebody in the community and you

00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:32,680
just have to be patient and you also

00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:36,950
have to be not drawn not not to be

00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:38,720
pulled into an emotional sort of battle

00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:41,420
because that's what it becomes it can

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,850
escalate into like a a war and a battle

00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,410
so once you get into that stage then

00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:47,900
it's like you know it can be really

00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,550
really negative and destructive so first

00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,320
of all try and approach the person try

00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:53,450
and understand the behavior and if that

00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:58,790
doesn't work then yes you just need to

00:23:53,450 --> 00:24:00,080
be mature about it really just real

00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:03,380
quickly I want to appeal to a higher

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:06,140
authority so I'll quote scripture at you

00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,640
if your brother offends you approach him

00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,460
privately

00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:13,640
and so I'm quoting from misquoting from

00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:16,400
the letters of Paul in the Bible and he

00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,990
says if your brother offends you go talk

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,080
to him privately and that usually works

00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:23,440
and if it doesn't take two or three of

00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,700
your friends and talk to them again and

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,190
that usually works and if it doesn't

00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:31,640
then call this person out in front of

00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:36,850
the entire community and if that doesn't

00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,850
work then throw them out so there you go

00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:44,960
I don't have any specific experience

00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:46,250
with a community Salvatore I guess to

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,940
kind of what we've been talking about

00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:52,880
here but to the theme of giving up

00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,830
control right I'll note that people that

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,400
are coming into your project are

00:24:54,830 --> 00:25:02,240
bringing their own mindset and

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:04,160
experience and preferences and they're

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,490
going to often find fault with how

00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:09,860
things currently are and you know the

00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:13,160
proper response I think in those

00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:15,169
situations is a I'm really glad that

00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,610
you're interested in this I'm really

00:25:15,169 --> 00:25:19,100
happy to you know to have you here

00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:20,210
trying to make things better yes that

00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,100
thing that you said isn't good enough

00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:23,690
you're right it's not good enough right

00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,900
how about we talk about how to make it

00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:29,270
better and then you know as a as a

00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,460
person with a vote as to whether

00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:34,400
something gets accepted or not just be

00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:36,140
very explicit about your the criteria

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,570
that I have for whatever we would

00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:40,250
replace it with right here's the current

00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,200
thing does these things the new things

00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:45,470
should do those things too as well or

00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,600
better and then if that person wants to

00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:49,760
take the lead and making a larger change

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,250
you should be supportive of that 100%

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:58,340
even if it means swapping out the

00:25:52,250 --> 00:26:00,830
familiar for the unfamiliar hanging just

00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:03,080
want to say two things to this the first

00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:07,400
one is I'm going to quote the better of

00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:11,299
Rich Bowen that varies much honoring the

00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:13,610
email not sent if if you have one of

00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:15,890
those people on the mailing list that

00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:20,210
just works you and you have a really

00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:21,410
really long rant about him or her step

00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:23,240
away

00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:26,990
save it as a draft look at it the the

00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:31,010
next day and then hopefully you'll just

00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:33,020
delete it because we escalate especially

00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:35,780
at a party else because we were we are

00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:38,660
so committed to a party that things

00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:41,150
escalate very very quickly because we

00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:43,460
both believe that this is not the core

00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:46,580
value of a patio this is the core value

00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:49,040
of a path you or this is definitely a

00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:51,620
technical decision and you might say

00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,330
it's not and because we're both so

00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:57,040
committed to the project it escalates

00:26:53,330 --> 00:27:00,200
very quickly so always take a step back

00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:02,450
look at your email save it but don't

00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:06,860
send it and then look at it later when

00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:09,830
you cool down and that really helps a

00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:13,910
lot or just delete the email that works

00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:18,470
you and also the boards named Jenna

00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:20,630
likens yeah she does a great talk about

00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:26,230
something called disco no it's kind of

00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:29,720
like DEFCON but for escalating or

00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:31,100
escalations in in in the way that people

00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:36,290
talk to each other on the mailing list

00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:38,690
or in in real life and about how you can

00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:42,470
analyze and find out what sort of level

00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:46,130
are we on are we on DEFCON 1 or 2 or 3

00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:50,120
or 4 and depending on what level you're

00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:54,980
on how do we disengage and go to a lower

00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:58,670
level how do we make people relax it's I

00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:01,070
think it's on YouTube somewhere he's

00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:05,300
done it aloud so you should go check

00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:07,010
that out awesome thank you all and in

00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,480
case you're not noticing a lot of this

00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:12,890
is applicable outside of the Apache

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:15,440
foundation have it have a sent mail or a

00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:17,660
draft thing full of all your angst email

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,570
and you should go really to engage ready

00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:24,410
yeah really it's cathartic if nothing

00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:26,900
else right all right next up no one else

00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:28,640
cares so I'm here I'm working on this

00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,050
project and maybe there were other

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,500
people at one point and everybody was

00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:35,890
excited and then they left the room

00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:37,390
you know digitally and now I'm trying to

00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:39,520
get more people in or maybe it's my

00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,170
incubating project and I'm looking at

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,520
you Steve and you've been banging and

00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:44,170
banging and bang and it's saying and

00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,650
nobody's showing up and come on please

00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:46,750
please

00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:49,020
I've been six months in an incubator

00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:51,160
project trying to drag people in so

00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:54,010
would you do that how do you incentivize

00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:56,800
volunteerism how do you get people to

00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:58,900
care either as much as you do or ideally

00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:07,360
to Daniel's earlier stuff more than you

00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:11,050
do well I have the mic so sometimes you

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:13,510
have to well so Daniel already already

00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:16,900
gave a concrete example of this you step

00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:20,050
back and you see what happens and and

00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,700
when you do that you might somewhere in

00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:24,400
your mind have to be willing to accept

00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:26,350
the fact that nobody does care that this

00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:31,180
is a project that only matters to you

00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:33,040
and you know that's okay but some

00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:37,180
projects don't don't become what you

00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:39,190
wish them to be but very frequently when

00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:43,150
you step back from something and it

00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:45,610
starts to to fall into disrepair the

00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:49,090
people that do rely on it step up and

00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:51,910
make it happen and this organization is

00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:54,610
a result of just such a situation there

00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:57,460
was a web server project it's called the

00:29:54,610 --> 00:30:00,970
NCSA web server the person that worked

00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:04,600
on it got a job and quit working on it

00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:07,720
and it laid abandoned for six months and

00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,850
then some people that realize that it

00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:14,010
was abandoned stepped up and started

00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:14,010
working on it and here we are today

00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:24,400
okay I'll say something and I think when

00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:26,380
you when you look at projects I mean we

00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,120
have the the various mailing lists so we

00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,909
have the the Deadman mailing list we

00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,289
have the user mailing list and a lot of

00:30:29,909 --> 00:30:34,059
activity around the project tends to

00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:37,090
happen around on the dead list because

00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:39,340
it's you know creating releases etc so I

00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:43,480
would say you know look at the user list

00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:46,690
I mean maybe I'm linking into but that's

00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:49,149
needed um look at the user list because

00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,980
the your user base your your project is

00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:53,799
creating something people are

00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:57,779
downloading and using that you know it's

00:30:53,799 --> 00:31:01,000
a those are the people that maybe maybe

00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:02,770
what they will be interested in doing

00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,260
something in contributing because

00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:07,120
they're using it already they're already

00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:10,299
customers that already clients and if

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,980
there is the possibility that hey you

00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:13,899
know that we're no longer going to be

00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:16,120
able to have this and I'm no longer be

00:31:13,899 --> 00:31:18,190
able to maintain this or I'll do this

00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:20,350
and actually well we're getting value

00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:22,840
out of it maybe it's time for us to step

00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:25,690
up and do something so I would say might

00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:27,970
be sort of reach out and look at the the

00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:31,270
user base because that is I think of

00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:33,820
really what a wide net where you can

00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:36,490
capture potential people that would be

00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:41,590
interested in doing something for your

00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:43,450
project so the reality is and a lot of

00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:44,799
in a lot of circumstances just because

00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:49,029
you build it doesn't mean they're going

00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:52,960
to come right and so what I've learned

00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:54,940
is that you have to be you have to be a

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,120
recruiter like you have to identify the

00:31:54,940 --> 00:32:00,669
people that you think will be interested

00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:02,340
you have to reach out to them and you

00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:04,899
have to sell you got to convince them

00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:07,690
here's why this is exciting

00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:10,120
here's why it's important here's where

00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:15,309
it's going here's how you specifically

00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:17,620
can come make it better and fortunately

00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:20,679
you know there's a there's an imprimatur

00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:22,779
to being associated with apache I think

00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:24,899
we those of us who are in it deeply

00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:27,490
don't you know think about that as much

00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:28,929
but that can be a strong motivating

00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,510
factor to people who aren't part of

00:32:28,929 --> 00:32:32,000
Apache

00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:33,230
here's a chance for you know you know

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,600
work with people who have a lot of

00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:38,630
experience and software and an

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:41,210
open-source and you know my team is

00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:44,030
looking for people like you to come in

00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:48,770
and be a part of it so don't be afraid

00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:51,710
to sell all the valuable learnings and

00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:53,510
you know career credentials that that

00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:57,500
are that can be potentially achieved if

00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:58,730
they do a good job and work hard and you

00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:02,740
have to understand what those

00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:02,740
individuals are motivated by and

00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,030
encourage them to participate in a way

00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:11,150
that is going to be both interesting to

00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:14,440
them and fulfilling for them over the

00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:14,440
longer term if things go well

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,030
another comment I want to make because I

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,490
was at a conference and somebody came up

00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:24,380
to me and they said hey one of the

00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:27,260
things that I really admire about Apache

00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:30,890
is that you have the Attic in the sense

00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:33,500
that if it's time for a retired project

00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:36,320
that there is a place where the code

00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:38,630
goes all the information goes and if

00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,660
somebody at a later date wanted to pick

00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:43,040
that up they can do and that was an

00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:45,140
amazing thing

00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,690
like you know hey somebody somebody's

00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:49,549
happy that we've got the Attic and it

00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:53,630
seems a bit strange but you know

00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:55,730
listening it's it's part of what Apache

00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:57,770
is it's part of you know there's a cycle

00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:59,690
of projects not everything is going to

00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:01,669
last forever we want things to last

00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:04,760
forever we build an environment for

00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:06,410
things to try and endure but some of the

00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,090
projects are not going to make it so

00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:10,520
let's make sure you know we've got a

00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:12,320
place for that and we've got we put in a

00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,409
provision so if anybody wants to come

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:20,929
along in the future pick that up and get

00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:24,169
it moving again then they can do one

00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:27,940
other comment oh and there's a Henry had

00:34:24,169 --> 00:34:27,940
a comment about the the Attic I guess

00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:43,150
thank you so I wanted to share was

00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:45,420
there's a study recently around

00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:47,860
socialness and what makes you successful

00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:49,560
being social and as an introvert it

00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:52,420
likes to hide at the back of the room

00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:54,370
kind of reading this and it's that there

00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:57,280
were two things one was be where the

00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:59,050
traffic is so if you're at a bar as if

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,240
you had a party when it be social be by

00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:03,580
the keg be by the drinks don't be in a

00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,560
corner and the second one was listen

00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:07,120
don't be a dumb be a talker who's

00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,070
telling everyone everything and pushing

00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,810
his opinion out be someone who's

00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:13,630
listening and I think this actually

00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:15,070
works really well in this case is as an

00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:17,800
open-source project we tend to make the

00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:19,480
project and we think the place where the

00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,220
conversation should be is with us on the

00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:24,100
project but that's not what your traffic

00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:25,510
is your traffic is not yet with you so

00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,830
when you've got to use a list your

00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:28,450
traffic starts being a user list but

00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:30,640
before then where were your potential

00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:32,440
contributors they're not even with you

00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,000
yet so you got to get on Twitter you got

00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,100
to go to conferences you've got to tell

00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,170
people about what the thing is you've

00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,880
got but I want to argue a little on the

00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,590
selling side is I think you don't need

00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,330
to sell I think you to ask people what

00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:45,610
do they want to do with it and they need

00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:47,110
to sit and listen because that turns

00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,910
them into an owner and a member of your

00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:51,400
project rather than into a customer and

00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:57,490
so there's my two ones like traffic and

00:35:51,400 --> 00:36:01,480
listening so the other thing I wanted to

00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:03,790
say is that you need to preach the

00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:07,900
message that software projects are not

00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:12,340
just source code that other places where

00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:14,800
people can contribute are not that

00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:17,430
aren't there at least as important as

00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,510
the source code and often more important

00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:23,380
encouraging people to contribute to

00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:25,450
documentation is often the the Gateway

00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,860
to them eventually contributing to the

00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:29,200
source code but maybe they'll just

00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:31,480
contribute to documentation and that's

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:35,560
that's what I do that's what I've always

00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:37,570
done it Apache marketing helping you get

00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,910
the message out that's something that

00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:43,090
people can contribute to without the

00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:45,730
degree in computer science design is

00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:48,910
something that every single project at

00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:51,640
Apache desperately needs it's if you

00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:52,900
know how to design anything from a on

00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,950
screen widget

00:36:52,900 --> 00:37:00,100
to a website to stickers to physical

00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:04,540
goods every Apache project desperately

00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:07,660
needs your help and so again just just a

00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:13,960
message that source code is only a

00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:16,770
fraction of a software project my answer

00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:21,040
here would be fake internet points and

00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:22,480
by that I mean the usually when you have

00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,300
a project and it's not going that well

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,120
you think oh I've got no users you're

00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,900
just not looking in the right place

00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,330
you're not looking where the

00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:33,010
contributors are because again they

00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:34,840
don't have you don't have fake internet

00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:37,480
points to give out if you go to a place

00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:41,710
like Stack Overflow this is I'm stealing

00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:43,570
religious thoughts here we have we

00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:45,970
always have issues on the way apache web

00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:47,740
server with people not showing up to

00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:50,230
write documentation or helping out

00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:51,370
answering questions and we're like well

00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:53,350
where are they

00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:56,500
why don't anyone care about the

00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:59,040
documentation they do there are

00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:01,600
thousands of people out there there are

00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,300
bursting to come and help us with

00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,370
documentation they just don't know where

00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,350
to go so they go to stack overflow and

00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:10,870
they get their fake internet points and

00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:12,220
they answer sometimes they give the

00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:14,370
wrong answer sometimes they give the

00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:17,220
right answer but they want to help and

00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:20,740
we just suck at finding them and

00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:22,840
bringing them back in so we that the

00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:25,090
thought I had this one was at Apache we

00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:28,660
should kind of get some sort of fake

00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:31,150
several points or whatever karma that is

00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:32,770
in your cat that is cross community so

00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:36,010
we could track how well people

00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:37,420
contribute to Apache projects and then

00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:40,350
maybe make them commit or if they get

00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:43,180
thousand points or something like that

00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:46,990
because it kind of matters to people

00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:49,870
that they have a status s I am helping

00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:53,710
out blend and they might not be a

00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:57,040
committer yet but it's even though it's

00:38:53,710 --> 00:39:00,610
fake it's real and I really think that

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,460
we should sort of spin in a way do that

00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:05,880
at Apache

00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:07,500
and in the individual projects to give

00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:11,099
some recognition that isn't just

00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:13,470
committal ship but is something that

00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:15,930
everyone can have without having to

00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:20,450
spend days on end

00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:22,740
committing patches to to the project

00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:24,720
great idea and then we kind of like

00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:27,569
opiate addicts like the fedora badges

00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,180
program yeah that would be cool yeah

00:39:27,569 --> 00:39:33,390
awesome we have one more scenario and

00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:36,569
then a final call to action and then a

00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:39,270
question so this is our last scenario

00:39:36,569 --> 00:39:40,890
I'm trapped in my own project I've been

00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:43,230
doing this forever how do I get out

00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:44,760
Daniel gets the mic immediately how do I

00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:46,109
get out like I'm done I've got other

00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,579
things I want to work on maybe it's

00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:52,619
another Apache project I just want to

00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:55,050
say whiskey again is how I get by I I

00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:59,190
don't I I have this scenario in my head

00:39:55,050 --> 00:40:01,530
for a few projects and I have no answer

00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:04,410
actually so I'm going to give the

00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:07,440
microwave and please help you want the

00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:10,619
answer is that yeah if anyone wants to

00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,970
help produce the next Apache con I'm in

00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:16,380
this scenario and no seriously um I

00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:17,549
think that this is closer related to

00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:21,510
some of the other questions that have

00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:24,630
been asked and you know you just you you

00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:27,809
just have to step back give other people

00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:29,250
permission and allow them to make you

00:40:27,809 --> 00:40:33,030
know what you would call mistakes

00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:35,690
without correcting them and I've seen

00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:39,450
Daniel do this on the pony mail project

00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:41,069
I've seen brian behlendorf and Roy

00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:44,160
fielding do that on the Apache web

00:40:41,069 --> 00:40:45,990
server project and you can tell that

00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,059
they're just itching to tell you you're

00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:50,849
wrong but they they have the

00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:53,010
self-control not to and that's

00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:56,040
incredibly difficult when you know

00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:58,049
you're right and you know Sarah but so

00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:02,309
it's closer related to the former

00:40:58,049 --> 00:41:04,950
question yeah I think it's a it's a hard

00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:06,839
scenario because I think as projects

00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:10,049
sort of develop you get people that are

00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:12,510
seen as the experts in particular areas

00:41:10,049 --> 00:41:14,250
and so the rest of the communities are

00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:16,049
right okay if it's ten anything to do

00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,710
documentation our contact which if it's

00:41:16,049 --> 00:41:19,530
anything to do with

00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:24,300
our contact Lee so you've already got a

00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:26,930
reputation as being the person to go to

00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:29,550
and also that knowledge expert so if

00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:31,920
anything comes out the round at your

00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:32,369
specialization people expect you to step

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,290
in

00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:36,300
they're waiting for you to step in and

00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:38,099
you know when you're when you don't step

00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:42,480
in there's a hey did you not see that

00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:45,270
first hey did you not do that and yeah I

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,760
did see it but I was I think it's time

00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:52,800
for somebody else you know so it's it's

00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:55,710
hard um and I think that the the dilemma

00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:59,010
is that you you think that the project

00:41:55,710 --> 00:42:00,750
might suffer a little and because you're

00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:02,700
committed to your project you don't want

00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:04,319
the project to suffer you don't want a

00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,640
community to suffer and so it's you're

00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:09,390
in between a rock and a hard place

00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:11,910
really but you need to make the

00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:14,400
community develop on its own the

00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:17,670
communities of living entity it's a

00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:20,369
thing that that grows and it needs to

00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:23,010
evolve and you're not going to be there

00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:25,020
all the time you know not you don't will

00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:29,250
be there forever so that you know that

00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:33,059
the natural cycle is that somebody or or

00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:35,490
some people need to take over that to be

00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:39,390
able to develop into the next generation

00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:40,980
you could call it as well so yeah it

00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:43,770
sounds like the earlier you start the

00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:45,869
happier you'll be later there's actually

00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:48,359
kind of a counterintuitive thing about

00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:51,720
community that the more that you as a

00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:54,569
founder of a community help the less of

00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:57,119
a community you have so you got to do

00:42:54,569 --> 00:42:59,460
the the right thing which is the wrong

00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,559
thing in your head is don't don't

00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:05,130
develop a project because the more that

00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:08,040
we develop as a founder as a sole

00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:09,780
programmer the more I help the less the

00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,339
community will grow because there is no

00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:14,369
need for community to grow because I'm

00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:16,290
doing all the stuff still so why do why

00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:19,260
do blogs witness which need to commit

00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:23,849
Apache if I'm doing all the work so you

00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:25,859
need to do the thing and not develop

00:43:23,849 --> 00:43:28,829
your project if you want to develop the

00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:29,700
community and then the community will

00:43:28,829 --> 00:43:32,160
hope

00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:33,990
we make some code or documentation or

00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,660
whatever but it seems counterintuitive

00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:42,360
to that you gotta do the thing that you

00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:44,520
really don't want to do one of the

00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:49,230
founders of the apache community

00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:52,170
Stefano Mizuki wrote an amazing document

00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:54,900
15 years in Athens 15 years ago now

00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:57,270
where he says the best way to develop a

00:43:54,900 --> 00:44:00,180
vibrant community in software a software

00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:03,600
community is to have an input an

00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:06,570
imperfect idea and terrible code because

00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:08,580
if you have a complete idea of what the

00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:10,230
final product has to be and you've

00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:13,350
written all the code what is there for

00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:16,440
anyone else to do and so yeah I

00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:18,120
recommend finding his original blog post

00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:22,830
because it says it a lot better than I

00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:25,410
did I don't know if it's just me but it

00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:29,990
seems like this problem is way worse

00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:29,990
than my day job than it is Apache

00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:37,290
you know I think the answer though is

00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:38,790
kind of similar like if if you're on the

00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:40,740
hook to do something and it needs to get

00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:44,040
done and you feel you need to devote

00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:47,100
your energies elsewhere the only way

00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:51,150
you're getting across that transition is

00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:54,450
to identify and encourage and in train a

00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:56,400
replacement and as it happens you know

00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:58,230
it's great if there's a horde of people

00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,930
on your list like looking for something

00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:03,120
to do well then it's been a long time

00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:05,460
since I worked for a company where we

00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:10,590
had people sitting around not busy that

00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:15,390
I could just motivate with by telling

00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:17,250
them it was their job but the difference

00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:19,680
in the volunteer side is you have to

00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:21,960
actually motivate them to think that

00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,690
it's important to step up and do that

00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,540
it's not enough to like it might be a

00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:30,330
job to just tell them it's their job

00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:32,700
yeah cool okay one last thing a last

00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:34,110
piece of advice to achieve community

00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,790
over code is there anything that we

00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:37,410
haven't covered that you can tell

00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:39,270
somebody you're trying to build a

00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:41,010
community it's more important to you

00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:42,280
because you've listened really well for

00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:45,250
the last 40 minutes

00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:48,270
then your code is what would each of you

00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:57,850
say do this and you'll be fine

00:45:48,270 --> 00:46:01,540
ish I'm going to go last I would say be

00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:04,990
open in in understanding that the

00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:06,970
community over code concept is sort of

00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:09,700
internalized different-different least

00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:11,500
by everyone you know your interpretation

00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:13,330
of community over code may not be the

00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,770
same as somebody else's and even though

00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:17,440
we have you know all this documentation

00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:19,630
and this thing about you know how we do

00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,420
how we describe it it might be slightly

00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:26,980
different and just to be aware of that

00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:29,110
and to not get into the battle of you

00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:32,050
know I'm Titan you know and you're wrong

00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:34,840
that previous scenario but just to say

00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:38,350
hey you know and we've got different

00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:41,080
opinions about how we do this but the

00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:43,240
community is the thing that we both care

00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:48,160
about we have this common goal and

00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:52,840
that's all that matters my answer would

00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:54,850
be to give permission and you know

00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,920
there's there's the technical side of it

00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:59,170
where if you're a software project you

00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:01,570
should hand out commit rights like candy

00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:03,250
because this is why you have revision

00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:06,220
control if somebody screws up the code

00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:10,540
you revert it right so there is no risk

00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:13,810
in giving someone commit bit early

00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:16,060
there's no such thing as as giving them

00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:18,550
commitments too early because you can

00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:23,980
revert changes and then on the social

00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:26,440
side give people permission say I you

00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:30,070
know you have great ideas - please come

00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:32,440
implement them ask people please come

00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:34,900
and help us don't assume that they're

00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:37,120
just going to show up but but go pursue

00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:40,150
them and say you have permission to do

00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,950
this thing I just want to add that that

00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:44,260
it might be true the subversion is not

00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:46,360
as to forget because you can just

00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:48,490
overwrite 3po

00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:51,190
I just want to say give it time and

00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:52,540
don't look at how well all our projects

00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:54,950
are doing you can look at how they're

00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:56,569
doing it but don't look at at

00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:59,650
causing say oh this is really really

00:47:56,569 --> 00:48:02,299
going along why's that - my project not

00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:05,329
and growing the community as fast

00:48:02,299 --> 00:48:08,690
because especially in the incubator we

00:48:05,329 --> 00:48:11,540
have 59 projects at the moment and some

00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:13,130
are huge some are popular some have

00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:15,440
companies back in them and then there

00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:18,049
are some they're a small tiny with just

00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:23,000
one or two developers that have an idea

00:48:18,049 --> 00:48:25,160
and that is just that's just life and

00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,660
maybe your project will die maybe it

00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:32,180
will flourish but you're not IBM so stop

00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:35,540
pretending you're I'm not calling IBM

00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:38,750
order to say I'm not IBM so so stop

00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:43,099
pretending you're a big a project and

00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:45,290
look at what they're doing but not don't

00:48:43,099 --> 00:48:48,020
don't get sad because you're not a big

00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:51,589
party give it some time and again if

00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:59,319
your project dies then so be it you'll

00:48:51,589 --> 00:49:02,150
make a new one and yeah all right Dave I

00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:04,000
guess the question was framed of what's

00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:07,160
the one thing you can do to achieve this

00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,859
ideal that is the purpose of the

00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:14,780
foundation so I don't have an answer to

00:49:09,859 --> 00:49:16,400
that specific question but the one thing

00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:19,599
I would say is if you want to just be

00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:23,240
going in the right direction and not

00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:26,329
maybe falling backwards then Justin in

00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:28,460
every interaction that you have with the

00:49:26,329 --> 00:49:31,220
people that are on the project or that

00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:33,980
are otherwise affiliated or interested

00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:36,319
in it try not to be the people we were

00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:39,799
just talking about before so ask

00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:43,250
yourself regularly in in this situation

00:49:39,799 --> 00:49:46,309
if I push back on this proposal

00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:48,890
am I being that guy or am i acting like

00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:51,290
a BD FL and what kind of impact is that

00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:55,160
gonna what message might that be sending

00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:58,640
to people on the other side so in in all

00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:01,040
those interactions try to always be open

00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:04,250
and to you know try to check your own

00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:06,440
sense of you know preference for

00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:10,280
specific direction or your own

00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:12,290
you know sense of wanting to not not let

00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:13,609
it get messed up right because it's

00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:15,200
going to get messed up sometimes that's

00:50:13,609 --> 00:50:17,240
part of the process like we were just

00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,859
saying something can get worse before it

00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:21,609
gets better and often does so just

00:50:18,859 --> 00:50:25,220
embrace that part of of the journey

00:50:21,609 --> 00:50:26,720
awesome so we're going to end with maybe

00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:30,410
two questions and then we're going to

00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:34,640
wrap if there are two questions I mean I

00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:35,900
feel like they solved it all cool well

00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,920
thank you everybody for coming I think

00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:43,449
lunch is neck

00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:43,449
