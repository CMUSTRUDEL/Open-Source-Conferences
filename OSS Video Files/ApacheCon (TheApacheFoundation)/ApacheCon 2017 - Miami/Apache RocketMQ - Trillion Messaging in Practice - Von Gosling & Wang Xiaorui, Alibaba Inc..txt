Apache Software Foundation as a capital

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,680
project that was a huge step for us and

00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:46,039
it's not an easy thing to make it

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,980
through a patch the compatible

00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:56,750

giant Alibaba is our Chinese e-commerce

00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:06,210
company that provides

00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:09,810
consumer-to-consumer penis to consumer

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,679
and the penis - penis sales service were

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,100
Internet

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:17,280
it also provides electronic payments

00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:20,280
towards our shop inserted engine and the

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:25,130
data center cloud computing so is the

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:28,890
Alibaba Group begin in 1999 when Sigma

00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:31,530
founded the website Alibaba calm a penis

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:34,130
- penis protocol talk negative Chinese

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:39,239
manufacturer with overseas buyers

00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:41,010
uniting in in 2016

00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,110
arrival as double 11 shopping festival

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,950
the world's biggest online shopping

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:50,299
event generating sixteen point eight

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,299
billion dollars

00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:01,540
Alibaba is like a bridge that links the

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:08,800
USC and the China as this the picture

00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:12,820
described so what Alibaba H is a

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,340
international marketplace with over 400

00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:19,030
and certain meaning active members from

00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:21,970
over 2,000 countries and regions it is

00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:24,580
truly global marketplace you can team

00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:31,570
Alibaba as their China's Amazon at the

00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:33,640
EPA combo so next let let's get back to

00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:36,850
the main point of your chemical as the

00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:43,630
math illusion I will introduce your

00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:46,390
chemicals history firstly notify yo can

00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:49,480
cause prototype products it will both

00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:53,170
from our multicolored dope reject and

00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:56,080
the coming to playing 2007 it is

00:03:53,170 --> 00:04:00,040
designed for penis to customer treating

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,140
for example you placed an order in Kabul

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,270
the system will send two messages to

00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:07,230
Becca and story so the downstream

00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:12,220
service Rio subscriber and the twosome

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:14,710
complex's penis about the 2010 Arriba

00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:18,400
another of his P to be designed a new

00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:22,810
messenger engine named Napoleon it alone

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:25,990
from the Iraqi femurs messages and a kmq

00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:28,480
way developing a new console for MQ

00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:31,240
results administration and the monitor

00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,970
using links and notify mechanism for

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:37,690
messaging replication this to messaging

00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:41,250
are designed for treating penis

00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:44,380
especially for its eventual consistency

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:47,140
transaction demand and now they are

00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:50,800
combined into one message engine about

00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:53,260
the 2011 we start to research a new

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,960
architecture not only for trading but

00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:58,720
also for streaming process message

00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,970
messages accumulation ordering a message

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,300
and so on through several years of

00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:06,220
technical improvement and evolution the

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,889
third generation distribute the

00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,949
messaging middleware you can kill in

00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:14,830
now capable of transferring trainings of

00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:18,909
messages in alibaba's mm shopping

00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:21,279
festival last year we donated no

00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:23,379
chemical to a backseat we hope to grow

00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,919
the pace of contributions through about

00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:28,900
three and we are happy to carry all

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:41,020
valuable feedback contribution from

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:44,080
outside of our Baba now including -

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:47,409
broad based on prescribed the abbot's

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,199
Ephrem integration module the ally

00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:52,889
system ignite and slap and a static

00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:52,889
integration module

00:05:57,809 --> 00:06:05,619
next we all so next away or some of the

00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:08,849
main sense of for a biochemical way

00:06:05,619 --> 00:06:12,489
divided into five directions first one

00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:15,219
application integration such as the EAP

00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:18,039
for example we want to add on an

00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:21,699
application integrate with another go

00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:24,099
language application seminary loosens

00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:26,139
the coupling between application no

00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:28,989
doubt that's our main function for

00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:32,889
message engine certainly bankable for

00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:36,369
ETA out CEP architecture as we know CEP

00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:45,449
even the processing tolerate multiple

00:06:36,369 --> 00:06:46,689
messaging reason given time frames since

00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:48,639
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:51,909
real chemical has challenges of the task

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:56,829
of halting alibaba's turbo 11 shopping

00:06:51,909 --> 00:07:00,489
presto multi types during the 2016

00:06:56,829 --> 00:07:03,399
festival geochemical robustly provided

00:07:00,489 --> 00:07:05,739
stable infrastructure with the transpose

00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:08,529
report of more than one training

00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:10,979
messages we can see clear from the

00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,979
seekers

00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,159
okay that's all thank you very much for

00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:22,389
your attention next to my partner

00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:22,389
Waldo Selene welcome

00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:33,199

yeah I guess this is also your first

00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:42,259
journey to Apache or chemical all

00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:45,139
outside China yeah

00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:47,659
so let's clean up the moon can write is

00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:57,729
to start with me hoping I am qualified

00:07:47,659 --> 00:08:02,059
guided to for Apache I can kill sorry

00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:05,300
I'm excited to start here my name is ron

00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:09,050
gotlin you can call me one I came I came

00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:12,199
into Alibaba after graduation a country

00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:14,379
in charge of Alibaba and clong clong are

00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:17,419
aware and queue and surely long

00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:21,289
discussion people this is our commercial

00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:25,279
diffusion for a bachelor camp you decide

00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:28,520
I am also an open source fanatic my ink

00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:31,039
it includes the tribution sit-ins clone

00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:34,539
computing and a big dater yeah I'm also

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,539
the Agilent cubic meter

00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:46,940
oh these are some more contains in part

00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:50,000
two this is the agenda rate first one I

00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:53,030
will use some graph to describe Rajaram

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,700
cubes architecture following is rock and

00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:58,520
kills cone features besides I will

00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:02,090
introduce some hair lever commercial

00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:05,420
features in alleyway mq in the second I

00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:09,460
will cover the device devops topic for

00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:13,190
rock mq that's about a monitoring and

00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:17,000
administering certainly I will introduce

00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:19,940
full strike performance tuning in

00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,210
buildings from operating system to rock

00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:26,270
chemically slide its biker in our

00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:29,480
preparation for alibaba's in total 11

00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:32,060
shocking festival last but not least i

00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,120
will show applying for next generation

00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:37,810
of a bad shot and killed what do we want

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,810
it to be

00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:50,490
so let's make her clothes crown for rock

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:53,900
mq a light sky started with the domain

00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:57,960
model we can see the five concept

00:09:53,900 --> 00:10:01,500
methods topic group Q and offside

00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:03,270
as we know message is the data payload

00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:07,020
includes three parts

00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:10,590
haider payload and appropriate i will

00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:13,940
i'm aside to important profits largest

00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:17,610
magic IP and the messages key

00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:19,320
we are inducted for message the former

00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:23,670
is unique hosted turnkey consider

00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,980
messages it's logical it's life we are

00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:28,890
message key is very interesting design

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:31,440
not Hank you give your chance to

00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:34,200
impacting your message according to your

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,720
logical that's a message key learning

00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,530
intention another important consult

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,740
conceptual is outside light cruiser you

00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:47,580
can use either position and time

00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:52,530
property to introspect ur your previous

00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:56,720
message so other concept is similar to

00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:56,720
traditional method known needed to say a

00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:05,100
lot and fuel consists of a full pots

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:08,280
name servers brokers producers and

00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:11,610
consumers as shooting this pager each of

00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:13,560
them can be her identically extended

00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,410
without the single point of failure

00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:19,320
Nym servers provide lightweight service

00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:21,470
discovery and the routine each name

00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,300
server recalled full routing information

00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:28,230
provides equivalent to reading and

00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:30,320
writing service and supposed for storage

00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:33,300
expansion

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,360
workers take care of message storage by

00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:39,450
providing light light weekly mechanism

00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,210
with which messages are grouped by topic

00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:45,950
it's a positive hot it's opposed for

00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:48,690
tolerance mechanism capacity of a

00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:52,110
communicating hundreds of aliens method

00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:55,320
in their original time order in addition

00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:58,920
brokers provide the data recovery

00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:01,560
imagine starting producers of house

00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:04,430
distributive deployment the students

00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:07,520
producers then message to the broker

00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:10,380
through multiple load balancing loads

00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:13,670
the sending precise suppose a fossil

00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:16,020
filler and have a lower latency

00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:18,300
consumers also suppose that it builds

00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:20,700
deployment it also supposed cluster

00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,340
consumption and the method broadcaster

00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:26,220
in provide real-time messages

00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:31,680
subscription mechanism that makes most

00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:35,490
consumer scenario so this picture

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:38,580
depicts how to send and consume Isis in

00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:41,160
high availability mode the other tool

00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:45,570
involves the object commit log and the

00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:48,480
consumer kill commit log is that an oath

00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:51,900
append only L'Occitane we are consumer

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,270
queue just like catalog for methods each

00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:57,390
consumer has its own in consumer queue

00:12:54,270 --> 00:13:00,660
it is also the ditch it is also the

00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:03,510
distribute each load balancing unit we

00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:10,470
can balance consumer operation between

00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:12,990
this crews taking cigar do - it for

00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:15,320
example I will a lot straighter of

00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:18,810
schedule message how to be handled with

00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:21,290
no producers in the message specifically

00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:24,060
it is a schedule Mattox just Eliza

00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:27,750
deliberate delay consult in GMS -

00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:30,870
specification we provide several daily

00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:34,740
lever the guy demise is all cluttered

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:38,030
clogging is delay level via another

00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:41,610
multi stripe scanning these rooms Puri

00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:43,470
periodically when the time comes putting

00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:46,740
this message in to commit load

00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:48,840
so like general reprocessing logics this

00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,470
message will be dispatched into the

00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,470
consumer pew

00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:58,920
using these are fair and their catalogue

00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,770
affair separation week I easily

00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:08,520
exchanged our matrix Louis like this

00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:10,890
picture depict so the following pictures

00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:13,470
retakes lot ampules server and the

00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:16,080
client layer architecture we have two

00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:18,900
men too many details in here today we

00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:21,410
are not going to elaborate if you are

00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:31,190
interested we can talk about privately

00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:34,980
yeah this is a client ok next we are

00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:40,920
internet Opik Apaches law chemicals calm

00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:43,760
features well so many features I listed

00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:46,320
the many features here all these methods

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:49,580
keeping order of message is an

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:53,490
appearance fee Chur of rock mq it's only

00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:55,980
preserved global alden when each message

00:14:53,490 --> 00:15:00,230
can be marked by a unique hash table

00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:03,960
type such as a seller account and other

00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:07,500
number broadcast message you can use it

00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:10,320
to enable individuals and organizations

00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,990
to reach large groups of people quickly

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,480
Alison Martinez lay but no guarantee

00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:18,390
message reachable there is no more to

00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:21,750
say so guide you my Zatanna transaction

00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:25,170
message on the way not writing this

00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:27,090
feature I will describe later - mask it

00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:30,870
is a new feature in the locker release

00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:33,240
we provide election feed interface to

00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:36,780
allow you to stand batch the message one

00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:39,270
time when we met if you are not

00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:42,030
concerned your if you are not concerned

00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:44,610
about your method availability you can

00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:46,800
using one-way message sending your

00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:51,060
message to broker and a no way to act

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:53,340
from broker cheeseball message we can

00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:56,670
use it to do method linked health check

00:15:53,340 --> 00:16:00,240
and monitoring rhetoric retroactive

00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:03,770
message we can use position and the time

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:07,700
life to records back to previous methods

00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:11,360
my city building we can use a tiger to

00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:13,930
get what we wanted our upcoming version

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,300
introduced a new way to polish here as

00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:21,740
the economic you will use structured

00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:24,080
query language 92 tonight x2 constructor

00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:28,630
method future expression making a mole

00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:32,000
fine-grained filtering myseif cumulation

00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:36,350
because we separate data and the catalog

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,779
fail irish consumer has a owner consumer

00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:42,200
queue it's only store message consumers

00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:45,260
teachers so we can see rocking and cue

00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:47,779
can accumulate a message as long as

00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:52,370
having enough disk without performance

00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:54,760
loss back off graphics it is different

00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:58,339
for producer and the consumer if

00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:01,339
consumer always consult consumes failure

00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:06,130
rock mq will send this message into

00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:10,699
global dyed lighter kill delivery

00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:12,500
quality of solids almost all of the NQ

00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:16,040
product claims your feature of

00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:19,220
delivering at least one except rock mq

00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:21,020
is no exception currently not mq

00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,569
does not check for method in

00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:26,569
complication leading users who build or

00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:29,690
buy they are one external global storage

00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:32,210
for reproof either the next generation

00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:35,800
of rock mq however we are supposed to

00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:38,450
this feature we hope to support several

00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:41,300
quality of service of duplication

00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:45,640
message detection eliminating the

00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,640
duplication in various time line so

00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:53,150
let's make a little more detail about

00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:55,420
our on the way features this is of the

00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:59,000
Guardian message yeah

00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:02,690
just no doubt it is like Ling it's

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,150
timing timing we like a reason but we

00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:08,890
use hierarchical timing wheel to get

00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,890
more fine granularity

00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:18,180
well this is another unloved on the fly

00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:21,690
features about to rock MQ transaction

00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:24,600
message even to leak incident last take

00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:27,090
account transfer for example Volvo and

00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:30,960
it meets our friend Bob along to

00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:33,690
transfer $100 to Smith once we what

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,570
would would he do there are two

00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:40,020
important actions subscriber one

00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:43,650
subscriber one $100 from Bubba Smith

00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:46,100
from from bubble account from the metal

00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:50,480
to tells us miss account to either

00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:54,120
confounding dollar if we use amp you to

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,480
solve this problem and firstly we are

00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,790
releasing the hot metal to broker

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:05,510
secondly we will do local operations

00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:08,300
just a like subscribe substructure $100

00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:11,790
in local transaction

00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:17,370
according to local operation without we

00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:19,160
will commit all robot the sex robot this

00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:22,500
transaction

00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:25,890
according this without broker we are

00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:29,640
coming all robot this this message as

00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:32,100
this picture depicts so this way we can

00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:39,990
reach our consistence eventually

00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:44,310
consistent so next we please allow me to

00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:46,290
introduce anywhere on cue our commercial

00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:49,170
distribution call and kill this is our

00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:52,470
portal yeah I will give us a brief

00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:53,750
introduction for is a for Ally where mq

00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:58,680
features

00:19:53,750 --> 00:20:00,650
firstly we you in allie ware mq we

00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:03,120
developed or a high availability

00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:06,750
different form audience also have

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:10,020
ability from this literature we can see

00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:13,530
clearly we are these health two

00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:16,890
important components controller and the

00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:20,310
zookeeper here controller provides

00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:22,260
would watch broker status change handles

00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:24,830
these machines as

00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:27,690
and post news theaters to leak a

00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:30,720
zookeeper provides maintain protecting

00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:33,600
state machine meeting if family brokers

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:40,380
leaders and notification when the

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:43,650
monster has deductr so this is another

00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:46,530
our messaging feature about the

00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:49,370
messenger if this board from the teacher

00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:53,250
we can easily track the messages deters

00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:57,140
letters such as leaders in such high

00:20:53,250 --> 00:21:01,980
taxes subside sent success delivery and

00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:07,950
consumer feeder now this is our method

00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:10,340
of visualization of trajectory within

00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:14,700
play we publish this feature

00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:19,260
Capcom message Louis now you can send a

00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:22,950
message to broker and consume it using

00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:29,730
lock and cue client so this is a action

00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:32,610
west water oh this is another exciting

00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:35,790
feature in tonight's thing we can

00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:39,140
publish message through MQTT protocol as

00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:42,150
we know mqtt is emerging to Mercy

00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:44,430
Internet of Things connectivity protocol

00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:47,340
it was designed as an extremely

00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:51,800
lightweight publish and subscriber

00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:55,620
messaging it is widely used in Algeria

00:21:51,800 --> 00:22:00,380
so next topic about our dev of

00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:00,380
monitoring and other misc Turing

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,940
firstly lights go in back and repeat

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,729
this picture this is our dowel

00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:13,669
architecture the Dalton the bottom

00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:17,989
layers is about kernel cheese points up

00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:21,139
rock MQ has expose is the open API

00:22:17,989 --> 00:22:25,159
without AC open based on this open API

00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:29,539
we can use I'm killed me choose a graph

00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:37,789
dashboard to Adam is treating our anchor

00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:40,129
results MAGIX and operations so I will

00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:43,129
show you the most frequently commander

00:22:40,129 --> 00:22:46,429
for encode me as this pager depict if

00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:55,099
you click the include me it will lead to

00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:57,859
some information I've here we can look

00:22:55,099 --> 00:23:01,489
at the outpost of the class if the using

00:22:57,859 --> 00:23:05,329
cluster cluster listing option we can

00:23:01,489 --> 00:23:09,429
see our output is such as the clutter

00:23:05,329 --> 00:23:14,539
name broker named broker ID or drives

00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:24,229
perversion in TPS out of TP is the

00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:27,950
broker living and this QC uses slave so

00:23:24,229 --> 00:23:30,709
another option for uncle or the main is

00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:33,320
consumer status if you want to look at

00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:35,799
your consumers if you can click this

00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,799
matter

00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:48,190
we can see another option about MQM a

00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:50,710
query message by key that is what's

00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:54,249
outside before if you click this

00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:58,450
commander leans it in in shell you can

00:23:54,249 --> 00:24:06,419
look at the other folder like this qad

00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:09,879
is the crew ID so how inquiry message

00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:12,399
details to achieve it yeah because of a

00:24:09,879 --> 00:24:14,860
big problem I just leaves us some

00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:18,549
fragment here there are more information

00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:22,659
about message about methods you can't

00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:25,809
read in your computer this commander you

00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:29,980
can use to look your detail about your

00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:34,509
message such as this method topics this

00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:38,049
matches the local types Keys q ID q of

00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:43,710
site commit log off site we can still

00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:47,710
time the message ball the messages Dom

00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:51,789
message born from where stone from where

00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:53,769
sit-ins like and the properties yeah it

00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:56,950
is the judge the iceberg of a message

00:24:53,769 --> 00:25:03,240
you can look you can click you can try

00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:07,299
in computer click this commander so

00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:09,909
coming to next topic about the chemical

00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:11,799
performance tuning I will share I will

00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:16,200
share our thinking about rock mq

00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:16,200
performance - in experience with years

00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:22,740
like you can read picture we abstract

00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:26,080
our performance during into dictator

00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:29,529
within our application from this

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:33,669
production Java applications we use

00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:37,869
clean code static code under title code

00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:42,850
analyst effective concurrent we use log

00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:46,480
freak dieter dieter dieter grade and the

00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:49,629
back own algorithm ad for Java Virtual

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,890
Machine we replace you we play we using

00:25:49,629 --> 00:25:54,560
G 1 garbage collection

00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:57,860
algorithm to replace CNF yeah we're

00:25:54,560 --> 00:26:02,750
using adjusting time comply to inline

00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:07,460
some lots of frequently visitor we using

00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:12,280
with Ewing TV I'm option to avoid double

00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:16,880
the world is mostly low latency reason

00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:19,220
so as for Linux kernel we are because a

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:25,010
virtual computer heavily depend on page

00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:29,230
cry so we try our path to a wield a bad

00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:29,230
cat flush and the page fault

00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:39,890
so using these tips we achieve our

00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,870
relative satisfactory result the

00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:44,530
following screen shot which relies the

00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:46,040
low chemical behavior in throughput and

00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:49,670
latency

00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:51,500
our machine with the configuration yeah

00:26:49,670 --> 00:27:00,770
we can see from this feature

00:26:51,500 --> 00:27:08,360
welcome to head with about 55 500 tick

00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:11,140
as the size of our body is a 120 eyelid

00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,140
and 28

00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:19,370
so from last year's double-double 11

00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:23,540
shocking friends will replace the

00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:26,419
hollyrock mq broker achieve light 1999

00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:29,030
first nineteen nineteen point nineteen

00:27:26,419 --> 00:27:32,630
nineteen oh six percent of the delay

00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:35,270
within 10 milliseconds under nineteen

00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:40,610
ninety point six percent we are delayed

00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:44,049
we are within 1 million seconds so next

00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:46,580
topic about the rock chemical future

00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:52,760
talking about future is full of changes

00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:55,070
a fragile chemical with no exception we

00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:59,390
hope up hydraulic mq the fourth

00:27:55,070 --> 00:28:03,410
generation are oriented for ecommons in

00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:06,799
this area we mustard we need hero

00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:10,070
concurrency and the next layer that

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:14,270
internet of thing in this area we we

00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:17,990
need we must keep the we must keep the

00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:22,400
massive online service so the third area

00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:26,840
is a fan nice when in this area we need

00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:30,710
we need our broker high availability and

00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:33,320
the net is a high it's a big digital

00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:36,309
direction in digital we need high

00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,309
throughput

00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:47,780
so this is our development line we have

00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:49,670
published it on our website if you are

00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,590
interested with these features please

00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:57,920
don't hesitate to join the adventure

00:28:51,590 --> 00:29:01,820
chemical community this is our ecology

00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:05,050
overview we want a practical can queue

00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:08,260
based on open messaging and support

00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:12,440
online analytical processing and

00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:17,510
dreaming precising and of absol offline

00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:19,670
processing do you have noticed the open

00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:22,210
nicety yeah this is the interesting

00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,210
topic

00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:34,679
sorry I will if they located open

00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,960
messaging as we know messaging and the

00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:39,749
streaming products have been widely used

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,269
in modern architecture and the data

00:29:39,749 --> 00:29:46,039
processing for copper for decoupling

00:29:42,269 --> 00:29:49,649
Queen battering elder L during

00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:51,659
replication and so on but when desert

00:29:49,649 --> 00:29:54,450
transfer across different methods and

00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:58,049
the swim platform the capacity

00:29:54,450 --> 00:30:01,320
the compatibility problem arise which

00:29:58,049 --> 00:30:03,240
always need much addition worker open

00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:05,419
messaging is the window neutral and

00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:09,269
language independent a specification

00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:13,470
provide inductor guidelines for areas of

00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:13,830
in finite ecommons internal seen a bit

00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:17,700
later

00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:20,129
an aim to develop and into developed

00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,049
messaging and a streaming application

00:30:20,129 --> 00:30:24,990
across

00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:27,960
hydrogenous system and platforms we want

00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:30,990
is good and effects very satisfying

00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:34,399
modern cloud or until the messaging

00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,399
under streaming application

00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:45,389
so we are always very happy to have

00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:48,570
contributors wiser for tribute cleanups

00:30:45,389 --> 00:30:51,469
or bad new features we want to have high

00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:53,820
quality we are documented codes for each

00:30:51,469 --> 00:30:56,339
programming language and we are at the

00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:58,849
thronging ecosystem of integration tools

00:30:56,339 --> 00:31:01,440
we strongly while your documentation

00:30:58,849 --> 00:31:05,190
integration with other project and

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:09,570
global and the try to excite to improve

00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:12,119
and for these attacks attacks as for

00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:14,489
community we have adopter of granted

00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:18,359
similar to Apache other top-level

00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:21,299
project we interacted with the open

00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:25,139
source communities so activities like

00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:27,839
meet our workshop and the code marathon

00:31:25,139 --> 00:31:34,889
holding more and more contributors and

00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:36,960
the committee's love abide shock mq ok

00:31:34,889 --> 00:31:40,049
this is my sharing thank you for your

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,109
attention by the way I have listed some

00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:45,239
articles about Apache doc mq excited

00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:48,089
except for the further attic attic

00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:51,719
ethical other articles are writing in

00:31:48,089 --> 00:32:01,469
Chinese a much more detailed are here in

00:31:51,719 --> 00:32:03,739
joint thank you so I think question

00:32:01,469 --> 00:32:03,739
about

00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:24,570
yes as a pen pal it would transmit

00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:26,430
messages to your multiple class yeah in

00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:30,000
Oliver they are two so they are about

00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:33,650
the tools and machine yeah we can we

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,270
divided many class for different

00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:38,100
subsidiary you're using among every

00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:41,010
mission Alibaba has lots of become

00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:43,860
subsidiary yeah we have this cluster for

00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:54,630
this subsidiary this class for this yeah

00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:56,640
a single clap sure we have no summer of

00:32:54,630 --> 00:33:02,390
the single class first report any low

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:06,300
latency it is ever so we have we have a

00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:09,170
some tools shelters to monitor and

00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:12,780
metrics the global net global clustering

00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:16,050
so I do you know every culture has a

00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:17,940
different machine skill yeah this

00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:21,150
classroom have many many machine did

00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:25,590
class can have only two machine so we

00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:28,770
have note yeah the 1 billion to 1

00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:31,550
trillion message is a global yeah global

00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,550
support yes

00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:43,440
and a Linux kernel yeah are those places

00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:46,290
where you see a lot of slow down for

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,030
proposed money how significant how those

00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:51,950
changes that we're a lot of good

00:33:48,030 --> 00:34:01,140
decisions you are or if the slow link

00:33:51,950 --> 00:34:04,020
inside rocket in Houston is with rocket

00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:06,480
if you for example gain from patches to

00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:13,110
the Linux curve for example rather than

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:17,100
just tuning yeah we tuning the in kernel

00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:19,920
some parameters yeah as we know low

00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:21,930
latency and for memory oxides there are

00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:26,430
two reasons for low latency

00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:29,970
yes the first one is a memory clean yeah

00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:33,180
Ali rock mqr heavily depend on page

00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:35,010
cache so we must tune in this first the

00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:38,760
second is a page fault

00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:41,220
yeah we're using M log memory log yeah

00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:44,640
not have as much as opposed as much as a

00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:48,000
pitch coach yes so avoids wipeout and

00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:52,070
it's working so to achieve this low

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:55,230
latency besides we have a tuning summer

00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:58,830
algorithm about messaging protectants

00:34:55,230 --> 00:35:04,940
algorithm using data just as a log free

00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:08,099
algorithm yeah yes

00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:11,630
attention you had me monster and a

00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:11,630
broker and the slave workers

00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:18,490
can you have a fateful war between so I

00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:21,100
give the master broker dice will the

00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:25,330
slave broker become the man yeah yeah

00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:29,400
yeah yeah so you dictate your chemicals

00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:33,480
design so they must flavor flavor flavor

00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:38,470
broker it's a data a consumer of a

00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:43,390
master so when we look in the master the

00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:48,090
doctor comes looking the the standby

00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:48,090
yeah senpai broker will put it down

00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:01,220
what is there

00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:07,370
do they go to the main server or is it

00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:10,850
automatic yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we're

00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:14,300
using zookeeper yeah we're looking okay

00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:28,670
/ - to monitor the to monitor the status

00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:30,620
of the master - Ike yeah yeah yeah you

00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:39,310
missed you question about is about an

00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:39,310
informer and all Brooklyn yeah yeah yeah

00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,270
any question yes

00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:15,050
yeah

00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:24,740
you mentioned a - sighs message so your

00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:27,770
question is a kill yeah yeah notice the

00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:30,650
way from provider interface the

00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:33,380
interface how one parameters of this

00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:36,860
parameter is a collection API now we're

00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:39,710
using this collection this collection to

00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:43,220
send in batch message you can assemble

00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:46,940
your messaging your union code yeah it

00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:49,790
is that it is not like a Calcutta you

00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:52,040
know II think tried to accumulate your

00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:55,040
passage yeah within this mess with this

00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:57,980
method slightly rich a country into yeah

00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:01,090
so the met through the broker is no

00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:01,090
chemicals does not life

00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:08,170
oh yes

00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:36,410
Oh

00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:56,190
yeah we were using some magics to love

00:38:52,500 --> 00:39:00,440
this this here you know and the statics

00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:03,930
using this value to logic tool to log

00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:06,450
what the message have not been consumer

00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:09,170
and wasn't magic and not being started

00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:09,170
but isn't

00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:32,560
yeah this is average value average value

00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:38,440
yeah

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:38,440
average value thank you

00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:44,230
