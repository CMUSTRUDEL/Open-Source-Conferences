	User Groups: The Gateway to Apache - Bob Paulin, Independent Consultant

When we think of user groups most of us think of code, conversations, and cold beverages. However, they can be so much more. User groups can be a powerful tool to help promote open source ecosystems like the ASF. Bob brings several years of experience serving in many roles within the Chicago Java User Group, one of the largest Java user groups in the world. During his tenure, Bob has promoted open source through activities, topic selection, and community development. Bob will discuss ways to engage communities within the ASF to get speakers, set up activities to promote open source, match sponsors to help fund these activities, and grow members to be more active in software communities. Come discuss things that work, things that don't, and bring some great ideas home to make your local software community one people won't want to leave.
