Description: 
	User Groups: The Gateway to Apache - Bob Paulin, Independent Consultant

When we think of user groups most of us think of code, conversations, and cold beverages. However, they can be so much more. User groups can be a powerful tool to help promote open source ecosystems like the ASF. Bob brings several years of experience serving in many roles within the Chicago Java User Group, one of the largest Java user groups in the world. During his tenure, Bob has promoted open source through activities, topic selection, and community development. Bob will discuss ways to engage communities within the ASF to get speakers, set up activities to promote open source, match sponsors to help fund these activities, and grow members to be more active in software communities. Come discuss things that work, things that don't, and bring some great ideas home to make your local software community one people won't want to leave.

all right well welcome everybody so who

00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:08,400
here exists their very first Apache con

00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:11,849
all right we got some new folks so you

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,469
guys having a good time all right so I'm

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,289
so excited that you guys came to my talk

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:18,660
because this talk is really about how

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,619
you can bring this experience home with

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,020
you

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,820
so if you're having a good time here my

goal is to give you guys the tools and

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,289
the knowledge of why you might want to

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:30,599
get involved in user groups what you can

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:35,550
do with user groups and how user groups

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:37,530
may benefit you as Ana ASF committer

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,440
contributor or just even just somebody

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,450
interested so we'll start off with just

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,180
a little bit about me so I'm an

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,829
independent consultant from Chicago so

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,120
it's actually warm there right now so

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,149
I'm actually don't have that much of a

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:55,739
bump in the temperature I've been an a

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:58,500
SF member for about a year now my work I

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,949
was recently made a Java champion which

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,290
essentially is I'm involved in a Java

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:05,820
user group and as part of my work with

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,229
the group we do a number of programs

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,990
which I'm going to talk about with you

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:13,409
today which led to my election into that

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,210
body of people I'm currently the CFO of

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,630
the Chicago job user group so we're one

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:25,200
of the largest organizations in Chicago

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:27,720
for the user group community so gay and

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm also a podcaster I do two different

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,189
podcasts so if you're interested in

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,490
technology and learning about Java and

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:38,070
how the JVM works the Java pub house

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:41,490
podcast is one I do with Freddy gimmi

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:44,780
where we go deep into different things

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,740
in the JVM we go into how to write

00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,479
software using a lot of different

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,250
open-source libraries and it's really

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,689
you know kind of an approachable podcast

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,579
if you're just getting into Java and you

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:55,799
want to learn new things about the

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,689
language the other one-off heap is more

00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,490
of the pundits podcast who here has

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:02,939
heard of the Java posse anybody heard of

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:06,240
them okay not a whole lot there they've

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,740
been gone for some time now but it's

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,840
basically a pundants podcast where we

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,760
talked about news things and open source

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,690
you know like the you know the Google

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,960
Oracle lawsuit and thing

00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:19,600
relevant for the JVM there so these are

00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,700
things that I've been working on for the

00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:26,500
past couple years but most recently I've

00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:28,360
been working on an app so recently went

00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,180
into production about a month and a half

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,660
ago so I just wanted to share that with

00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,770
you guys this is my app so you know

00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,390
we've been working on for about nine

00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:40,180
months he's in production he's doing

00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,610
great and this is what this talk is

00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,190
really about as well it's about building

00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:48,370
for the future building for people that

00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:51,040
are going to be using open-source 20 30

00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,450
years from now because what it ends up

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,080
coming down to is it's all about

00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:57,850
community and this guy's an MVP he does

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,800
three things very well he eats he sleeps

00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,480
and he poops very well those are the

00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,920
three things and we're going to build a

00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:09,610
community around different things for

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:14,440
Apache so let's talk about you

00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:17,950
so who here as bet is involved with an

00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:21,190
Apache project we've got a lot of folks

00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:25,570
expected a lot of folks great who here

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:27,790
also attends user groups okay so we got

00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,380
some user group folks who thinks user

00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,830
groups are all about drinking beer and

00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:36,220
socializing no really nobody okay Tom I

00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:37,900
knew I'd get Tom but who here is like

00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,640
wait there's beer and pizza at these

00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:43,239
things how do I can you do a talk about

00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,400
that because I want that really nobody

00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,080
you guys have already figured out the

00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,860
beers any men all right well I've got

00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,300
tips on that later as well

00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:56,380
so is anybody involved in like the

00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:59,260
actual running of user group ok got a

00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:01,030
few folks perfect so this is my ideal

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,989
audience folks that go to user groups

00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:06,670
are involved in Apache and are at my

00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:11,050
talk so you might be interested in doing

00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:12,760
more all right so when I was looking to

00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,470
write this talk and kind of start off

00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,760
with this philosophical question about

00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,519
you know how did I get here

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,940
how did we get here becoming a SF

00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:24,400
members at the end of the day you think

00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,470
back to when you get into a into Apache

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,280
or how you got involved and it's really

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,630
you

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,060
think about it very much a revisionist

00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,220
history we kind of reinvents how we got

00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,770
in and or how difficult it was and what

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:38,770
it felt like getting into the

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,780
organization sometimes we'll forget you

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,790
know if it was a specific JIRA or if

00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,010
there was a specific person involved and

00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,630
what I'd like to do is try to get back

00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,340
to that and try to bring you back to

00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,620
that experience and think of how it was

00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,510
and think of whether is there easier

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,120
ways that that could have happened for

00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,650
you and then think back on the impact

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,720
that it had on your life and getting

00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,730
involved in the ASF you know for many of

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,340
us it was a pretty big deal pretty big

00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,419
career thing for our careers it could

00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,910
have just been a big thing for us

00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:09,270
socially or just our self-esteem having

00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:12,640
that you know either member committer

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,710
contributor having a passion it feels

00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,000
really good right so what we're trying

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:20,140
to do is we're trying to get that out

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,080
some more people so when you think about

00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:26,680
what we're trying to do here what it

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:29,620
makes the ASF special to us so I mean is

00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,330
it code of course we produce code is it

00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,360
the process the process where we have

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:36,070
community over code in our in our

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,190
ecosystem is it the fact of how we do

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:41,110
releases is that that is it the brand is

00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:44,229
that the fact that we have this brand of

00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:49,510
what Apache makes that is unique and is

00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:51,130
difficult to replicate well when you're

00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,630
thinking of what an organization is

00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,130
about it usually comes back to the

00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,350
mission statement and when you start

00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,729
with Apache you're making software for

00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,950
the public good so we're all just

00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:01,570
altruist right that's that's really all

00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:04,500
there is to this we're just trying to do

00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:07,600
good by creating open-source software

00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,729
well if you keep reading there's and

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,729
there's an additional spot to this where

00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:16,180
it talks about providing services and

00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:17,890
support for the people like for many

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:21,100
like-minded software projects and

00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:23,050
communities so I mean if you think

00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,570
open-source is important the

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,310
Foundation's goal is to support those

00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:32,020
like-minded people and to bring them

00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:34,390
together the organization the foundation

00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:37,479
is really about growing people in

00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:40,810
growing communities so in order to serve

00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:42,910
that you know kind of like my app

00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:45,030
to grow people that are maybe getting

00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:47,410
into open-source or maybe they're just

00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:49,480
trying to figure out the way to get in

00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:54,630
and have them have a successful

00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:57,100
experience with that you know

00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:59,740
specifically you know people that were

00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,660
trying to produce useful software with

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:06,010
these communities so growing them is

00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:08,320
extremely important but often the part

00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:10,060
we forget is how hard it was to get in

00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,130
or maybe it was easy for you but maybe

00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,840
that's revisionist history because when

00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,490
we think about what we did to take that

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,440
first step there's kind of a

00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,830
survivorship bias you know the people

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,940
that got in well you're already in so

00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,800
must have been something I did right

00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,870
right sometimes we don't even know what

00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,120
we were actually doing properly that

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:31,570
that got us into what we're doing right

00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:35,110
now and we forget about all of these

00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:37,030
other things that go on that maybe our

00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:39,760
resistance to people trying to get into

00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:41,260
open-source nope when you sent off that

00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,320
first pull request to that first

00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:46,270
passionate JIRA you weren't really sure

00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,530
what was going to happen with it most of

00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,780
the time you're just waiting for

00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:51,820
somebody to bring back judgment or

00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:55,270
perhaps tell you what they well maybe

00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:58,150
this and do this differently and you

00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:59,680
know there's cases where perhaps some

00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,590
encourage events or some things along

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,270
the way would have and maybe we didn't

00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:09,610
even notice it that was very important

00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:10,750
but we all got passive and the people in

00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:15,090
this room and the people that are

00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:17,680
involved with the ASF have kind of a

00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:19,600
have some sort of status or you could

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,270
call it just kind of an achievement that

00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,860
not a lot of people have right so if you

00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,900
look at your general user group

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,970
community and you walk around and talk

00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,520
to people how many people that you run

00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:32,349
into that are ASF committers that are

00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,539
ASF members you're kind of in the

00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:36,130
minority so people are looking to you

00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:39,180
and that and you have something that a

00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:41,800
lot of these people and user groups want

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,959
so keep that in mind and when you're

00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,660
working with people and that are saying

00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:48,160
well how did you get into it you know

00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,410
the first thing that came out of my

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,700
mouth just when people ask this question

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,170
is well you got to go join the mailing

00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,590
list you know get involved in the

00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:58,210
mailing

00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:59,890
and you know when that comes out you

00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,570
know you do think about back and you're

00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,850
like well I just got involved in the

00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:05,950
mailing list and you know everything

00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,780
just kind of worked out from there

00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,400
but people forget what getting

00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:13,330
introduced to a mailing list feels like

00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:15,340
right often you're not really sure what

00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:17,440
that reply is going to look like is

00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:20,140
somebody going to come and tell me that

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,990
Oh what I'm doing is not really what we

00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:26,440
want to do in this project it leaves

00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:29,560
open to chance that that person may have

00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,960
a good or a bad experience and again

00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,820
it's because we're thinking in terms of

00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:37,180
where this distributed group of software

00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:39,700
engineers and you know we don't always

00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:42,130
have a local face-to-face community to

00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,840
bring us together to help people through

00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:48,430
some of these things that they would be

00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:52,000
facing on their own so what we really

00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:54,340
need is an incubator for people we have

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,590
incubators for software but we need

00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:59,410
incubators for people to help people

00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:01,000
cross that large chasm that sometimes

00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:05,260
they're between somebody that's just a

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,090
casual open-source user to a committed

00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:09,760
open-source committer

00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:13,060
member that's contributing back and

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:17,170
providing value to their community so

00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:19,660
you know how how do we bring these

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,490
people together so that we can help them

00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:24,130
cross this chasm and a lot of times it

00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:27,730
is just having some support there for

00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:29,650
these people to learn how to contribute

00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:31,660
properly to open source and engage the

00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:37,330
community in ways that we've all learned

00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:39,070
but is not necessarily that intuitive so

00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:41,740
here's where user groups can help and

00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:45,010
this is this is my pitch to the Apache

00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:47,110
community because with beer and pizza we

00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:48,880
can fix anything right as developers

00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:51,910
that's the only two inputs we really

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,960
require and user groups because nobody

00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,190
else raised their hand for the beer

00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,540
question I'm assuming you're getting

00:10:54,190 --> 00:11:00,790
that so what we can do with user groups

00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,710
is creating queue Bader's for people

00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,930
within the user groups you know user

00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,600
groups allow face-to-face interactions

00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,190
between developers

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,319
which takes some of the sting out of

00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:14,459
something coming from the other side of

00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:16,980
the world over the internet it is a low

00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:18,990
bar of entry right for me to go to a

00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:22,050
user group I don't have to do anything I

00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:25,920
just have to sign up and show up and

00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:27,389
take time out of my day to go to that

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,009
user group and it's usually because I

00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:30,899
have some sort of itch that I wanted to

00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:33,209
scratch maybe I'm not getting something

00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:35,880
that I that I wanted to out of my work

00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:39,389
environment and you can meet like-minded

00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:41,639
developers there and when you think

00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:43,980
about the average user group attendee

00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:46,230
there's a lot of overlap between what

00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,769
we're looking for in people that are

00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:51,779
committed to the ASF so my first

00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:53,910
experience going to a user group was I

00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:55,980
was out of place we were building

00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:58,410
software they are still using very

00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:02,040
outdated stack a lot of it was kicks in

00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:05,819
COBOL and open-source was sort of used

00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:10,019
but not really and you know the company

00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:14,220
was as a developer of their technology

00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:16,500
people they didn't always have resources

00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,990
that could help you grow your career so

00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,509
I started looking outside to other

00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:23,160
places that were available to me and one

00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:25,709
of those were that was the Java user

00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,410
group and in going to the Java user

00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:30,389
group I started finding those people

00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:32,279
that I could engage on conversation and

00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:33,839
at the very first time it was like wow

00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:34,980
these people are so much smarter than me

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,800
they're doing all of these cool things

00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,790
with all this new technology how do I do

00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,529
more of that

00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:45,660
so being brought into that community

00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:48,720
already kind of you know it kind of

00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:51,180
pulled me in these people are already

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,279
interested in doing things after work

00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,050
user groups don't happen during the day

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,560
they're kind of inconvenient you know if

00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:00,360
you're just trying to work and go home

00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,790
it's like two hours and then if you have

00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,709
to commute you're spending more time

00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,149
either in the city or wherever you're

00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:08,519
working to go to these user group

00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:10,199
meetings so people already interested at

00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:13,050
work generally that's that's a good

00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:15,209
thing for asf projects you're looking to

00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,620
be a part of something like I said as I

00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:18,180
was working through my work environment

00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,699
I wanted to be a part of something else

00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:23,239
that was in

00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:24,829
important to me and then finally they

00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:26,869
usually have a niche like they're

00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:28,369
selecting a user group for a reason it's

00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:30,529
like I wanted to be better Java

00:13:28,369 --> 00:13:32,749
developer or I want to be to learn

00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:35,720
something about NGO or I want to learn

00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:38,179
something about Apache spark you have

00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,549
user groups there that are specific they

00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:42,499
can teach you specific things and I can

00:13:40,549 --> 00:13:47,809
self-select which of these things that I

00:13:42,499 --> 00:13:49,239
want very much like an Apache project so

00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:51,769
great hopefully I've made some

00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:53,509
compelling argument that user group

00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:55,489
folks or people that we actually want to

00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:58,939
go out and actively recruit into our

00:13:55,489 --> 00:14:03,709
projects as an a SF member committer

00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:05,689
contributor what is it that I have that

00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:09,529
I can offer people in the user group

00:14:05,689 --> 00:14:13,249
community the very first thing that we

00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:15,379
can provide is often speaking about the

00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:17,959
topics at the user groups user groups

00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:19,489
many of them are hurting for speakers

00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:25,299
are always looking for somebody to

00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:28,489
provide content and Apache members

00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:31,039
committers contributors are usually the

00:14:28,489 --> 00:14:33,199
best types of speakers because they're

00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:36,589
not ones pushing some sort of a white

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:39,109
paper right you're you become an Apache

00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:40,970
committer contributor by submitting

00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:44,149
patches and actually getting to know the

00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:46,850
codebase and we have one kind of basic

00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:48,980
rule at the chicago java user group and

00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:52,609
what we want out of our speakers and

00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:55,069
that is when you give a talk whether

00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:57,139
it's proprietary or open-source no

00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:59,449
matter what I should be able to learn

00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:02,569
something without having to pay you

00:14:59,449 --> 00:15:05,029
anything to learn that thing I should be

00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:07,819
able to take home something that you've

00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:09,709
taught me and work on it at home without

00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:13,699
having to go through some sort of a

00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:16,100
paywall Apaches projects already fit

00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:21,079
that definition so we happen to do a lot

00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:22,970
of talks on Apache and you don't have to

00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:24,949
do it all yourself you know the one

00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:27,619
great thing about being a part of a

00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:29,720
community of developers is you have

00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:31,759
contacts within your community within

00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,540
other communities that are maybe related

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,110
and integrate

00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:39,380
with your project so if it's like well

00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:42,140
I'm in the you know the chorus community

00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:44,300
while carafe has integrations with camel

00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,400
and we really want a camel talks can I

00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,840
post something out to look for somebody

00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,670
that the camel contributor to come in

00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,280
and give a talk oh and camel integrates

00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:54,470
everything so well now I want PDF Fox

00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,360
now I want tika now I want you know I

00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,520
can branch out from there in order to

00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,230
make those connections that a lot of

00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,600
these user group leaders may not have

00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:08,330
without being fully engaged in open

00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:10,490
source the other thing is mentorship

00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:13,160
again when we talked about crossing that

00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:15,080
chasm of becoming going from an

00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:19,520
open-source user to an open-source

00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:22,010
contributor most people just have no

00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,840
idea where to get started or what the

00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:26,900
expectations are people that actually

00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,820
have sent patches into open source that

00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,500
kind of feel dejected by it's usually

00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,760
like well I put this pull request out

00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,010
there but nobody's looking at it

00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,540
nobody's doing anything with it so

00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,940
everybody must hate me or they don't

00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,260
like what what I put out there and

00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,090
that's usually not the case because

00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:43,610
teams have projects right there they

00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:45,890
have processes in place of what it

00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:49,160
you're supposed to do in order to commit

00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:52,280
code to the repository and somebody that

00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,540
is aware of these kind of policies or

00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,850
can point people in the right direction

00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,440
can kind of say well okay did you did

00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:00,740
you mention something on the dev list

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,450
you know did you read some of the

00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,710
conversations that happened before maybe

00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:06,980
this was something that was raised

00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:08,450
before and you know there they came up

00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:13,250
with a reason why the community did not

00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:15,050
want this specific feature the other

00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,870
thing that often comes up is you know

00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:19,550
what should I work on you know is there

00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,490
a specific project out there that I

00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:25,520
should be that I should be watching and

00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:27,380
you know being involved in some of the

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,270
other projects out there and incubator

00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,610
is you kind of have some inside baseball

00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:33,530
on what's going on and who's looking for

00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:35,150
people to help out and in truth

00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:37,490
everybody is looking for people to help

00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:40,520
out right we all want more people in our

00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:42,890
communities but often there are specific

00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,930
skill sets that people have that may

00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,370
benefit one community or another like so

00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,470
what are you using at work

00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:50,570
right maybe that's something that you

00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,429
could look into what is your work you

00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:55,360
know do you even have a job that may

00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:57,890
make being an open-source contributor

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,210
difficult so they don't put themselves

00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,919
in a position maybe they have an

00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,890
employment contract where the employer

00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,510
owns everything you know at least having

00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:08,210
that conversation and making people

00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:11,510
aware of different things that are going

00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:13,190
to happen if they do get involved can be

00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:14,840
important if you can have them up front

00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:17,840
you know one of the things that I had

00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,340
with another member of the C judges they

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,070
were like well you know for your tachi

00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:23,570
projects you don't have to like like if

00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,370
you take a pass from somebody else

00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,990
there's no agreement that that person

00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,820
that you took the patch from had to sign

00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,649
it's just the committers that sign it so

00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,590
what happens if what they gave you is

00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:35,000
something that's bad and I'm like uh

00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,529
there should be something on that and I

00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,090
get went through the lists and it's like

00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:40,159
well if you're the one applying the

00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:42,350
patch you're kind of have some

00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:45,799
responsibility for that so it's like

00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:47,659
well I'm glad that I read up on that

00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:49,669
before just applying patches just in

00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:51,350
case I thought that hey I'm off the hook

00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:55,039
you know I'm just I'm just committing it

00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:57,890
to the repo this guy gave it to me so

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,690
you know having people there that are

00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:03,679
able to guide people is very very

00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:06,440
important and we're all everyone in this

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:10,279
room is is is a good candidate to be to

00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:13,190
do that type of mentoring the other

00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:15,649
thing is street credibility so like I

00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:17,750
mentioned there's not if you go to a

00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:20,840
user group anywhere you're not

00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:23,210
necessarily going to find a lot of other

00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:27,080
people that are committees and members

00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:28,700
of the ASF so in general you may get

00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,710
kind of looked up to in these

00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,510
communities and kind of be able to serve

00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:35,000
as a role model to people so they're

00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:37,370
going to look to you at how you interact

00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,610
on your with your communities how you

00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:42,950
interact with people in person and this

00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:44,450
can you know this can get you some some

00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,010
street credibility you know when I go

00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,710
around the meet up and talk about things

00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:50,539
that are going on in the project and and

00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:53,120
you know things things that I've done

00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:55,250
you know I don't think some of them are

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,809
really that big of a deal anymore but

00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:59,000
people that haven't done this to them

00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:00,050
it's like a huge deal it's like wait you

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,700
contributed to

00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:03,680
project and people are running your code

00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,930
like at all of these companies that's

00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:09,820
that's pretty awesome and we sometimes

00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:12,890
forget oh yeah that is pretty awesome so

00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:14,540
the street credibility thing you know we

00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:16,310
can be role models in these in these

00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,520
user group communities and people to

00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:23,650
model off of alright so who's ready to

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:27,110
do this right nobody okay

00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:33,020
Tom are you ready to do this he's

00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:36,380
thinking about it all right so let's get

00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:38,060
into the meat of this is what how does

00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:41,270
this stuff work and if I want to get

00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:44,690
involved in it what is it exactly you're

00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:46,580
asking me to do so the first thing is

00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:48,890
just selecting a group and some of this

00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:51,290
comes down to you know what you want to

00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:54,440
be involved in in Chicago we have a ton

00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:55,820
of user groups we have groups that we

00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,730
these are just some of the ones we've

00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:00,170
worked with the the Chicago Women's

00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:03,620
developers group which is again just

00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:06,710
kind of focused on women developers the

00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:08,360
Chugg is the Hadoop user group as you

00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:13,130
can see they've solved the beer issue as

00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:17,200
well there's a Chicago ACM DevOps you've

00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:20,390
got choices so which one should I pick

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:23,330
they're not all created equal so you

00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:27,050
kind of have to maybe go to a few and

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:30,380
figure out what you're looking for just

00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:33,020
like in the ASF user groups often get

00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:35,060
stuck with this there's some user groups

00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,340
out there that under the guise of an

00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:39,620
open-source user group or a language

00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,720
based user group are really just

00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:43,760
marketing the departments of some

00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,470
corporation that's either looking for

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,000
recruitments or looking to market a

00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:53,270
product my suggestion is to avoid these

00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,620
if you go to these meetups or get

00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,240
involved with them you're going to find

00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:59,480
that most of it is just a big sales

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:02,150
pitch and it's usually very very obvious

00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,160
from the onset what those are because

00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:06,230
you'll go in and you'll get pitched

00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,730
immediately and you won't see any code

00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:09,440
and you won't be able to take anything

00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:12,669
home with you it will violate all of the

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,380
rules that we have for speakers

00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:17,720
the other decision you have is do you

00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:21,169
want to be in a specific group or a

00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,669
general group so one of the things that

00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:25,159
happens if you have a really rich

00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:26,750
ecosystem so Chicago I think has a

00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:28,280
really rich one is you'll have like a

00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:31,250
user group for something very very

00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,320
specific like we'll have a user group

00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,900
just for a specific open source like

00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,760
there's a user group just for Hadoop now

00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:40,970
they've branched out because the Hadoop

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,520
ecosystem is now huge but you know at

00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:46,460
the time if it's just to do you can kind

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,230
of get siloed into one specific

00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,179
technology stack and maybe that's what

00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,799
you want

00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:54,320
there's also groups that are general and

00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:55,880
cover a lot of things are the sea jug is

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,809
more of a general group or I'll cover

00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,850
anything on the JVM the thing with

00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:04,700
general generality is a lot of times

00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:06,140
you'll get different people each meetup

00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,210
depending on what you're presenting on

00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,890
and you don't get a lot of cohesion with

00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:12,409
the people that are coming in you want

00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:14,270
kind of regulars coming in so that you

00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:18,230
can start getting a relationship with

00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:21,230
people otherwise you know mentoring the

00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:23,210
same first person you know 20 times in a

00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:24,919
row is not really that effective you

00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:28,880
want to start building a community where

00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:30,620
the same people show up the other things

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,659
you want people that you can work with

00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:35,090
so meeting with the people running the

00:23:32,659 --> 00:23:37,340
group and figuring out you know what

00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:40,010
they're doing this for and what's

00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:41,090
important to them is very important with

00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,590
figuring out if you're going to get

00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:44,450
heavily involved in user group because

00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:46,280
it does take time it's just like working

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,230
on a project where sometimes you get

00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,390
kind of hooked on it because you're

00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:53,330
you're able to talk to speakers and

00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:56,419
you're able to talk with companies and

00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:58,250
find out what everybody's doing you're

00:23:56,419 --> 00:24:00,169
going to spend a lot of time with people

00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:04,809
if you get involved with them on a board

00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:04,809
or actually in the running of the group

00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:11,990
okay

00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:13,580
so now if you've signed up what are some

00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:15,950
things that are helpful and these are

00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:18,470
kind of tips that that we've found along

00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:20,179
the years of how to run this the C jug

00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:22,549
successfully you know we have about

00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:24,590
twenty five hundred members we've been

00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:26,330
doing it for probably the last five or

00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:28,250
six years

00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:30,500
you know what makes user groups

00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:32,480
successful and what can I do in order to

00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:35,270
get you know the free beer every week

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,750
and to have a group of people that as I

00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:40,610
mentor as we grow can start becoming and

00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:45,170
influencing and doing good things in the

00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:47,000
SF as well the first thing again back to

00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:50,570
getting speakers and one of the things

00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,340
that to think about is think big one of

00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:54,140
the really crazy things when you're

00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,700
thinking about asking someone to speak

00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,890
is we usually think in terms of it's

00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:01,040
like man really asking this person to do

00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:04,070
a huge favor for me the big secret about

00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,870
speakers is they like to do this they

00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:09,170
like to come up in front of people and

00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:12,620
talk especially user groups because if

00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:15,350
the speaker is writing a book or trying

00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,600
to run a conference or you know they're

00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:20,060
they're trying to do some self-promotion

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,550
for themselves speaking is what gives

00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:26,330
them the opportunity to do that by

00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:28,160
thinking big you're going to bring in

00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:29,660
the or at least give yourself the

00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,820
opportunity to bring in the top-notch

00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:34,370
talent the one thing that we decided

00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:37,400
right off the bat with the C jug is that

00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:38,900
we wanted the content to be the best it

00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,580
possibly could nothing else would really

00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,590
matter as long as we had really good

00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:46,070
content we would all the other things

00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:47,660
would fall into place one of the things

00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:49,640
that happens though if you get too

00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,530
focused on getting the big names is you

00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,900
forget about your local community and

00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:57,620
the goal is to have a good mix of

00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:59,450
speakers so one thing we started doing

00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,670
in order to try to engage other people

00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:04,400
and bring people in our community so

00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:07,070
when we go to conferences we have people

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,440
there that we know right off the bat is

00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:11,450
encouraging whitening talks and getting

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,890
regular members to come up and talk

00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:14,750
about some of the technology they're

00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:17,000
using you know the last project they did

00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:18,650
at work and we found this really

00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,610
effective and not only recruiting new

00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:24,770
members to our to our board but getting

00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:26,870
people more involved in the jug and to

00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:32,150
care about what we're doing in the user

00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:34,460
group so assuming you can find somebody

00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:37,220
to talk the next hardest thing is

00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:39,240
getting the venue for them to talk in

00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,190
and this was was our biggest challenge

00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,690
as it turns out there's a lot of good

00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:44,659
speakers in Chicago that we just didn't

00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:49,470
even know about until we started asking

00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:50,760
and we were lucky for the first couple

00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:52,919
years we were doing this because we had

00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,980
one place that would just give us space

00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:58,649
and pizza and beer and life was good but

00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,720
then their budget dried up and they said

00:26:58,649 --> 00:27:03,480
well we can't really do this for you

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,520
anymore so we were run into a tailspin

00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,200
it's like what do we do we talked to a

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,260
place I said well yeah we can cover you

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:13,409
for next month but the month after that

00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:15,419
yeah we don't know so we kept moving to

00:27:13,409 --> 00:27:18,000
different places and one of the things

00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:20,520
that we discovered was that by moving it

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,909
around as long as you stay in a similar

00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:26,460
proximity is a really healthy thing for

00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:28,260
your community because what we pitch now

00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,539
to our members is if you're looking for

00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:32,460
a job you're looking to understand you

00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:35,490
know what kind of work is going around

00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:37,230
in the Chicago area you just have to

00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:39,480
come to see jugg because we're going to

00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:41,159
keep moving around to all the people and

00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,169
companies that are willing to support

00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,450
the community and provide space for

00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:49,380
people to gather and have these sort of

00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:51,419
activities to happen so really it's this

00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,720
huge win-win that you're looking to

00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:56,520
focus on when you're looking for venues

00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,590
you get to offer and say well company

00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,870
you're going to have developers coming

00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:02,520
in and you're going to be able to

00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:04,169
interact with your development team

00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,909
that's the one thing I tell them is make

00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:08,340
sure your development team is coming to

00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:09,630
the meetup because you just don't want

00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,220
your recruiter standing up there and

00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,450
saying how great the company is because

00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,850
we all know that we can trust the

00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:16,590
recruiters right they're not going to

00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,750
give us an overly rosy picture of the

00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:21,270
company but if you have your developers

00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:23,010
there and you have conversations like

00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:24,750
meaningful conversations with them and

00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:27,270
say I can see myself working with this

00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:29,460
person it turns out it's very effective

00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:31,350
and as it turns out your membership is

00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,360
also looking for jobs a lot you know we

00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:36,299
in technology we change jobs all the

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,799
time so it's good to have a you know a

00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:43,590
ways for people to make those

00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:48,960
connections and then growing your

00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:50,880
membership so one of the things that we

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,289
learn so you once you get the venue and

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,820
the speaker thing worked out you you

00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:55,669
basic

00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:57,769
we achieve the basic Maslov order of

00:28:55,669 --> 00:29:00,139
needs so you have speakers you have

00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:02,059
venue you have beer and pizza so like

00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:03,889
from a sustainability perspective it's

00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:07,850
all you do is that your your at least

00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:10,730
going to live but once you're able to do

00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:12,380
that frequently you can achieve like

00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:15,320
much higher levels where you get to have

00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:19,700
more fun and one of the things that you

00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:21,950
can do is get more involved so we

00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,330
started expanding our topic list to

00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:25,789
start covering like alternative

00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:27,919
languages we started covering things

00:29:25,789 --> 00:29:31,309
that maybe weren't even technology

00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:36,559
topics necessarily but we're interests

00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:37,940
of our of our community and what this

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,230
did is that allowed us to start

00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,940
partnering with other groups so if we

00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,860
did something on Scala's Chicago has got

00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,299
a scholar user group we would partner

00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,559
with the scholar user group and then we

00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:48,710
got to meet all the leaders in the

00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:50,750
scholar user group the PI expanded for

00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:52,519
us again even with the fragmentation of

00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,960
the the develop of the user group

00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:55,730
communities we were able to kind of

00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:58,850
bridge that and partner with other user

00:29:55,730 --> 00:30:01,399
groups the other thing we did and this

00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:03,860
is this is Apache but we did get

00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:05,389
involved in the JCP so don't boo me off

00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:07,850
the stage right now I know there's

00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:11,120
issues with Apache and the JCP it's not

00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:13,519
an open process but as a user group

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,549
getting involved in that process did

00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:18,919
give our developers a voice in what they

00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:22,039
wanted or at least a way for us to

00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:24,019
communicate back to the JCP process of

00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:27,710
what was happening with what our

00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:30,200
developers wanted with Java we also

00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:33,230
started working in adopting jsr which

00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,299
allowed you know us to get involved in

00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:37,549
some of the jsr spec writing processes

00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:40,340
and provide feedback on those things so

00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:42,889
you know you can just like Apache in

00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:44,929
many ways you know we don't always we

00:30:42,889 --> 00:30:47,629
don't dictate what people should and

00:30:44,929 --> 00:30:49,549
shouldn't do we just kind of provide you

00:30:47,629 --> 00:30:51,740
know the basic layout and say okay

00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:53,120
here's here's the basic things that you

00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:56,600
guys can take this where you want to go

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,960
with it all right

00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,740
and finally encouraging open source

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,289
contributions so once you're getting

00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:06,320
involved you have meetings you have you

00:31:03,289 --> 00:31:08,649
have speakers the next step is

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:12,769
let's try to get people building stuff

00:31:08,649 --> 00:31:14,690
so what we found is a couple of things

00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:17,120
that we'll do so holding hack nights

00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:19,909
where people are not just listening to

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,559
speakers but actually building things

00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:24,080
with their hands and these can be Apache

00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:26,269
projects you know one one thing we did

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,039
last year was we did a hackathon with on

00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:30,679
Apache groovy it was like let's welcome

00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:32,000
groovy to the ASF they're new let's

00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:36,080
bring them in and this could be done for

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,179
any incubator project but the first time

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,279
we did something like this we found it

00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:42,649
was it was difficult to figure out what

00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:43,909
people should be working on because some

00:31:42,649 --> 00:31:47,269
people were just like wow I'm just

00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:49,250
learning groovy so going through and

00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:50,720
curating some of the jurors and this is

00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:53,690
actually something I've heard in a

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,330
number of talks so far but it really

00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:58,460
does work going through a JIRA before

00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:00,860
you have the half night and saying you

00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:03,679
know these are three four five jurors

00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:06,500
that we think even if you're fairly

00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,559
junior we might be able to get a pull

00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,669
request or a patch out in an evening

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,230
makes people feel really good about

00:32:10,669 --> 00:32:14,090
themselves and again it's that feeling

00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,559
that we're trying to propagate so that

00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:17,779
people are willing to make that next

00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:20,419
step and say alright I'm going to try to

00:32:17,779 --> 00:32:23,809
do this more regularly or maybe on my

00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:25,279
own without people around another thing

00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:27,679
we've tried just this year is holding

00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:31,429
office hours so these are hours where we

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:33,830
set aside and people can come to us and

00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:35,330
we'll have it'll just be open

00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:38,720
conversation you can bring your project

00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:41,389
in I'm trying to learn spring boots or

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,299
I'm trying to make this work in a

00:32:41,389 --> 00:32:46,519
passion camel and it's not working and

00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:48,320
it's not free consulting there's really

00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:50,360
a limit to what you know you can get

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,950
done but it's only an evening right and

00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:55,519
it's just however many people show up

00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:57,320
it's a conversation and what I'd like to

00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,570
see this evolve into is almost like some

00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,580
pairing where people bring in their

00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:03,649
projects and we set aside the JIRA's

00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:05,240
even just for the office hours and do

00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:08,149
some hacking there for people to learn

00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,100
the language the other thing is having

00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:11,870
talks on open-source again covering some

00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:16,909
of the things that people just don't

00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:19,160
know by default like you know what is my

00:33:16,909 --> 00:33:20,540
responsibility when I'm a committer

00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,820
is extremely useful what are the

00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:26,300
differences between joining one

00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:29,210
foundation like the ASF or joining Cloud

00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:31,250
Foundry or the Eclipse Foundation I did

00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:32,990
a talk earlier this year with with one

00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:35,090
of my friends Michael Mennella who works

00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:37,310
at pivotal and he talked about being a

00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:39,140
spring committer and how that works

00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:41,780
versus you know what it would be like

00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:44,150
working in the ASF and I kind of took

00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:46,580
the ASF perspective on things you know

00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:47,870
and there are differences that can be

00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,150
important if you're looking to get

00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:51,860
involved in it come and so they don't

00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,690
have to be technical you know that the

00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:55,880
talks just should cover you know hey I'm

00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:58,820
interested what would what do I need to

00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:01,460
know before I get involved and then

00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:03,140
finally encouraging other people to give

00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,910
talks again the Lightning talks and

00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:08,780
being in and putting them in a position

00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:11,540
where they take that next step to learn

00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:13,520
the software well enough to give a talk

00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:19,629
on it because this is actually what got

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:22,159
me into user groups and Apache so

00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:25,100
getting an open-source is a journey and

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:28,460
mine started about 5 years ago being

00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:30,620
encouraged to get it into a talk it was

00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:32,330
on Apache slang and I thought I knew

00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,500
something about this open-source project

00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,700
because I'd worked with it for a few

00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,760
years but when I was trying to condense

00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:40,760
it into a talk I ended up finding oh

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,169
wait there's a bug in this release or

00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,940
there was there something that didn't

00:34:42,169 --> 00:34:46,760
work in my talk the way I expected it to

00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:49,879
and it started you know oh well maybe I

00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,919
should suffer juror for this and the

00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:56,780
funniest thing is the timing of this

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:58,970
talk was exactly five years ago today so

00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:01,360
it's kind of ironic being here and

00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:03,380
giving this talk five years after I

00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,700
started getting brought into this

00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:07,160
because there's another really

00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:09,530
significant thing that happened that day

00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,570
and if you can think of all the worst

00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:13,100
possible things they're not worse but

00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:16,400
interesting things that can happen when

00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:18,410
you're giving a talk this happened for

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:24,560
me so it's my five-year-old birthday

00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:28,100
today and I got a call during the or

00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,960
well I got texted during my talk about

00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,640
my wife going to the hospital for him

00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,960
now of course it was covered up because

00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:38,990
my text messages were full

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:42,020
all but I went off and gave my talk at a

00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:45,109
kid and then started continuing to think

00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:47,180
about open-source so but this is really

00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:48,740
why we do this right we have the ability

00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:51,619
to create software that's going to be

00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:54,050
used for a very very very long time and

00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:55,820
even if it dies and you know the

00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:58,010
processes and the things we have in

00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,530
place are important so being able to

00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:03,230
bring people in to do the work and to

00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:05,570
have them understand what the value add

00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:10,580
is for them to do this for their career

00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:13,760
is really critical so this is me these

00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:15,830
are some links to my podcasts does

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,900
anybody wondering so you guys did math

00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:20,060
right so there's three of them there I

00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,740
just had one last month so is anybody

00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:25,040
like wait a minute

00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:26,720
you have four kids and you're involved

00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,619
in a user group and you contribute to

00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,210
open source and how do you do that so I

00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:34,310
kind of put this together because there

00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:36,050
there's some things that are really

00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:37,250
important if you're a busy person and

00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:42,140
you want to get involved in these things

00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:44,390
so this is yeah so how do you run a user

00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:47,540
group and get involved go to and go to

00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:49,400
Apache con a month and a half later so

00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,869
basically I looked at it like a load

00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,480
test so this is what it looks like right

00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:55,130
now so this is my wife over here she's

00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,770
got all four of them I get to go to

00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:59,720
Apache Con and so far this is working

00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:02,650
very well she's a little bit overloaded

00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:06,730
but in order to make this work long-term

00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:10,280
this is what happens after apache Khan

00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:11,960
I'm not sure if I'm completely ready for

00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,450
the load over here I might have to solve

00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,859
some device mapping issues but she gets

00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:17,720
to go away with her sister after the

00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:20,210
after this so really the compromise

00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,680
thing if you have a significant other

00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:25,280
that's like why are you doing all of

00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:28,880
these things this is generally one way

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,380
that you can make it work so just keep

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,970
that in mind if you're if you're ever

00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:36,500
trying to sell these things to your wife

00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:38,720
or husband to try to balance them out a

00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:42,530
little bit and then you could do these

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,880
things longer-term so that's all I got

00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:45,470
and there should be some time for

00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,740
questions if you guys want to have asked

00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:48,780
any questions I was

00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:50,820
kind of hoping if anybody here is

00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,470
running a user group and they have

00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,730
things that they want to talk about

00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,590
things that are working things that

00:37:53,730 --> 00:38:00,950
aren't working would love to have that

00:37:55,590 --> 00:38:00,950
discussion yes

00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:16,360
yeah so the question is you have a

00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:19,150
thousands of members how many people

00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:22,690
actually end up coming to the meetups so

00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:27,670
it varies per topic and what we've found

00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:30,400
is the longer that we've been around the

00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:32,770
worse the no-show rate actually got and

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,040
we also record everything so that also

00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:37,540
has made the no-show rate go up but

00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,270
what's really interesting is it's

00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:42,010
extremely consistent is we're always at

00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:44,560
right about fifty percent so if we get

00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:47,890
you know our typical meetup is between

00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:50,020
forty and eighty people somewhere in

00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:52,480
that range so if we get eighty signups

00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:54,430
we know we're like right about the forty

00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,230
mark so if you're if you're trying to

00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:58,990
work with a vendor and say well how much

00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:01,270
pizza and beer do we need we just say

00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:01,870
well just cut it in half and we should

00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,060
be fine

00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:06,070
it's one of those things that's held now

00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:08,050
for about two and a half years so it's

00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:10,360
almost like we tried like making people

00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:13,300
feel guilty for not showing up and it

00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:15,040
doesn't work the only time it really

00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:17,800
becomes an issue is if we do have hard

00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,000
limits and we need to make sure that if

00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,890
people aren't going to show up they do

00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,810
register to make room for people that

00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:24,310
are actually going to show up then we'll

00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:28,450
we'll do a little guilt trip ting but

00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:30,430
for the most part where we're right at

00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:31,680
that 50 percent show rate it's a good

00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:33,730
question though

00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,970
but when you're just starting out and

00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:39,640
it's sometimes like 70 percent if you

00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:45,960
know everybody but that eventually goes

00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:45,960
away any other questions

00:39:53,470 --> 00:40:02,349
okay well thank you very much

00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:02,349
