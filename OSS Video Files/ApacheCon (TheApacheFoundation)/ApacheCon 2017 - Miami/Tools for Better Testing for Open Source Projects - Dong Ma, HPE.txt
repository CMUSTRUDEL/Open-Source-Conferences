	Tools for Better Testing for Open Source Projects - Dong Ma, HPE

Quality is most important for Open Source projects, but a lot of Open Source projects do not put much focus on testing upstream. There are real benefits to having a dedicated QA effort on an Open Source project. This talk will use OpenStack as an example to introduce the approach and tooling used by OpenStack Community for testing, and to explore how an Open Source project do QA in upstream, how open source projects can use tooling to improve their QA process and the potential benefits it can provide.
