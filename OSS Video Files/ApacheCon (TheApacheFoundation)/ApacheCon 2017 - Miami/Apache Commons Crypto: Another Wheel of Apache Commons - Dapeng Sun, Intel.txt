	Apache Commons Crypto: Another Wheel of Apache Commons - Dapeng Sun, Intel

Apache Commons Crypto is a cross-platform cryptographic library optimized with AES-NI and hardware random number generator. With the benefits of hardware acceleration and the optimized native implementation, this library outperformed JCE by an order of magnitude. Java developers can use this handy library to get strong and high performance AES encryption/decryption. This presentation will introduce the origin of Apache Commons CRYPTO, the recent improvements in commons crypto community, how CRYPTO accelerates data encryption, and the future plan of Apache Commons Crypto.
