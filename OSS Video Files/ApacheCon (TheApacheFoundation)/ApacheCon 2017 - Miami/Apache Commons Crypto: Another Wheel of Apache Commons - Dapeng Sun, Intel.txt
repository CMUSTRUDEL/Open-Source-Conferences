Description: 
	Apache Commons Crypto: Another Wheel of Apache Commons - Dapeng Sun, Intel

Apache Commons Crypto is a cross-platform cryptographic library optimized with AES-NI and hardware random number generator. With the benefits of hardware acceleration and the optimized native implementation, this library outperformed JCE by an order of magnitude. Java developers can use this handy library to get strong and high performance AES encryption/decryption. This presentation will introduce the origin of Apache Commons CRYPTO, the recent improvements in commons crypto community, how CRYPTO accelerates data encryption, and the future plan of Apache Commons Crypto.

hello thank you all for they're here and

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,429
I'm I'm very glad to have this

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,219
opportunity to give a talk at a party

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,719
conference in North America and today I

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,780
will people talk about the Apache

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:25,890
Commons capital another view of Apache

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:29,099
comas okay right okay

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:32,940
my name is dawn and I'm a commuter of

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:36,210
Apache Commons Crito and I'm also a GMC

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,910
member of Apache century and I'm focus

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,370
on bigger data and a security under

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,920
jenna is my colleague and he contributed

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,590
many improvements on public comments

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,989
collaborative an apache pig and he also

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,899
contributed some improvements on open

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:55,050
JDK and there is a little pity that she

00:00:51,899 --> 00:01:02,699
not couldn't come here so I will in a

00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:06,090
gated talk about myself ok before I hear

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:09,450
the the agenda of this talk be first of

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:14,630
all before we discuss crypto it's better

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:19,049
to take a look at a cryptographic and

00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:21,900
then we'll talk about the it's a common

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:25,740
scribble and write either they created

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:29,100
such a library and after that I will try

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,930
to give you a bit a deeper and we will

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,680
talk about talk about the performance

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:42,899
secret and lastly I will show you some

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:45,960
AP I'll show you how commence crypto is

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:49,680
secure even bigger data and I also show

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,509
you some API examples and how questions

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:57,829
are how many of you are similar biz

00:01:51,509 --> 00:02:01,469
getting under cryptographic ok ok no ok

00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:05,810
ok so don't know where I will give a

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:09,030
brief news videos about a cryptographic

00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:11,730
ok kuvvatov graphic is a bigger dog cave

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,599
is a bigger topic so I'm not going to

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,489
cover all the first eight

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,650
lecture only recover some critical

00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:21,760
primer to another level

00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:25,269
I got algorithms they can be classified

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,799
as the Tholian types symmetric

00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:30,670
encryption is the user for

00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:35,139
confidentiality des travaux DEA's

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:37,950
article AES popular symmetrical

00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:41,079
algorithms and the asymmetrical

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:46,060
encryption is used for authentication

00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:50,799
and K distinct such as I see and give

00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:55,060
Hellman and the ECC and so on and the

00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:58,030
hussy algorithm is used for a provider

00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:01,030
or digital fingerprint for message in

00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:05,079
integrity and authenticated encryption

00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:06,489
is a fundamental of war criminal primary

00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:08,469
it is a convention of the

00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:12,189
confidentiality and the integrity and

00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:16,900
then random number generator and is the

00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:22,810
useful or vote and generator the key and

00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:25,180
IV for the corridor graphic under it has

00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:29,859
the Zulu number generator and children

00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:32,169
to random number generator and before we

00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:35,579
talk about that low-level

00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:42,430
algorithms there is a concept mode of

00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:44,500
operations and Interpol or the SAP out

00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:49,359
of food to avoid the creating an

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:52,150
integral in input data and there are

00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:56,310
some more like a 680 our mode and the

00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:56,310
CBC mode and design mode

00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:08,480
okay let's go back to what was its

00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:10,940
Apogee comments critical and this is a

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,750
high-performance gamma cryptographic a

00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:20,180
library which is optimized by a inhale

00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:24,590
18 tau is an technology and it Maps

00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:28,970
organize our RJ engine and it is a high

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:33,710
performance and we yield to the GN i of

00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:42,020
the between Java and the native I know

00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:46,030
they also support DNA and ok ok here is

00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:46,030
the history of a common scripts of and

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,950
inherited a talking box debated a batik

00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,050
huggable community to improve the

00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:58,100
proverb to improve the performance of

00:04:54,050 --> 00:05:01,330
HDFS transparent education first is

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:04,340
called HDFS the Carib etre hood ik and

00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:06,380
which is the base layer in now ASL

00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:09,260
technology and the organizer codec and

00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:14,650
the ADA could improve the performance by

00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:17,140
17 times over and they say the

00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:21,710
significant performance improvement and

00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:25,870
later I will also give a talk about her

00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:25,870
inhale a a span and technology

00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:36,290
okay repeal of it we found other

00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:39,350
projects are also higher in conclusion

00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:43,240
requirements such as the spark Asia base

00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:46,040
so we create elaborate to make chimera

00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:51,380
project we want to the lab under the

00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:54,650
laboratory remembers the library to

00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:58,870
along other Big Data projects to easily

00:05:54,650 --> 00:06:02,450
contributed the other ones or inhale

00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:04,810
areas and hydrology and this project

00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:07,940
will handle the effects that of the

00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:10,930
companion of all new table native

00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,930
library of Linux

00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:24,010
okay and Rosanna for some reason they

00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:26,860
found an Apache Commons grip so Lipan

00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:31,210
Apache Commons community would be the

00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:34,830
best place to host this project and also

00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:37,330
many GMC and the commuters from ammaji

00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:40,720
Commons the community helped improve

00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:43,300
this project and shatter the code the

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:50,980
reciter documentation cause value under

00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:53,260
the release many stands for and look at

00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:56,020
let's look at the features of AB common

00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:59,980
script oh and it provides low level

00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:02,620
algorithms currently only AES right now

00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:05,680
and you can use data to encrypt your

00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:09,850
data and imply your own crazy grata

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:14,370
proposals and it also provided streaming

00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:17,800
stream API you can use the high level

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:22,090
API to include and decrypt your data

00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:28,060
from the dream and the channel and we

00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:31,060
also provide a random API at our it has

00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:35,430
a true random number generator

00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,430
they say the accellerated by hardware

00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:48,370
okay your may have Equestria if they are

00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:51,820
really high which is a year and then

00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:54,970
ready the very creator another view key

00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:59,740
say you support a lot of rhythms and it

00:07:54,970 --> 00:08:02,140
is a tae is also very powerful so I will

00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:13,360
give a talk about the background under

00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:14,340
the motivation of our project okay cut

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,940
cut

00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:22,180
currently some some Java cryptographic

00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:25,860
support photos Saturdays also and using

00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:30,820
infection diseases low level algorithms

00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:34,240
3d as our CFO etc and every note that

00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:39,160
Hadoop and the sparkle user our own very

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:42,460
big data and into the low level

00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:46,150
algorithm of a week and the data will

00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:48,700
enable to attack and they were small the

00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,740
performance of this is the pollak they

00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,860
need to take a security and the

00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:59,220
performance into account JJ is

00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:59,220
incredible incredible for PGI others

00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:12,120
okay then which algorithms pseudo rate

00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:18,720
rules

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:22,230
PS is insecure and broken and crippled

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,350
Diaz is too slow and article is a

00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:29,010
well-known for edges the beta and higher

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:32,910
work recently na is a considered to to

00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:34,860
be insecure ADA was prohibited by RFC

00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:37,170
and both Microsoft and modular

00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:43,080
recommended developer desert disabled

00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:49,520
impossible so when it had come to

00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:49,520
security the winner is undoubtedly a yes

00:09:55,010 --> 00:10:02,460
yes is secure and it considered the

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,130
industry standard and however the

00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,020
problem is that of the performance of a

00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:10,530
s engineer is not good enough for

00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:13,290
political users conformance that's the

00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:22,620
matter here okay let's look at the

00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:25,110
benchmark numbers okay here is the

00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:28,530
throughput of those symmetrical

00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:32,240
encryption algorithms from this chat a

00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:35,880
vacancy data Triple DES is very slow and

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,280
rc4 vitiated the same merciful is speed

00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:44,280
as a repeater faster than a yes into

00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:47,130
decade under they can clearly see that

00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:51,780
the performance of AES in common script

00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:55,170
oh it's Austin Austin Austin D and it

00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:58,680
can modern or gigabytes per second it

00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:01,220
can be about four times faster than

00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,220
article

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,690
okay let's look at the authenticated

00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:17,050
incubation and now the ecosystem is

00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:21,900
almost using a shoemaker Sheila and a

00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:25,260
snack md5 and AES VCR mode is secure

00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:29,350
it was designed for high performance and

00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:33,310
however nobody even to your date because

00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:36,220
it is noticeable in JDK 7 and the

00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:40,720
performance indicator is Angelica it is

00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:44,620
also and it'll improve in GD cleaner but

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:48,760
it is still not good enough we can

00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:52,210
clearly see that the comments crypto AES

00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:57,040
GCM mode is very fast about a six times

00:11:52,210 --> 00:12:01,350
faster than our c4h microwatt close to

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,350
one gigabyte per second

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:19,089
okay in some case let's say application

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:23,260
generators do number key and worsen

00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:25,269
later to calendar and targeter can get

00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:30,279
the key by observing the sequence of

00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:32,560
output and therefore to do number

00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:35,529
generators are considered to be insecure

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:40,209
and the random class indicated the

00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:42,940
pseudo number and generator and it is

00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:47,529
insecure the secure random Angelica is

00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:50,800
strong and crivit capital random in

00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:55,300
common scribble library its ordinal

00:12:50,800 --> 00:13:00,630
number random number generator and both

00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:04,029
of them are wrong and from the

00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:06,880
formidable performance level common

00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:10,000
scripts alleges a winner and we can see

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:14,490
that a comment great battle comments

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:18,269
Kabuto is about 13 times of absurd and

00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,269
secure random of Java

00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:34,510
okay here comes concluded Commerce grip

00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:37,320
so it is secure and the path and it's a

00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,320
better alternative

00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:56,279
okay and if you're using comments crypto

00:13:52,350 --> 00:14:00,360
to secure data and the non-performance

00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:09,270
botnik animal and you may ask what would

00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:11,690
make a comment cravat also fact okay

00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:15,900
here it's the performance secret and

00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:19,650
security of an aes technology then i'm

00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:22,589
is the new instruction and there are a

00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:26,220
few instructions and let's take a while

00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:30,300
for the instructions AF NC for example

00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:33,779
the depiction document says the AES

00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:36,450
algorithm how about a 10 to 40 rounds

00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:40,770
and each round consists of several

00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:44,490
processing steps and the thesis tabs are

00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:47,640
complex and time-consuming and the

00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:50,910
riskiness i only a single instruction

00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:53,520
and the superior to audit staff or you

00:14:50,910 --> 00:15:00,830
it'll improve the performance remarkably

00:14:53,520 --> 00:15:08,580
and and the AES is also enabled in GM

00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:12,050
and the sincerity dk8 updater 45 so why

00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:16,500
it's a common script so chill factor

00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:19,910
then dedicate and still five to seven

00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,910
times faster than jeddak a

00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:30,330
okay here comes the security to peppa

00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:33,390
lion and instruction level parallelism

00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:36,690
and the various russian title seven

00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:40,350
superior clock cycles let's look at the

00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:42,690
upper figure under the destination

00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:46,140
rejecter in two instructions are the

00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:48,690
same and the data dependency exists and

00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:52,350
the second instruction how to data about

00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:55,830
a southern city or servant of your clock

00:15:52,350 --> 00:16:00,240
cycles until the first instruction have

00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:03,150
finished and if we break down a vapor

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,120
equal the data dependency but the Logar

00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:09,240
finger shows the destination reject her

00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,950
are different than the then all the

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,550
instructions can be is killed in

00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,550
parallel

00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:41,100
okay and there there are other three of

00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:45,860
the other reasons why common Scrivener

00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:50,040
is the factor than dedicate and in GDK

00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:53,160
ATS is a novel organizer and the openers

00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:56,400
are was a lot of tricky circles and the

00:16:53,160 --> 00:17:06,329
you may ask already not open mind of all

00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:09,660
minimize the JVM and PMO is becoming a

00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:11,520
factor in GT cleaner yeah because you

00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:15,449
can see the hardware acceleration is

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,850
enabled in gdk9 and we also contributed

00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:20,060
to patch and the patch is the

00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:23,730
contributed by my colleague agenda and

00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:27,150
and apparel item optimization into jelly

00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:29,340
Evangelina under the performance of AES

00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:33,120
the CBC and the CTR mode it's close to

00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:35,850
organizer or no but the panel's is cut

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:39,020
not very together in the last section

00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:42,450
and we need we need to reserve your

00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:48,180
initial visit to adopt the program in

00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:50,610
our software production yeah so we only

00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,440
make data organized it's better to use a

00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:55,010
common square root or under which is

00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,010
organized

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:07,190
okay here is our work of a common

00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:14,600
squirrel and in how is Anna technology

00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:17,380
and the under the particular Hydra for

00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:20,770
security security and the performance

00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:25,130
had to plan this tobacco users or

00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:29,210
counterweighted conveyed cultivated to

00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:34,760
use a common scribble and a yes i

00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:39,770
technology and they this work are

00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:41,840
related at work and the first and the

00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:51,980
second

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:54,890
it's about her the spock and the buffer

00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:57,860
and the RPC against Ibaka is the using

00:18:54,890 --> 00:19:01,610
common square battle to encrypt the data

00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:06,790
from a wider attacked and it'll also

00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:09,980
bring a lot of performance King and the

00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:13,820
affiliate is encrypt the partner being

00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:17,620
question is also used in how a San

00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:28,040
Patrignano G Rishi is booing about her

00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:31,370
17 times the performance and and the X

00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,990
base in each place they improve such

00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,570
barrier in the table and the column plan

00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:38,900
may include version this is a common

00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:42,380
square battle and it show some house

00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:46,400
also greater performance gain in the

00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:50,380
benchmark and we also improve the RPC

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:54,610
inhibition of extra base and the

00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:57,970
performance is also very good and

00:19:54,610 --> 00:20:02,330
currently of this hill higher to de-rank

00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:03,860
developer mentor Vera is optimizing the

00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:06,860
hard work obviously incubation

00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:10,450
performance it's something like her the

00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:14,379
worker unity base and

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:18,970
and they are also in working on the JIRA

00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:29,169
of all replacing hard work critical

00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:33,879
Danica with Apache Commons crippled ok

00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:37,059
let's see some more API demos and here

00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:40,989
it's the edge item host and the upper

00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:48,210
sample is the random number that random

00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:48,210
can occur it is similar to dedicate and

00:20:48,720 --> 00:21:02,429
your secretary to get an instance and

00:20:52,350 --> 00:21:02,429
gasta field IV another p and under under

00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:11,950
to safer to soft ever it seems it seemed

00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:16,679
and use the secretary to get several

00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:22,539
instance and under passive mode of

00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:31,149
automotive yes under i you need a server

00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:34,409
I need to find one close the cipher ok

00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:39,090
here is a example for decommission

00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:43,450
diversion it's the almost same under

00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:46,059
adjuster site two different mode and

00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:48,220
this is a deeper several several

00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:50,440
separate the measure the force average

00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:55,119
the same as as the mode it's a different

00:21:50,440 --> 00:22:01,239
set for mode eco mode and also in the

00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:05,429
key an IV we must include the cipher

00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:05,429
when they finish the incubation

00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:23,280
okay here is the stream sample and it

00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:26,140
ate all those and we quick we can see a

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:31,780
stream API can secure this room and

00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:34,120
channel data and a stream is based on

00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:42,159
the Zephyr separate the bass sound the

00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:47,020
mode and the current Lee's our Hadoop

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:53,950
are hadoo are using the back-to-back are

00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:59,740
using this okay and here it's the

00:22:53,950 --> 00:23:04,690
leaders of all of our project and under

00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:07,780
featured work currently the fertile

00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:11,830
release the first release in in the

00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:15,820
released and currently CBC and secure

00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:18,820
mode it is supported and she said mode

00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:24,850
will be released the unites the release

00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:29,549
and we were also planning to cover model

00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:34,600
forces such as the supposed asymmetric

00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:40,510
key algorithms such as as RSA and Sita

00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:43,570
and and if you are interested in

00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:46,390
contributing to commerce crypto and echo

00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:50,140
out our you can create a Keira and

00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:53,140
creative request uncle Yabba and you can

00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:59,919
also send a email either the malice of

00:23:53,140 --> 00:24:05,909
Abijah comments okay okay it's a little

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,909
