	Diversity, For Those Playing Life on Easy - Nick Burch, Apache Software Foundation

Diversity and inclusion are becoming hot topics within our open source communities and industry, but for those of us ""playing life on easy"", the subject and impact can be harder to ""get"".

Like many people who used to play life on easy, I've had some blind spots around diversity and inclusion. I only discovered these through working on projects, communities and support at the ASF, and by moving to a new country!

Now it is my mission to help others see the light, learn for themselves, and through that build better open source communities. I'll be sharing what I learnt, giving resources, and specific takeaway actions.

okay welcome everyone I think I've got

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:12,410
my breath back from the mad dash for a

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,410
VGA adapter so I think we're good to go

00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:21,930
right so diversity when playing life on

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:26,369
easy and there's a few women in the room

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:29,880
this talk isn't really aimed at you this

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:31,800
is aimed at people who are not yet far

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,770
enough down the road of understanding

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,690
diversity to realize why they maybe need

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,390
to hear a diver to talk from someone who

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,149
doesn't look like them please do not be

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,309
scared if you look like me this is about

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,850
the journey that I have taken and I'm

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:49,289
hoping to drag a lot of you along on the

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,360
understanding of how it can help your

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:55,820
community how it can help yourself as a

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,820
person and why this stuff really matters

00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:04,379
so fleeing life then you one read this

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:08,729
blog post about the analogy of life as a

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:14,580
computer game lots of shaking of the

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:17,880
heads okay so the idea of this post and

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,400
this analogy is that it is perfectly

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:25,110
possible to play a computer game on easy

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:28,080
and still die player community game on

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:32,009
easy not complete the level not kill the

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:35,750
bad guys not solve the puzzle equally

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:40,170
you can play a computer game on hard and

00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:42,680
still a sit still win everything this is

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,630
not saying that playing life on easy

00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,220
means that you automatically win not

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,320
saying that playing life on hard means

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,079
that you can't win it's just saying that

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,720
for different people you may find that

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,119
you have certain advantages certain

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,210
disadvantages that crop up it can still

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,930
be really hard you can still fail you

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:06,090
can still win but we're not necessarily

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,869
all in it together and it's not

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:12,150
necessarily obvious for those those of

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,260
you who grew up playing doom I don't

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,500
know if anyone remember what happened on

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,640
the

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,290
from difficulty levels you'd start off

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,210
and there's a monster you like wow this

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,470
is really hard and then you've put it up

00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,720
to nightmare and you'd start off and

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,510
there's a hundred monsters they're still

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,710
monsters to kill but unless you pushed

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,350
up that difficulty that we didn't

00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:32,130
necessarily notice that it was there

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:34,800
were ways for it to be harder it has

00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:38,100
been suggested that being a straight

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,200
white male guy especially from a

00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,530
middle-class background especially with

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,620
a fairly well-paying tech job is playing

00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:49,200
life on easy we can still fail we can

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,239
still mess up great many of us do a

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,970
great many of us struggle but that's not

00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,739
to say that other people find it just

00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:00,060
that easy most other people find it a

00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:03,959
bit harder so I'm going to try and cover

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:07,800
today is some of the ways that I have

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,989
inadvertently or deliberately pushed up

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,709
the difficulty setting for myself for a

00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:15,600
short while things that I've found that

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:17,880
have made my team's work better my

00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,410
projects work better some of the

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,150
mistakes I've made you can all laugh

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:24,180
along with some of the things that I've

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,890
done and hopefully give you some

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:30,510
pointers on things you might want to

00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:37,620
look into more so first one pretty

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:40,860
obvious one time zones so we're here in

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,790
the States so now how many people here

00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,590
have tried working with a team in India

00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:50,970
okay anyone tried working with a team in

00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:53,000
Australia okay have you tried to get

00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,110
support from them on a Friday and

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,110
they're at the beach because it's

00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,760
Saturday with the Australians if you're

00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,230
working with Indians you like hey it's

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,130
lunchtime weren't they responding to my

00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:07,700
to my emails well then they've gone home

00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:09,959
if you're on an open-source project

00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,610
especially one that the ASF we're all

00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,380
volunteers you've got to be aware of the

00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,239
fact that different people are going to

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,040
be working different times it may be a

00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,720
public holiday in another country it may

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,570
be someone who's only volunteering and

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,330
you're working on their off hours so you

00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:26,510
need to be be sensitive to different

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,780
times if you're working with anyone what

00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:32,360
teams in the Middle East UAE anything

00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:36,890
like that okay they have a different

00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,150
weekend there are there are all these

00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,130
different things that can go on that

00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,690
might mean that when you think someone

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,820
is being lazy because they're not

00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,470
responding your email it's not that

00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:50,570
they're being lazy it's that you just

00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:52,130
haven't thought through okay so if if if

00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:54,950
you're working with people on new

00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:58,550
project who are volunteers they are not

00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:01,100
going to respond during office hours if

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:03,380
you are working as a volunteer and most

00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,150
of the people on your project are paid

00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,400
they're probably not going to respond on

00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,170
a Sunday afternoon you just need to

00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,280
think about what's going on and then

00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,290
make sure that when you're designing

00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,660
your communication systems you're

00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,490
inclusive of that if you are requiring

00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:20,030
everyone to be stood around one single

00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:22,040
water cooler one single office desk for

00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:24,830
a stand up that is going to be very very

00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,900
exclusionary to other people equally if

00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,900
you're doing everything online on a

00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,530
slack on an IRC at one specific point in

00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:37,730
time in the day if you're doing it on a

00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:40,040
Friday afternoon US Pacific time you're

00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:43,400
probably only going to get volunteers

00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,630
from Australia joining because they're

00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,520
the ones who are now on their Saturday

00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,380
morning and can join in but most of the

00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,940
rest of the world is going to be doing

00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,480
other things going to be asleep so don't

00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:55,400
just assume that hey we took our team

00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,380
stand up and instead of it being all

00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,000
around the room we moved a table slack

00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,980
so suddenly we're all welcoming and

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,340
volunteers from all around the world but

00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:07,730
that's still not solved it mailing lists

00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:09,320
and waiting a long time are tedious but

00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:12,080
in many ways they can be the best thing

00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,450
or you just have to shift you'll stand

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,190
up around the world take it in turns to

00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:20,660
be the one that's doing it at 3:00 in

00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:23,770
the morning languages

00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:27,850
another challenge here

00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:32,540
you can be the odd one out if you're

00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:34,550
working in another language I'm looking

00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,880
around the room I'm guessing most people

00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,260
here speak English as a first language

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:43,370
anyone here speak English as a second

00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:45,610
language okay anyone else here speak

00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:49,190
another language as a second language

00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:52,280
we've got any got a few okay if you've

00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:54,380
not tried working in a different

00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,350
language it can be a bit of a shock

00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:59,630
about how hard it is you may think that

00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:03,020
because most people involve decoders and

00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:05,600
motor code is written in English that

00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:10,600
means that everyone involved can speak

00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,600
English it's not the case

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,920
just because you understand how to write

00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,780
the variable doesn't necessarily mean

00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:23,560
you automatically understand the rest of

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:27,770
the language if you can go into a

00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:30,320
Japanese restaurant and point at a soup

00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,880
on the menu and make it appear that does

00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,680
not mean you're fluent in Japanese it

00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,750
means you have a coping mechanism by

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,040
pointing at the pictures it might mean

00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,130
that you have a coping mechanism where

00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,920
you have a book on your desk so it says

00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:45,860
for this concept the letters that you

00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,120
type in are this you may be typing

00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,260
English words in but that doesn't

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,970
automatically mean that you're going to

00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:55,670
understand it okay so another one to be

00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:59,180
aware of is being the odd one out this

00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:01,880
can really affect how you work and how

00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:04,490
you behave so one example few years ago

00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,530
I used to work for a web development

00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:12,230
agency in the UK that mostly worked for

00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:14,660
charities and most of the people in the

00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:18,440
company at the time I joined looks like

00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:21,680
me what guys we have one client who was

00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,240
a very big london-based charity and we

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,070
were working mostly with the IT team

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,490
there on developing piece of software

00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:30,320
for them so went to the first meeting of

00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,360
the client and walked in there oh you're

00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,800
here to see IT and we're like we haven't

00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,800
even introduced ourselves how did you

00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,340
know like yeah I tear the two guys in

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,870
the corner

00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,300
and you just kind of walked in to

00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,490
reminisce like all women all women all

00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,340
women for women all women it's just two

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:48,800
guys in the corner all of the toilets in

00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,600
the building except for one will women's

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,010
toilets so if you want to go to the

00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,020
toilet as a man you have to walk this

00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:56,950
long complicated route yet to find that

00:08:54,020 --> 00:09:00,410
one toilet and you really felt

00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:02,690
self-conscious about the fact that you

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,980
were one of the very few guys there that

00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,470
everything was set up for people other

00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:09,589
than you now if you can try and imagine

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:11,930
turning that on its head for most of the

00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:14,510
women in IT that is their experience

00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,890
every single day they're constantly

00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,410
being reminded of the fact that they're

00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,500
different if you have one person on your

00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:22,520
team who is of a different nationality

00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,589
different first language different

00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,890
ethnicity they're always being reminded

00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:30,920
of that being different

00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:34,880
you've seen the xkcd comic about guys

00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:38,330
and women doing maths anyone seen it I

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,279
should probably put that in but you

00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:42,410
people will sometimes assume that you're

00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:44,630
representative when you are the only

00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:48,710
person of a specific type there and that

00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:51,050
gets quite draining okay another thing

00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:53,120
to be aware of is mistakes no one

00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,630
mentions until you find out and then you

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,970
feel silly

00:09:53,630 --> 00:10:03,740
so in English you say I'd say hi I'm

00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:06,980
Nick in French you say je m'appelle Nick

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:10,790
I am called Nick you don't say just suis

00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:12,680
mnek lots of people apparently a

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:15,170
co-working space I used to go to would

00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,120
find it very quaint and amusing that I

00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:21,950
made this mistake and they let me keep

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,810
making it for three months and then when

00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,070
someone pointed this out our South Cod

00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:27,170
it just must have seemed like this

00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,760
complete idiot and it really not my

00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:31,010
confidence wrap two weeks without two

00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,270
weeks isn't really confident talking to

00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,560
these people again who I've been talking

00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:36,709
to you're making this same obvious

00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:39,020
mistake for months and it just kind of

00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:41,390
caught me off guard you need to be aware

00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:45,740
that people in your team who don't look

00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:47,690
like you you don't speak like you they

00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,220
can be making mistakes they can be

00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:53,509
finding them out and it can be knocking

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:55,610
evidence the reason that the Spanish guy

00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:58,220
in your team is quite quiet in the stand

00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,480
up it's not because he's stupid it's

00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,850
because he's worried about his language

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,160
he's worried about the time that him

00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:07,189
said something and you all laughed the

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:10,970
American in your team and how many

00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:15,500
Americans here have been to the UK okay

00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:17,389
and did you try saying that you'd spilt

00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,680
something on your pants or you'd left

00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:22,819
your pants at home and everyone

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:26,569
sniggered might not notice that okay so

00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:28,519
America these are pants in Britain the

00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:33,290
thing underneath the underwear that's

00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:35,449
the pants you can get a very different

00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:37,100
reaction just from some simple words

00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:40,040
even when we're sharing language showing

00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:42,259
much of a culture and I can tell you

00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,889
that having had American friends make

00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:45,889
that mistake

00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:48,110
they're a lot more cautious for most of

00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:50,060
the rest of that day until they go and

00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:51,589
find that BuzzFeed article about amusing

00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,500
linguistic mistakes between British

00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:56,149
English and American English but the

00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,860
moment the entire room has laughed at

00:11:56,149 --> 00:12:01,279
them they're like I'm just not going to

00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,540
say anything at all be aware that these

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,550
things are going on all the time to

00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,319
other people and it can be affecting

00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:09,970
them can be meaning why they're not join

00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:12,680
your community why they're not speaking

00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:16,279
so I've got cultural and linguistic

00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:18,620
mistakes another thing that can be quite

00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:21,259
tiring mention already is when you are

00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:23,149
taken to be representative when I was a

00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:25,720
co-working space in France they've

00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:29,509
almost like what did the British think

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,069
and I'm like I cannot represent the

00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:31,759
entirety of 60 million people of the

00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:35,660
British Isles

00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:39,230
through myself but everyone's like oh

00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:40,870
Nick you're the Brit what's it like try

00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:46,189
and turn that round imagine something oh

00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:47,839
hey Jenny what do all women think that

00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:50,420
sort of thing can get really tiring just

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,850
being held up as the example and being

00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:55,250
quizzed all the time makes you makes you

00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,329
really feel different you might have

00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,220
thought you're fitting in there like oh

00:12:56,329 --> 00:13:00,589
let's just ask the Brit that thing you

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,759
know now I'm not like them again they

00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:02,690
can knock your confidence it can make

00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:09,649
you unwilling

00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:13,750
talk okay another thing is people act

00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:13,750
differently in different situations

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:19,579
don't know if anyone knows any Spanish

00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:20,600
speakers but you may notice that if you

00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:22,490
have any friends who are Spanish

00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,100
speakers their face often looks

00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:27,649
different when they're talking Spanish

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,930
when they're talking English just the

00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:32,329
kind of mouth movements that get used

00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:33,709
can make them look different if I'm

00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:36,649
hanging out with a load of French people

00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:38,600
I have a tendency to use my arms more

00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:42,939
and also when I'm speaking so this isn't

00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:46,129
necessarily a fair example and if I'm

00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:48,170
hanging out with a lot of older people

00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:50,240
I'll behave differently to hanging out

00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:51,709
with some younger people and I tend to

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,449
do that a little bit self-consciously

00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:55,610
unlike water one else doing how should I

00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:57,500
react but again it's making me think

00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:02,060
differently so if you've got someone in

00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:04,100
your team who is different to the rest

00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,180
of you and you see them there and then

00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,170
you see them go out with some of their

00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,790
friends you'll see them behave

00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,139
differently they're beings they're

00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:11,180
self-consciously adjusting their

00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:12,980
behavior to fit the group so you might

00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,689
say hey it's easy everyone here's the

00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,730
same and even the woman in our team is

00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:18,380
the same it's not necessarily the case

00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,329
they're often changing their behavior

00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:23,329
and that's taking a toll if they're

00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:25,910
thinking about how to behave like all

00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:27,529
the middle-aged white guys they're not

00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,880
necessarily thinking as much about what

00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:31,220
they're going to say in the conversation

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,350
they might be self-consciously adjusting

00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,920
their behavior saying a bit less and

00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:40,370
that's taking its toll there's less time

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:42,860
available for joining the coding right

00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:48,860
nothing is the challenge of being the

00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:54,290
first so if you want the first person of

00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:55,519
your gender nationality language group

00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:57,559
or whatever to be involved in a

00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,879
community it can be quite hard because

00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:04,370
there's no one around to ask so I'm

00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:06,769
going to pick on David here for sex so

00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,990
David is on one of the thing project was

00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:10,459
me and lives in the same town as me so

00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,529
when David wanted to get involved in the

00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:14,389
project it was really easy I was in the

00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:15,860
same time zone we have a number of

00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:17,510
friends in common

00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,640
we work really close to each other and

00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:21,500
we could just go out for drink so if he

00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,480
had any problems there was that

00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,149
immediate support network of someone

00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,250
like him available and unsurprisingly we

00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:29,480
managed to get him from someone who

00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,480
turned up on the mailing list with a

00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:37,720
problem to committer really quickly if

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:40,220
you are the only person in your country

00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,410
involved in the project and the only

00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,390
person your linguistic group involved in

00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:46,730
the project it can be really really

00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:49,579
tough to find anyone who's going to be

00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,529
there to tell you how to get involved

00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:53,720
how to deal with these problems how to

00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:56,050
deal with the timezone how to deal with

00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,250
the language how to deal with mistakes

00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:00,290
how to deal with the fact that you've

00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,640
just got this email from an American

00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:04,160
that seems really threatening because

00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,290
you've misunderstood two words and that

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,450
was actually some linguistic joke from

00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:10,040
an 80s TV show that you've never even

00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:11,209
heard of that made it seem really

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,610
threatening but actually with someone

00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:15,920
being jokey and friendly if you've not

00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:21,560
got that peer support around you it

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:23,720
could be really hard and so company used

00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:27,709
to work called torch box when I joined

00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:30,860
it was about 20% women and as it grew it

00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:33,949
tended to stay at about 20% women for a

00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:36,829
while and then without really making any

00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:39,290
big effort just through happenstance and

00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:43,779
recommendations it got to about 35%

00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:47,420
women and then it went to 50% women

00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:50,000
there was this magic trigger point where

00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,560
there were enough women that more women

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,750
were willing to join women who wouldn't

00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,970
go and be the first one but were quite

00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,680
happy to be the 17th one came in and

00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:01,550
joined and the company very quickly

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,250
pivoted into near parity and no one sat

00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:06,260
around and decided on this I don't think

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,540
the women necessarily consciously said

00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:10,910
oh I'm not going to go and work there

00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:13,220
but being the first was scary to a lot

00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:15,860
of them and we had to get a number of

00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:18,500
women in who were willing to be first

00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:20,390
and so we built up that Network that

00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:24,110
peer support to bring the rest in and

00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:26,509
get to parity so be aware that

00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:28,129
it can be a lot of effort to support

00:17:26,509 --> 00:17:29,869
those new people but it will pay off you

00:17:28,129 --> 00:17:32,239
can make your community more diverse by

00:17:29,869 --> 00:17:34,039
supporting and really looking after and

00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:35,629
nurturing the people willing to put up

00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:39,440
with being first and then they can bring

00:17:35,629 --> 00:17:41,360
more in okay so a bit more on language

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:48,230
also known as la fat net con he's in

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:51,830
France so speaking in a second or third

00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:55,820
language is more tiring and speaking in

00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:58,940
your native language potentially a lot

00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:01,249
more and if I'm in France and I'm trying

00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,350
to speak in French the whole day gets

00:18:01,249 --> 00:18:06,019
about five o'clock and turning to a

00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:07,580
gibbering wreck if I just push on

00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:10,369
through and keep going then about seven

00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:13,159
o'clock I can't even talk English it's

00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:14,989
quite incredible you don't think that

00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:16,549
it's being tiring but you just find

00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:18,080
yourself a lot more drained that

00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:20,389
constantly thinking that constantly

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,700
translating flipping back and forth to

00:18:20,389 --> 00:18:25,220
context shifting it can really tie you

00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,499
out so if you've got someone involved on

00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,259
your team in your project who doesn't

00:18:27,499 --> 00:18:31,909
speak English as a first language

00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:33,230
they're probably putting more effort in

00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:35,720
for the same level of participation

00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:37,759
they're finding it harder and if you're

00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:43,249
having this massive long mailing-list

00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:45,350
rant at fifteen emails an hour not

00:18:43,249 --> 00:18:48,379
naming any names but maybe board a tour

00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:50,119
members out on certain bad days you've

00:18:48,379 --> 00:18:52,340
got people who are having to mentally

00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:55,070
translate this that can be really

00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,960
draining and so even if some of you you

00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:58,669
like well I can kind of follow all that

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,799
and still get a couple of patches in

00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:02,659
people who aren't doing so first

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,429
language maybe struggling maybe just

00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:05,749
reading the mailing list has taken all

00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:10,299
their available energy and they've got

00:19:05,749 --> 00:19:14,019
nothing left to be be respectful of them

00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:16,820
now the challenge getting a word in I

00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:20,299
can be in a group of French speakers and

00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:24,379
follow the entire conversation but it

00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:26,749
takes me maybe half a second longer than

00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:28,220
the native speakers to think of the

00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:30,700
thing I want to say to joining the

00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:33,259
conversation in a fast-moving group

00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,940
you've missed that window that pause

00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:36,379
where it was right okay she's going to

00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,350
go next and you're like okay oh yeah I

00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:41,070
know

00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:42,240
okay missed it okay talking away yeah

00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:45,240
yeah I sure got some it say on that

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,850
what's the word for community okay yeah

00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,580
okay missed it and I can mean a group

00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:52,260
where I understand everything I can be

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,299
sat there for an hour and I can have

00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,640
lots of things to say that I never get

00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:58,740
to say because it's just taking you that

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,020
moment longer to think of the right

00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:03,720
words to open my mouth and start talking

00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:06,360
and the communities moved on the next

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,510
person speaking I've missed my chance to

00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,309
get a word in just really quite

00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,799
frustrating some like hey I want to join

00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:16,110
in I want to say something but I just

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:19,409
missed it is that if you're having

00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:22,200
in-person meetings allow a little bit of

00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:24,059
extra time allow bit of extra time for

00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,909
people who don't have English as a first

00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:28,650
language and need a little bit longer

00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:34,860
allow a bit of extra time for people who

00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:37,470
are the Shire if you are very forceful

00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:41,340
and outgoing and bolshy you may be

00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:44,909
willing to sit down and go hey I'm

00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:46,289
naturally met you but hi yeah

00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:50,280
some random guy I never met before

00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:53,039
Bangla say hi if I'm a little bit more

00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,799
introverted either by nature or just

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,630
because I'm in another country speaking

00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:00,330
another language and me anyone like me

00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:04,200
and I'm a bit like largest just kind of

00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:05,510
wait a bit if you're looking around the

00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,830
table looking around the discussion

00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:09,960
spotting the people who are a bit less

00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:13,340
hesitant its are a bit more hesitant to

00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:15,539
join in and be welcoming to them say hey

00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:18,210
Dave young really said anything for a

00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:19,380
while do you want to join in or should

00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:22,169
we just get you another coffee wake you

00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:25,140
up but you know just spot that you're

00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:26,970
ignoring people people who are seeing

00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,770
different people are feeling tired maybe

00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,970
not willing to join in even though

00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:31,650
they've got interesting things to say

00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:33,570
maybe they're going to have a really

00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:36,690
interesting point maybe they'll be like

00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:39,630
hey Nick you know that test you added

00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:42,030
last week you do know that not everyone

00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:45,840
in the world has UTC and local time is

00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:48,240
the same and that test now fails me I'm

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,460
like well everyone lives in Oxford

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,349
everyone has UTC logs I'm the same for

00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,700
half the year

00:21:51,349 --> 00:21:56,009
incidentally that was a bug that

00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,889
happened three years on the trot and I

00:21:56,009 --> 00:22:00,749
was working for a certain uk-based

00:21:57,889 --> 00:22:03,239
enterprise software company because all

00:22:00,749 --> 00:22:05,609
the developers were in the UK or

00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:07,859
Portugal which was also achieved but yet

00:22:05,609 --> 00:22:10,799
everyone was all in places and it's

00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:13,440
every March on that magic Sunday the

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,539
build failed because one of us had made

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,729
that assumption if we'd had a developer

00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:20,820
running the test suite anywhere else in

00:22:17,729 --> 00:22:22,109
the world we'd have caught that that we

00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,419
were just a little bit too much of a

00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:26,580
monoculture so look out for the people

00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:29,190
who are different who are struggling to

00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,839
speak give them the chance because they

00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,799
may well have something interesting and

00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:34,200
different that you haven't thought of

00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:37,639
that will give you the new use case

00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:40,950
point out the bug thing you haven't seen

00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:42,719
another ship people in other languages

00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:47,369
is it can be quite hard for them to make

00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:51,089
a joke because people will assume that

00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:55,469
they've made a mistake not that they're

00:22:51,089 --> 00:22:56,820
telling a joke which can be quite

00:22:55,469 --> 00:22:58,349
disheartening if you kind of come up

00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,999
with this really funny joke with a play

00:22:58,349 --> 00:23:01,710
on words and you say it and it's

00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:03,269
completely right and everyone's like no

00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,649
no it's it's not that interesting I know

00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:06,779
that was the joke that was the point

00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:09,119
like oh yeah yeah it's quite funny we

00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:11,219
just thought you made a mistake and you

00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:12,749
do that three or four times and I'm just

00:23:11,219 --> 00:23:14,129
I'm just giving up making jokes to my

00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:15,019
French friends it's just not worth the

00:23:14,129 --> 00:23:18,299
effort

00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:19,710
missed the punch line but then if you're

00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:21,269
interacting me with me on a French

00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:23,700
mainly she might be like Nick's really

00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:25,049
dull he's not making any jokes why is he

00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,599
being so straight why he using such

00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:29,729
precise boring language well because I

00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:32,309
got burn and then no one found the joke

00:23:29,729 --> 00:23:34,289
funny and and I gave up but then you end

00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:36,169
up with a different perception of me if

00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:38,849
you speak to me in English - in French

00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:41,009
you might be like all that new person

00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:43,019
they're just they're just no fun no

00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:46,679
they've been burnt too much candy

00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:47,879
welcoming be aware of it written versus

00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:49,830
spoken another one you might have

00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:54,509
someone who's really good on the mailing

00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:59,549
list tariff on e to join in on your

00:23:54,509 --> 00:24:01,109
stand up Google hangout and scrum thing

00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:04,320
you might like hey we've got all these

00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:04,950
guys in China and we went to this huge

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,810
effort

00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:08,850
to make her daily stand up be at the

00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:11,280
right time for them to join in and they

00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:14,130
all just look they're like rabbits and a

00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,180
headlight but I know they speak English

00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,430
because they're always writing to me on

00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,900
the mailing list well maybe not

00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,400
maybe they're really good at written

00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,730
English and don't have the confidence to

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,860
speak there's an issue with the French

00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:27,840
school system where most of the people

00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,760
in France learning English don't get to

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,200
practice it very much and when they're

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,360
practicing it it's almost never with

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,720
native speakers so when you meet someone

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,830
in France and you're like oh can we

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,060
switch to English for a minute because

00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,800
I'm just feeling really tired and

00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,840
they're like no I'm a English bad

00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,340
anything what I've seen an email from

00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,990
you and you get toward them and actually

00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,990
it's really good but they're lacking the

00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:51,150
confidence so don't assume that because

00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:52,440
people write well they can speak well

00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:54,900
don't assume the people who can speak

00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:59,820
well can write well and don't assume

00:24:54,900 --> 00:25:01,350
that magically making your daily standup

00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:05,150
happen in the right timezone is going to

00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:05,150
be all it takes to get them involved

00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:15,150
okay

00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:17,330
trying new things one of the big issues

00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:21,830
with getting new people involved in your

00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:24,750
community is a sort of inherent built-in

00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:29,880
negativity most of us have about things

00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:31,110
outside our comfort zone good Dave why

00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,670
don't you get involved in one of the big

00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:34,740
data projects and Dave might be like oh

00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:37,350
well I really like all the content stuff

00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:39,600
but I'd be rubbish on the huge big data

00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:41,160
too many machines now I won't give a try

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:47,370
I'll just stick in my own happy little

00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:50,190
comfort zone so speaking who here has

00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:52,310
done what I'm currently done and stand

00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:55,280
up in front of a bunch of strangers and

00:25:52,310 --> 00:26:00,420
spouted off hopefully informing them

00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:02,930
okay quite a number was it easy the

00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,930
first time

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:09,520
we pretty terrified that first time you

00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:12,100
stood up with the microphone okay

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:15,040
if you're trying to get more people in

00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:17,230
your community involved in presenting

00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,000
you have to kind of hold their hand

00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:21,760
don't just be like hey I can speak

00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,799
everyone can speak yeah they can but

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,780
they need some help first if you're

00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:27,400
trying to get people out of that comfort

00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:29,110
zone and into something else you're

00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:32,260
going to need to give them some support

00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:35,860
some advice and be mindful of people who

00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:38,169
even then aren't willing to do it yet

00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:40,360
another one designed I used to think I

00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:42,549
had no I for design I still think I have

00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,970
no eye for design but for some reason

00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:46,960
people keep asking me to help knock-up

00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:50,320
standard templates for a lot of these

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:53,890
conferences because even though I could

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:57,070
never get a job in graphic design I am

00:26:53,890 --> 00:27:00,850
apparently better at it than many other

00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:03,820
coders but that's fine because we're not

00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:06,850
trying to enter a slide presentation

00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:09,429
making competition with trying to get

00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:12,760
some information across you don't have

00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:15,100
to be the world expert in it if you are

00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,620
the best person in the group of

00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:20,770
volunteers you have available that's

00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:22,480
more than good enough don't let that

00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:24,640
perfection get in the way of trying

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,600
something new especially if there's some

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,429
other people around to help you out

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:34,390
another thing that affects a lot of

00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:39,010
newcomers is being almost there but not

00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:41,470
knowing it so think back some of you a

00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:44,980
little way some of you a long way to

00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:46,929
maths classes in school I think one is

00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:49,030
really long problems where you're

00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:51,640
working through for a whole page and you

00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:55,090
get to the bottom you like no I'm almost

00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:56,590
no I can't fail can't I can't solve this

00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,450
problem and then you give it to your

00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:00,160
teacher and they're like there's just

00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:02,590
one more line you have to put in and

00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,280
then you've got the answer and I never

00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:06,160
thought of that

00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,930
everyone please say that I wasn't anyone

00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:10,380
to do this everyone

00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:14,830
can you all remember that that kind of

00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:16,150
math problem got some people shaking

00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:18,760
their heads I think maybe you're all

00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:20,830
just math geniuses okay let's try

00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:23,680
another one learning the new computer

00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:25,930
game you ever had that thing where

00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,360
you're doing a puzzle game and you're

00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:30,250
kind of doing this puzzle for two hours

00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:33,460
and then you're like are galactically

00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:35,830
and just Google and you're like oh that

00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,480
picture was a button okay kya just

00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:40,420
complete the level and you were almost

00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:43,120
there and you spent hours struggling

00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:47,920
without realizing that last little bit

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:50,830
that you could you're almost there if

00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,630
that's happening to you in open source

00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:57,370
or in work that's going to knock your

00:28:52,630 --> 00:29:00,070
confidence if you can't do three puzzles

00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:02,410
in a row in a game you're probably going

00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:05,560
to give up building on that game's

00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:06,940
rubbish depending on how confident you

00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,760
are you'll either say I'm rubbish at

00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:11,140
this game or that game is rubbish but

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,750
the end result was still the same you're

00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:15,790
going to stop playing it if you're

00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:17,920
trying to welcome someone different into

00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:20,620
a new open-source community to a new

00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,570
team at work and they struggle three

00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,670
times they're probably going to give up

00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:26,740
and walk away then walk away from your

00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:28,720
community and you just lost that new

00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:30,370
contributor and what's more you might

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,680
have just lost that first mover

00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:34,390
contributor that person who is willing

00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,010
to stick out and put up with a lot of

00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:38,770
stuff that would have helped bring in

00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:42,790
more people from that underrepresented

00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:44,920
group so try and give extra support to

00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:46,840
newbies don't be like hey surely

00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,510
everyone knows this is a really obvious

00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:52,090
thing why we had another person saying I

00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:54,280
can't get the bill to work just the

00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:56,530
rubbish I'm just go tell them a long

00:29:54,280 --> 00:30:00,370
lengthy detail how stupid they are on

00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:03,100
the mailing list there you go could it

00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:05,170
just be that we have assumed too much

00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,990
about people trying to get started their

00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:10,780
project maybe we should be nice to this

00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:12,310
person and adding that extra missing

00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:14,410
step and the documentation that trips

00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:16,960
everyone over rather than like I can

00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:19,110
make it compile mavens not very hard

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,710
you're stupid

00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:24,570
just think about that experience when

00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:26,340
you're playing a new game doing a master

00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:29,990
of the first time and someone's almost

00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:32,519
there and help them through that and

00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:34,830
then ideally also get them to fix the

00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:37,080
documentation because the people that

00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:38,970
are struggling and have just solved it

00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:45,450
are often the best place to help other

00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:47,010
new people in through that gap key thing

00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:49,399
for new people coming to your

00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:57,389
communities is positive first feedback

00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:59,940
who here uses Instagram okay you go on

00:30:57,389 --> 00:31:03,000
Instagram you put up a photo you put in

00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:05,250
a couple of hashtags and unless you are

00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,929
doing it on a public holiday of the

00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:09,750
wrong time of night with the wrong

00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:11,760
hashtag within an hour and then it'll -

00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:15,059
you start getting the little likes come

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,799
through that first photo you took maybe

00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:18,330
isn't very good maybe you could have

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,289
done some more stuff with filters maybe

00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:20,669
you haven't quite worked out the

00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:22,679
hashtags but you're still going to get

00:31:20,669 --> 00:31:24,240
likes because people are going to be

00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:26,340
browsing through seeing it and be like

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,250
thats confessor you get likes you get

00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:31,230
little mini dopamine hits but you get

00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:33,029
that first little bit of feedback they

00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,289
put a photo up hey someone actually

00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:35,970
liked it okay I'll go and pick some more

00:31:34,289 --> 00:31:39,450
photos we're going to share some more

00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:42,230
photos that first time you join the

00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:47,130
community you get positive feedback

00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:49,110
quickly not hey I oh I found this

00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:51,149
project and I opened up all the requests

00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:52,679
and it got ignored for six months and

00:31:51,149 --> 00:31:54,080
then someone closed it without talking

00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:57,750
to me because they've moved on

00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:00,809
that's a bad first experience that turn

00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:02,100
up get the likes get involved someone

00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:04,260
might come along later and be like hey

00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:06,929
you really ought to turn down the white

00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:08,760
balance and put some more hashtags on

00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:10,169
and here's an introduction to digital

00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,179
photography that you'll find really

00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:18,149
useful they can come later but you get

00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:21,179
them hooked snack exchange sites except

00:32:18,149 --> 00:32:21,480
Stack Overflow okay that's another show

00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:24,690
hands

00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:28,370
you hit use your Stack Overflow okay who

00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:32,640
here uses any other sonic on the network

00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:36,660
server for travel expatriates French

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:39,450
Christianity Islam cooking aviation

00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:41,820
anything like that okay the experience

00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:43,920
on most of the other sites can be quite

00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:48,060
different you turn up and they be like

00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:49,560
hey welcome it's great post have you

00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,150
have a look at this one over there might

00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,130
solve your issue but if not can you

00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:57,270
clarify a little bit help us hone in

00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:58,610
it's really welcoming if you turn up on

00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:01,110
Stack Overflow

00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:05,630
with pretty much anything less than a

00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:12,870
PhD thesis you will get four down votes

00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:14,580
three edits are close possibly the close

00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:17,160
will be to the duplicate that solves

00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:19,020
your problem other times it's - a

00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,700
duplicate solves what you've written

00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:24,450
that wasn't actually quite your problem

00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:26,460
and then you try again and you get

00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:28,110
download download close and then you're

00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,600
going to try third time and it won't let

00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:32,280
you because you've been banned because

00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,050
your reputation is too low and you've

00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:36,150
had too much negative feedback and you

00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:39,870
just be like what am I even bothering

00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:43,200
with that first experience on Stack

00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:47,430
Overflow is kind of optimized for the

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:51,930
attention of the experts not for the

00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:53,430
newbie you don't get a lot of help can I

00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:55,680
have to find out the hard way if you

00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:58,830
look on the meta Stack Overflow which is

00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:00,120
the discussion site for admin it you'll

00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:02,700
see lots of newbies coming in - like

00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:05,220
what did I do wrong and someone was like

00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,810
I actually yeah so you are nearly there

00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,429
but what you need to do is go and read

00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:10,050
this help text here

00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:11,669
and then you need to go and see that you

00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:13,260
click up there and explain why that

00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:15,300
duplicate is match to your problem and

00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,640
then the Edit question it gets reopened

00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,290
and three weeks later they've got a good

00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:21,179
rating and you know it's all been good

00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:23,130
but a lot of people that first

00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:24,780
experience is just down low down low

00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:26,340
comment that seems to say I'm an idiot

00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,560
common that seems to say I'm an idiot

00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:30,600
close though that closes on a duplicate

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:34,230
of something else and it's just really

00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:35,730
depressing if the experience of

00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:38,120
contributing to your project is like

00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:42,060
that you're going to lose those people

00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:45,149
if you immediately close their jira as a

00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:48,149
duplicate and that's it

00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:50,569
if you close their pull request without

00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:54,119
commenting on it or if you ignore it

00:34:50,569 --> 00:34:56,819
they're not going to come back if you at

00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:58,980
least say hey thanks for that it turns

00:34:56,819 --> 00:35:02,490
out we solve that - releases ago but we

00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:05,759
used a slightly different name we're

00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:10,049
calling it formula revaluation but you

00:35:05,759 --> 00:35:11,369
were trying to do data calculations but

00:35:10,049 --> 00:35:14,700
that's okay that's the same thing it's

00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:17,609
over here then you haven't scared off

00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:20,730
that first person and whatsmore someone

00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:22,769
else coming in from google who expressed

00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:24,450
the problem the same way as that newbie

00:35:22,769 --> 00:35:27,210
which isn't the way that your project

00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:29,039
expresses it sees it and they see a nice

00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:31,890
friendly welcoming community that's

00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,940
helping point people not unlike oh god

00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:34,680
I'm not going to join them they were

00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,940
just really rude to that person who's

00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,369
having the same problem that I've got

00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,539
here I've got the answer but now I'm

00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:44,039
going to in find someone else to spend

00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:47,549
my time with so think about that first

00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:48,960
experience that your users get think

00:35:47,549 --> 00:35:51,269
about the ways that you may be

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,180
inadvertently driving away a lot of

00:35:51,269 --> 00:35:55,559
contributors and especially contributors

00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,839
plane life on a higher difficulty

00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:59,999
setting people who are already tired

00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:02,999
from spending the whole day working in a

00:35:59,999 --> 00:36:05,519
second language who are tired from being

00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:07,650
the only woman in the group or the only

00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:09,749
Indian guy in the group or the only

00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:11,670
British guy in this American group or

00:36:09,749 --> 00:36:14,400
whatever it is people are already

00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,809
feeling a little bit tired and on edge

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,109
and unwelcome from all these other

00:36:15,809 --> 00:36:20,910
things if they then hit that unwelcoming

00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:25,589
first response they're probably going to

00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:30,019
walk away and you've missed them okay so

00:36:25,589 --> 00:36:32,009
a few other resources for people who are

00:36:30,019 --> 00:36:34,220
finding some of this chiming on with you

00:36:32,009 --> 00:36:34,220
and

00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:42,900
the slides will be up later you can

00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:45,330
click through to those and if you want

00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:48,600
to know a lot of reading you go to the

00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:50,370
geek feminism site and just follow off

00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,570
from that there's a lot of information

00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:55,590
there are a lot of links to other

00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:59,180
resources and there's a really good post

00:36:55,590 --> 00:37:02,760
on medium about a lot of the reasons why

00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:05,400
women are not sticking around to the

00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,920
same extent as men in tech while we are

00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,080
having a leaky funnel and things that we

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,440
can do about it and it's a really good

00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:16,500
craic post talking about some of the

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,830
more societal issues that are causing us

00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:21,690
to miss out on people causing issues in

00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:22,590
our society and things that you might

00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:24,330
not be aware of

00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:26,280
again if you're playing life on easy and

00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:27,480
you go into that first beam level and

00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,390
there's one monster and that's fine

00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,280
maybe pointing out that what some of

00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:36,480
those other 50 monsters are that the

00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:38,790
people playing on harder getting and I

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,430
would really suggest now that you have

00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:44,220
seen a diversity talk from a straight

00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:46,740
middle class white guy and hopefully

00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:50,910
didn't get too terrified since only

00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:53,970
about three people walked out please go

00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:56,640
and see a diversity talk from someone

00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:58,050
who's diversity is not just hey I'm a

00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,560
British guy that spent six months in

00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:01,410
France

00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:05,340
please currency a diversity talk from

00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:07,860
people who have experienced all of it to

00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:10,830
have played life on medium or hard for

00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:12,360
more than six months hear about the real

00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:15,050
problems that they've been facing and

00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:18,930
the real things that we've got to do

00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:21,270
it's not just enough to say I put up a

00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,770
contributing page and now I'm going to

00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:27,030
get all the women and all the people

00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:29,250
from India and China joining it we have

00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:31,650
to make changes ourselves we have to be

00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:36,440
more welcoming more accommodating we

00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:38,940
have to do some work and we have to know

00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,350
why and how and it will have big effects

00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:43,260
on our project it will make things

00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:45,840
better so now that you're hopefully a

00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:48,150
little bit more aware please please go

00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,710
and see one of the other diversity talks

00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:52,410
going on please

00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:54,180
learn more about the issue I'm hoping

00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:57,660
that some of you will have seen ways

00:38:54,180 --> 00:39:01,349
that you can personally profit from

00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:03,089
being more aware from diversity so even

00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:04,800
if you walk out of here not interested

00:39:03,089 --> 00:39:06,119
at all in bringing more people in you

00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,250
will hopefully be a slightly better

00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:11,550
project member slightly better employee

00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:13,230
that if possible also try and make the

00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:15,690
world a better place make your projects

00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:17,510
a better place learn a bit more get more

00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:25,020
involved

00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:28,530
it is almost lunchtime almost if anyone

00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:30,960
would like to ask a question I may be

00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:33,060
able to answer it if it's on living in

00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,369
France probably if it's on any really

00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:38,040
hard diversity problems probably not

00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:41,730
and also if anyone would like to suggest

00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:43,800
any more learning resources please let

00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:48,330
me know I can add an extra slide on the

00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:50,430
end before I post the slides and anyone

00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:52,920
interested in getting more women

00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:55,290
involved who's new to this stuff and

00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:58,410
there's a really good book called

00:39:55,290 --> 00:40:00,210
unlocking the clubhouse which looks at

00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:02,400
ways to get more women involved in

00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:04,380
computer science and education and it

00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,260
was jointly written by the Carnegie

00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:09,990
Mellon computer science department and I

00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:13,770
think sociology department but certainly

00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:15,480
one of the other departments that knows

00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:18,359
a lot about this stuff and I found it a

00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:21,690
really fascinating read about some

00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:24,960
simple changes that could help and help

00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:27,180
all sorts of people and some things that

00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,280
people were doing without understanding

00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:31,170
that we're actually really quite bad so

00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,910
have a read of that one have a read

00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:37,800
through some of the other things linked

00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:42,660
from it and it's good just spend some

00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:45,089
time read learn talk to people who

00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:47,880
aren't like you but please don't do it

00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:49,320
in a scary way don't go hey you're the

00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,810
one woman in the room tell me about all

00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,580
women because as I've mentioned if

00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:55,290
someone comes to me like hey you're the

00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:57,480
one British guy in France tell me all

00:40:55,290 --> 00:41:00,359
about Britain it's it's kind of scary

00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:03,269
maybe nice have a friendly chat learn

00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:04,679
from them be welcoming don't don't

00:41:03,269 --> 00:41:09,929
to point them out with the old one out

00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:25,589
and scare them okay anyone have any

00:41:09,929 --> 00:41:27,959
questions with people who are speaking

00:41:25,589 --> 00:41:30,719
their native language but our have

00:41:27,959 --> 00:41:32,489
strong introvert dependencies you're in

00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:37,679
an office where everyone goes out at

00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:40,499
five or six above get drinks that person

00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:42,599
allotments just wants to go switch them

00:41:40,499 --> 00:41:52,289
off yeah no they're not being antisocial

00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:54,479
they don't yeah if you're if you're

00:41:52,289 --> 00:41:56,699
trying to do a team-building thing and

00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:59,279
you think that a great way to do team

00:41:56,699 --> 00:42:02,059
building is to take everyone to the pub

00:41:59,279 --> 00:42:04,469
after work and give them free beer

00:42:02,059 --> 00:42:07,949
that's not going to be popular with

00:42:04,469 --> 00:42:09,179
people with caring commitments people

00:42:07,949 --> 00:42:12,719
who have to pick kids up from school

00:42:09,179 --> 00:42:15,269
single parents people who are introvert

00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:17,429
and really hate going out with all those

00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:19,109
people people with ear problems who

00:42:17,429 --> 00:42:21,899
can't be an allow bar trainer here

00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:23,759
people with alcohol and other substance

00:42:21,899 --> 00:42:25,409
abuse issues that don't want to put

00:42:23,759 --> 00:42:27,389
themselves back in that situation

00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:32,329
there's all sorts of different reasons

00:42:27,389 --> 00:42:35,309
why what works brilliantly for you as a

00:42:32,329 --> 00:42:37,409
team-building thing is not automatically

00:42:35,309 --> 00:42:38,880
going to work brilliantly for everyone

00:42:37,409 --> 00:42:41,309
that you're trying to encourage and if

00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,529
you're not careful you're team building

00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:45,149
event will turn off a lot of people and

00:42:43,529 --> 00:42:50,699
make them more unhappy than they were to

00:42:45,149 --> 00:42:52,889
start with just kind of be aware don't

00:42:50,699 --> 00:42:57,059
say hey everyone we're going to go to

00:42:52,889 --> 00:42:59,069
the pub try and find out what people are

00:42:57,059 --> 00:43:02,909
actually going to want to do and work

00:42:59,069 --> 00:43:04,709
around it and I know when I was out I've

00:43:02,909 --> 00:43:06,509
got a team in India the first time I

00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:09,479
went out there I was like hey you should

00:43:06,509 --> 00:43:11,219
we do this and they said yes and it

00:43:09,479 --> 00:43:13,739
turned out they didn't like it but they

00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:15,779
were a bit too polite to say no so the

00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:16,920
next time I was like we should do

00:43:15,779 --> 00:43:20,050
something

00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:22,780
what what are we going to do and they

00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:25,150
weren't last time we went to the pub and

00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:27,010
I think yeah but is that what you want

00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:28,990
to do or you know should we do something

00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:31,900
at lunchtime or an evening is it better

00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:33,310
do it midweek or on the weekend and the

00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,290
answer actually turned out to be that

00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:38,200
they wanted to go to this really nice

00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:39,490
new Indian restaurant that opened up

00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,870
around the corner that was a bit

00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:42,700
expensive that they'd heard good things

00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:44,620
about and they wanted to go at lunchtime

00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,530
so they could all still go and pick up

00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:48,730
their kids on the way home from work so

00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:50,920
that's what we did for the team-building

00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:52,600
thing I'm like but that's not what I had

00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,940
chosen but actually everyone's now

00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,260
really happy and smiley and then they

00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,280
did a load of work in the evening when

00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:00,960
they kept the gods bed that they

00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:03,430
wouldn't normally have done okay - just

00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,530
don't assume that everyone is

00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:07,480
automatically like you even if they look

00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:09,130
like you and really don't assume they

00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,960
like you if they don't look like you if

00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:14,200
they don't tell are you kind of be

00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:18,270
welcoming and I think there are

00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:20,530
resources online for kind of doing

00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:22,000
events in the evenings or conferences

00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:24,910
that are more welcoming to all sorts of

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,730
different people how to run Tech

00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:30,300
evangelism events that don't assume that

00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:34,780
everyone is I don't know in the Bay Area

00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:37,840
free on a weekend has no kids that that

00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:39,970
does seem to be a surprising issue I see

00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:42,430
in a lot of that open source stuff like

00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:46,630
hey who wants to learn our thing come

00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:48,550
along on Saturday in San Jose and then

00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:50,410
like why I'm not in San Jose and if I

00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:53,680
walls maybe add you know have other

00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:55,930
plans or some kids or parents that need

00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,970
looking after or any of these other

00:44:55,930 --> 00:45:00,460
things and they're like I wonder why we

00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:03,220
only got white guys aged under 35 to

00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:05,320
come along so I don't know maybe because

00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:08,710
you kind of self selected by the event

00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:10,240
year and some of these things are going

00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:11,940
to be really hard there are people that

00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:15,130
are going to be tough to reach out to

00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:18,220
there are going to be things where the

00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:19,960
best event you can run for one group is

00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:23,470
going to be the worst event you can run

00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:25,330
for another if there was a silver bullet

00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:27,820
that my talk would have had a very

00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:30,530
different title probably involving the

00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:33,540
words silver and bullet

00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:35,670
just kind of work with your team work

00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:39,119
with your community try and find out

00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:40,799
what's going to be best for them then

00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,660
look and see what other resources exist

00:45:40,799 --> 00:45:46,020
online go and talk to other groups be

00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:48,240
like I'm trying to do a play event but

00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:50,099
please not that cool but Katie cares

00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,049
quite so much boy let me go and ask the

00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:53,970
teacher guys what they're doing and hey

00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:56,609
maybe we'll just do one joint event and

00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:59,700
then we'll learn from them and just find

00:45:56,609 --> 00:46:02,250
similar groups learn share that's

00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:09,210
another thing if you found something

00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:11,309
that does work let other people know we

00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:16,970
have one minute left until we get thrown

00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:20,640
out and you're all looking a bit stunned

00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:22,589
okay thank you all for coming thank you

00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:26,780
to everyone except the three people that

00:46:22,589 --> 00:46:33,760
left not leaving thank you

00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:33,760
