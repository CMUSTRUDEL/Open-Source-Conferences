Description: 
	Keynote: Apache CouchDB: A Tale of Community, Cooperation and Code - Adam Kocoloski, Fellow and CTO for the Watson Data Platform, IBM

There are no shortage of reasons why an open source project can stagnate. Yet despite confronting many of these challenges, Apache CouchDB has been resilient in the nearly 10 years since becoming an Apache Software Foundation project, to the point where today, its codebase and community are about as strong as theyâ€™ve ever been. The constant thread throughout the life of the project has been the consistent support of the ASF and IBM.

Adam Kocoloski, CTO of IBM Watson Data Platform, co-founder of Cloudant and PMC member for CouchDB, shares his perspective on what IBM finds so valuable about the Apache Software Foundation, through the lens of projects like CouchDB, Apache Spark, Apache Edgent and Apache OpenWhisk.
