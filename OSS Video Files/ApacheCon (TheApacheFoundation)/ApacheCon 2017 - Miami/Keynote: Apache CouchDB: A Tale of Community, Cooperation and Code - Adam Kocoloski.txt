Description: 
	Keynote: Apache CouchDB: A Tale of Community, Cooperation and Code - Adam Kocoloski, Fellow and CTO for the Watson Data Platform, IBM

There are no shortage of reasons why an open source project can stagnate. Yet despite confronting many of these challenges, Apache CouchDB has been resilient in the nearly 10 years since becoming an Apache Software Foundation project, to the point where today, its codebase and community are about as strong as theyâ€™ve ever been. The constant thread throughout the life of the project has been the consistent support of the ASF and IBM.

Adam Kocoloski, CTO of IBM Watson Data Platform, co-founder of Cloudant and PMC member for CouchDB, shares his perspective on what IBM finds so valuable about the Apache Software Foundation, through the lens of projects like CouchDB, Apache Spark, Apache Edgent and Apache OpenWhisk.

yeah so I'm delighted to be here this is

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:09,570
you know as rich might have alluded to

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,849
this is my first Apache con I don't have

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,650
the retro t-shirt to wear like rich and

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:14,820
Sam but I picked mine up this morning

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,660
and I'll be happy to sport it in the

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,430
future I am really excited to talk to

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,830
you today because you know essentially I

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,320
given an opportunity to talk about you

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,789
know what something that has consumed an

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,800
untold number of hours over the past

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:33,899
decade for me and I'm excited to share

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,640
you know some of our experiences in the

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,370
CouchDB project because I think they are

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,899
somebody events over the past 10 years I

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,059
think are events that a lot of us in our

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,640
various projects encounter and I think

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,469
the way the project responded to them

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,600
the way the project grew over time is a

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,239
testament to the support that BASF

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,969
provides and it's just I mean I think

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,129
it's just a fantastic journey so yeah

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,770
this is about apache couchdb

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:02,070
in large part and the journey that we've

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,809
had so that journey begins almost 10

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,159
years ago now which reflecting on this

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:09,390
talk as I was preparing to give it was

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:12,450
uh was I don't know it made me fuel that

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,580
journey start for all intents and

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,759
purposes with gentleman by the name of

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,259
Damian Katz who back in 2008 published a

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,630
blog post that said hey I've accepted a

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:25,049
new full-time position at IBM to work on

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,790
CouchDB and as a condition of that new

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,380
position I'm donating all the code to

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,079
the Apache Software Foundation Damian

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,400
had previously had a you know a project

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,750
on SourceForge a Google code or

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,909
something like that just kind of hacking

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,189
away on it on his you know his spare

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,710
time and actually more than his spare

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:43,500
time if you he gave a fantastic talk at

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,540
a ruby Fringe in 2009 and called CouchDB

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,829
and me to talked about the investments

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,049
that he had made at a personal level of

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,750
seeing this project through it really is

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,810
it's it's quite a it's quite a talk I'd

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,369
encourage you to go see it so this was

00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,990
the start of the journey and you know I

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,090
wasn't there at the time but I'm told

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,920
that in addition to his many hats that

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,229
he wears at the ASF mr. Sam ruby was

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,689
also instrumental in bringing Damian

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:09,509
back to IBM and creating a space for him

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,000
to go work on CouchDB under the aegis of

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:16,100
the Apache Software Foundation

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,260
so we got that code in there and you

00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,610
know we brought the product of the

00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,740
incubator over the course of the next

00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:26,630
several months that project graduated

00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:28,610
and the company that I had started had

00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,930
gotten interested in the project we had

00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:33,230
started contributing through the course

00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:34,790
of 2008 and 2009 and at the end of 2009

00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,860
we had launched a cloud service based

00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,210
largely on this codebase and I thought

00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,860
that was an important Testament for the

00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,000
project because now we've got you know

00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,160
all sort of skin in the game we've got

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,440
well we have sort of course understand

00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,000
the Apache way and the sort of fact that

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,620
every one of our committers is entering

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,020
into the project on his or her own terms

00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,090
it's also important to have you know

00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,320
folks who are really committed to to the

00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,350
success of the project in the long term

00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,050
and in 2010 we reached our 1.0 release

00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,940
so in this initial phase of the project

00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,350
kind of think like okay this is when

00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,300
things are a little easy we're creating

00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,670
technical debt not burning it down right

00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,140
we are you know the code is fun it's

00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,760
easy to write it's exciting there's a

00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,830
lot of velocity new contributors are

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,320
coming in you know media wants to talk

00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:17,269
about it like life is good life is fun

00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:20,570
except for you know when that 1.0

00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:22,640
release came out there was uh we had we

00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:24,950
had a little sort of data loss bug in

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,800
there that you know yours truly was

00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:30,470
responsible for so we had a 24 by 7 sort

00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:34,340
of coding session to go and mitigate it

00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,360
and release 1.1 a week later track down

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,040
every single one who might have been

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,260
affected and worked it through with them

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,900
but this was exciting this was good and

00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,940
then after 1.0 you know we were trying

00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,130
to figure out okay what how does the

00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:49,670
project go forward and then this

00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:51,200
happened my colleagues in the CouchDB

00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:54,049
project had you know in the couch one

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,610
company merged with a company called mem

00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:57,560
beasts that was providing memcache D

00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:00,320
support and they announced themselves as

00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:04,640
Couchbase right databases just got more

00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:06,049
awesome we said okay in the community we

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,760
feel like all right what does this mean

00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:09,080
for CouchDB both on a technical level

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,390
like we're looking at the memcache

00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,860
decode and trying to sort of fit that

00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,090
square peg into that round hole and

00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,799
figure out how the architecture is mind

00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,970
aligned and you know this was kind of

00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,310
sprung on us we weren't quite sure what

00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,500
to do with it and on a sort of political

00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,110
level to on an organizational level what

00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,020
is this going to mean this is a big

00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,949
yeah and everybody said okay we're going

00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,389
to make it work we're going to figure

00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:31,720
out what makes sense the project is

00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:34,590
going to kind of you know we will keep

00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,659
on going this will be fine

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:39,310
we started to make friends with Shane

00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:40,360
and the folks in brand and trademarks

00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,830
and whatnot and the Apache Software

00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,860
Foundation I'm sure they got tired of

00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,759
hearing couch TV versus couch bass

00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,830
branding questions and trademark

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,840
questions over time we made our way

00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:52,270
through 2011 kind of bumping along and

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,349
then we got this sort of New Year's Day

00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:58,210
presents from Damien and I'm not gonna

00:04:56,349 --> 00:05:01,479
lie that was a kind of a punch to the

00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:03,460
gut right we poured a lot of energy at

00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:04,840
this point my company was three years in

00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,400
the making running a cloud service that

00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,520
really critically depended upon the

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,259
success of CouchDB and here is the

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,550
original projects founder coming in and

00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:14,050
saying this whole CouchDB thing it was

00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:17,229
great it was fun while it lasted you

00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:19,780
also come to couch base now right didn't

00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:21,729
feel good so we had sort of dueling blog

00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:25,030
posts and Twitter wars and stuff for a

00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:26,500
while and yeah I mean it kind of was you

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:30,000
know it was a little tough for a little

00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:33,669
while there but this is where I think

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,770
the the ASF really demonstrated the

00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:39,190
power that it does have and the staying

00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:41,050
power right the the installation of the

00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,120
Apache Way in the committers and the

00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,830
sort of you know us being able to fall

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,810
back on the position that hey we all

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,370
really are equal contributors to this

00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,719
project and one of the reasons we

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,080
brought this to Apache in the first

00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:54,909
place was so that if you know the the

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,740
otherwise be DFL should decide that for

00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:59,229
life had a different interpretation that

00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:02,830
the project could move forward the

00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:05,080
project could survive so we took you

00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:08,169
know encouragement in that and this was

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,090
also a time where I think some of us

00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:12,669
recognized that our role as members of

00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,409
the PMC needed to evolve originally the

00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:16,240
PMC was sort of the uber hackers right

00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:17,800
the ones who fundamentally were the ones

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,120
you trusted to modify the v3 if it

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:24,819
needed to be modified but as time moved

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,349
on we recognized that we needed to play

00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:28,000
a different role we needed to be the

00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:30,190
ones who are fostering more of a

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,130
community and we needed to be the ones

00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:34,839
who were encouraging more contributions

00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,330
from abroad or a more diverse group of

00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:39,689
people if the project was going

00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:41,789
be able to thrive long term that was a

00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:43,050
big sort I think fundamental recognition

00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:44,400
you know that we sort of had this

00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,439
internal discussion and said hey we're

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,599
kind of doing it wrong here we used to

00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,729
think about a commitment as something

00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:51,960
that was boy can we trust that this

00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:53,759
person is going to be around for the

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,409
long term are we really ready to kind of

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,379
bring them into the fold and what's the

00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:59,909
wrong way to think about it when we when

00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:02,520
we instead said now the commitment is

00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:05,039
just us placing our trust in this person

00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,919
to help set the direction for the

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,469
project we started to give them out more

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,569
frequently give them out in a more sort

00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:13,949
of broad setting not just people who

00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:15,300
were hacking on the core code but people

00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:17,879
who are writing documentation sure

00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,169
that's a commitment and that I think was

00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:20,580
really powerful you started to see the

00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:22,159
committers grow and you started to see

00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,360
people who might have been on the edge

00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:26,370
about whether they wanted to be engaged

00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,539
in the project that commitment was hey

00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,210
that was the thing that was the

00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:33,810
encouragement that they needed to become

00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:36,020
more full-fledged contributors another

00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:38,310
thing that happened in this sort of

00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:41,210
rollercoaster period throughout 2012 and

00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:43,229
2013 we started thinking more

00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,639
assertively about what it meant to be a

00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:47,639
member of the community we drafted a

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,830
code of conduct and you know put that

00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,090
through its revisions had it edited you

00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,830
know on behalf of the community and

00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,990
published that for the couch TV project

00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,580
my understanding is that was

00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,229
subsequently adopted in large form you

00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,960
know by the foundation as a whole so I'm

00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:03,930
really happy to see that so that was a

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,879
real maturation time for the project

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,139
there wasn't all that much happening in

00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:08,580
the code base at this point in time we

00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,259
were adding small features and fixing

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,520
bugs and sort of point releases we're

00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:14,009
starting to get a little further apart

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,509
but we had new foundations for a more

00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:17,819
scalable community going forward and

00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:19,620
that's when we started to say okay I

00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:21,810
think we've got a community in place

00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,159
where we can really kickstart new

00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:28,319
activity and a new release in the

00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:31,379
project right and then my company got

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,789
acquired and it was another round of

00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,870
sort of what does this mean for the

00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:36,060
project what does this mean for the

00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:38,159
company and I mean I certainly had these

00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,500
discussions with IBM as we were going to

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,360
the due diligence about what the future

00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,740
of our contributions to the Apache

00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,490
project was going to be and I was

00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:49,440
assured by my sort of counterparts that

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,449
no no it'll be good

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,790
we're wholly supportive of the ASF look

00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:55,019
we're practically you know we've been in

00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,850
there since the beginning we contribute

00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:58,649
to all kinds of projects you should feel

00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,079
you know rest assured that we want you

00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:04,829
to contribute you know just as much as

00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:06,149
you have been said okay still there's a

00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:07,529
lot of consternation about what this is

00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:10,410
going to mean with joining this massive

00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:12,089
corporation but sure enough I mean I

00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,939
have to tip my hat to you and I think

00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:16,680
that if anything our pace of

00:09:14,939 --> 00:09:18,149
contribution is accelerated we didn't

00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,459
feel as much of a need to sort of have a

00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:21,959
big existential discussion about each

00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,339
contribution and say well is this too

00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,870
much are we holding back things that we

00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:27,480
need to hold back it really became a

00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:30,149
very authentic like bring it into Apache

00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,740
our value is the cloud platform right we

00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:33,720
can go and authentically contribute just

00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:37,079
about everything that we do in to the

00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,759
Apache project and since then I think

00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:40,740
things have been on the upswing I'm very

00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:42,449
happy that you know my colleagues my

00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,250
friends over at the the neighborhood er

00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:45,600
you know now formalizing the work

00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,339
they've been doing for the project and

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,220
they are doing fantastic things in the

00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:53,790
offline first movement and are I think

00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:55,769
people I still look to as sort of truly

00:09:53,790 --> 00:10:00,089
leaders in what it means to foster an

00:09:55,769 --> 00:10:02,550
active diverse independent community and

00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:05,250
together we spent the better part of

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:07,620
last year in a very sort of significant

00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,350
Herculean effort I think sometimes to

00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,870
get the to audio release out the door

00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:14,490
this represented you know almost five

00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,800
years worth of development at this point

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,689
and lots of new functionality new

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,600
branding new messaging new documentation

00:10:18,689 --> 00:10:23,329
new you eyes I mean this is not how a to

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,769
auto release is supposed to happen but

00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:27,959
it happened it's out the door now and

00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:29,610
you know the the project I think is on a

00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,689
great and healthy trajectory and I'm

00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,809
really really happy about it

00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:36,029
so let's recap we had the departure of a

00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:37,110
project sounder we had a company

00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:39,480
sponsoring the majority of the

00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,800
committers getting acquired and just for

00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,360
good measure we had more than five years

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,759
in between major releases any one of

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,759
these things could be fatal I think for

00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:49,199
a typical open source project and I

00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:50,490
really do think it's a testament to the

00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:51,930
Apache Software Foundation and the

00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,019
support that's been provided that we are

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:57,389
here and we're stronger than ever

00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:59,009
so I'm excited about that and I BM is -

00:10:57,389 --> 00:11:01,370
and it's one of the reasons that you

00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:03,020
know certainly in addition to CouchDB

00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,550
we bring lots of projects and lots of

00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,710
contributions to the Apache Software

00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:08,720
Foundation ones that are already here

00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:12,350
and new ones like our open whisk

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,570
functions as a service project and this

00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,280
was basically a research effort

00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:17,390
incubated within IBM and we said well if

00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,190
this is going to be successful as an

00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:21,470
open source project we need to bring it

00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:25,090
to a community we needed to have its own

00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:27,890
sort of legs independent of our own RMP

00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:29,420
and of course our contributions to

00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:31,010
things like Apache spark and the broader

00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,510
Big Data stack will be established a

00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:34,040
spark Technology Center for people to

00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:36,200
contribute directly to the project in

00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:39,400
service of you know things like my

00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:42,500
Watson data platform and many many more

00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:46,100
you know in the big data stack and

00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,810
outside Apache has become really a ideal

00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,690
destination for a lot of our efforts and

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:53,030
I you know I feel for Sam and the board

00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:54,710
and in managing the velocity of new pod

00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:56,270
Lang's that are coming in and I know

00:11:54,710 --> 00:12:01,490
that we're responsible for a non-trivial

00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:03,650
chunk of that so you know with that I

00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,540
hope you've enjoyed this sort of journey

00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,920
through one project experience and

00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,740
maturation within the Apache Software

00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:12,440
Foundation I hope you all have an

00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,360
awesome conference and I'm really

00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,560
excited to spend the time with you thank

00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:20,860
you

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,860
