Description: 
	A Tale of Two Developers: Finding Harmony Between Commercial Software Development and the Apache Way - Andrew Wang & Alex Leblang, Cloudera

Apache community members can reference tenets from the Apache Way such as “community over code” and “openness” as if it were second nature. While they may sound simple, these concepts can be foreign to developers coming to open source for the first time. Success as an Apache contributor stresses skills not emphasized in other types of software development, including reconciling the requirements of the upstream development process with the realities of running a commercial software business.

With the assistance of choreographed Socratic dialogue, our two protagonists, an experienced Apache committer and an enthusiastic young gun contributor, explore the tensions of working on an Apache project as employees of a for-profit company. The audience will learn practical advice and problem solving techniques for working effectively as part of an Apache community. By the end, our greenhorn comes to understand that the yin and yang of commercial software development and the Apache Way can exist in harmony.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,190
alright let's get started today Alex and

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,560
I are speaking about the Apache way but

00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,910
with a twist so the Apache way was

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,650
really developed back when most

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,620
open-source contributors were hobbyists

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,509
and volunteers but today Apache is a

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,100
very different competition it's still

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,199
very community oriented but most Apache

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,910
contributors are no longer volunteers

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,160
and are instead pay to contribute

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,600
full-time that's refer both myself and

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,640
Alex we work at Cloudera

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,519
a company that is commercializing Apache

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,289
big data projects so when business is

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,910
introduced to a project the narrative

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,280
changes there can be tension between

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,410
business needs and the needs of the

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,930
open-source community and that tension

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,270
is we want to address in our talk

00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:44,210
however we also thought why should

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,730
education come at the expense of

00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:49,590
engagement as a fun device we have

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,020
structured our content around three

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,170
we're calling them structured Socratic

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,640
dialogues featuring fictionalized

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,260
versions of ourselves

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,390
and these sort of conversations actually

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,910
came out of lunchtime discussions that

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,220
we had had I started at Cloudera working

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,360
on Apollo before it was ASF and then on

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,610
these other projects and then I switched

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,049
stage space and I was kind of like wait

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,619
so why do we bother with this what's

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:16,409
what's the deal um so andrew was going

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,939
to walk me through the next one we

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,310
introduced the value of open-source the

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,890
ASF the tenets of the Apache way in act

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,150
2 we show how the Apache Way applies to

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,740
some real-life scenarios

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,110
based on our experiences working in the

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,090
community and in act 3 the conclusion

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,780
the student applies the lessons learned

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,920
in act 1 and 2 to save the project

00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,869
so as you save questions in the end

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,540
because some concepts that we introduce

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:41,310
we sort of expand on further so don't

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,229
accuse F of screwing stuff up until

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,409
you've seen the whole thing then accuse

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,409
away

00:01:53,149 --> 00:02:00,330
act 1 Andrew and Alex are both employed

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,799
at Miss Sarah a companies of a bride

00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,229
commercial support for the Apache

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,420
project big dupe which does analytics

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:07,770
and storage on next-generation mist

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,929
computing infrastructure

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,180
andrew is a grizzled veteran of open

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,890
source an Apache Alex is a newcomer to

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,989
open source but not the software

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:20,849
development alex was recently hired to

00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:21,360
work on a new big do feature rainfall hi

00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,720
Alex

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,920
how's your first week going great I

00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,860
really like everyone I've met so far

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,120
miss Dara people are very friendly

00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,560
thanks for helping me get my laptop set

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,000
up I've started talking around the

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,340
codebase and looking at some of the

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,319
issues you pointed me to great to hear

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,180
we're glad you joined as I'm sure you

00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,860
know this is a fast-moving space and

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,200
we've really well and get rainfall in

00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,000
but I don't want us to go out just yet I

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,100
decide this time to get your first

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,110
passionate upstream before we get

00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,620
started giving you questions actually

00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,690
yeah

00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,760
dig deep is my first time working on an

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,739
open-source project I'll be honest I

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,290
don't really get why we do it here I

00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:00,239
know that Linux and Firefox and things

00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,739
like that have done well but we could

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,660
really get things done faster and easier

00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,760
if we just forked big doop and worked on

00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,590
it ourselves asking a big question

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,880
straight off we're forced to work at

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,430
that company where our management

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,140
believes in the value of open source the

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,359
misty review point the open source

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,489
community acts as a force multiplier

00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:19,230
Big D benefits from features and fixes

00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,970
contribute by people out to the company

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,829
we should be working on cloud computing

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,989
not miss computing or whatever for open

00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:27,150
source it's cool that we get these

00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:28,410
improvements for free but why do we

00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,319
bother to submit our changes back

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,280
upstream if we kept them to ourselves

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,560
then our project would be better than

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,690
the open source version well it's all

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,940
about maintaining a healthy open source

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,690
community if everyone only took and

00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,700
never came back

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,920
gave back to the upstream project the

00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,690
project would wither and die so by being

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,519
active upstream and welcoming new

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,069
contributors we build momentum behind

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,510
the project remember miss Tara is

00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,040
competing mainly against proprietary

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,049
Zagreb and there's not other big

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,850
distributors our first priority is

00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:59,639
getting big deep out there into the

00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:02,310
hands of more users ok and big doop is

00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:03,360
part of apache right I guess this is my

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,130
inexperience and oh

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,360
showing but that's different from

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:11,670
Eclipse and Firefox yeah it is formally

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,140
the ASF is a nonprofit that supports the

00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,570
development of the apache family of

00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,010
open-source projects one distinction is

00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,320
that all patchy software is distributed

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,820
under the Apache License which is more

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,640
permissive and other open source

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,430
licenses another distinction is that the

00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,890
SS is a volunteer run organization

00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:30,510
corporations cannot buy influence how

00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:33,660
does all that relate to building

00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:35,310
communities well the a set is basically

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,840
a group of developers a lot of

00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,670
experience in forming healthy

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,040
open-source communities the patchy

00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,600
license and governance model to essa for

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,940
all drawn from that experience

00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,410
for instance the patchy license allow

00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,510
people to include a patchy code and

00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,400
proprietary products isn't that the

00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,140
opposite of open-source letting people

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,690
use open source code and proprietary

00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,880
projects it sounds counterintuitive but

00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:59,490
a more permissive license actually means

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,200
a more inclusive community it encourages

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,390
businesses to make Apache software at

00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,830
the core of their product and allow them

00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,810
to participate in the community and

00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:08,190
contribute or changes upstream I guess

00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,280
that's why we're here working on big

00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:13,560
dupe side yep I also need to add another

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,510
point on community building the ASF has

00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,669
a lot of tribal knowledge around how to

00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:20,250
build open-source communities this is

00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:22,200
captured in the Apache way a set of high

00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,570
level principles like community / code

00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,100
and meritocracy which people refer to

00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:29,190
when interacting in Apache and making

00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,660
project decisions okay I get that but it

00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,430
still seems like a lot of work to

00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,500
contribute upstream for instance as a

00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,060
newcomer I can't get my changes in since

00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,270
I'm not a big Duke committer if we

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:41,400
forked I can start committing right now

00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:43,950
that's true and it's valid concern

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,050
there's a ramp up to getting involved in

00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:48,590
a new project and gets back to those key

00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:51,060
principles of the apache way I mentioned

00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:52,770
meritocracy means that new contributors

00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,500
earn additional rights through

00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:58,190
demonstrating merit after that the PMC

00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,960
might make you a committer ah merit that

00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,940
sounds like what I need yeah that's the

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,570
benefit of working at massara having

00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:09,060
that sweet sweet merit what what well

00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:11,040
and I thank you for this you guys have

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,410
built up a lot of merit for us so I

00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,080
guess I can just see why we don't need a

00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,040
fork the project maybe I should get a

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,110
get a badge next

00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,210
my name when I post my first patches so

00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,250
people know that I have merit a merit

00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:26,480
badge so to speak like a regular Eagle

00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:29,250
Scout that's not really how this works

00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,590
merit is earned by individuals not by

00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,540
companies well miss Taryn has a big

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,070
investment in big doop I know we have a

00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,080
big team supporting this project for our

00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:39,870
customers isn't that worth something

00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,030
it is mr. brings a lot to the Apache

00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,770
community the most obvious of which is

00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:46,440
paying full-time developers to work on

00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,910
the project also having customers means

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,280
we really understand the pain points of

00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,770
big deep users which helps us guide the

00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,660
direction of the project finally miss

00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:57,060
Tara also helps evangelize Apache

00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,670
projects by sponsoring conferences and

00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:02,280
meetups so as a developer miss Tara I

00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:05,100
can earn big Duke Mara bears by

00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,600
contributing patches exactly just

00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,820
working at mitts Tara doesn't grant you

00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,650
any special privileges but you sara

00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,090
employees can earn merit on an

00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:14,940
individual basis through their

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:17,730
contributions okay so the meritocracy

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,690
thing sounds good in theory but I still

00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:21,180
don't get how it works in practice

00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:22,920
people know that you work for Miss Tara

00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,780
are they supposed to pretend that you

00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,510
don't and I know that some Apache

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,430
projects are like 99% controlled by a

00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,930
single company or there's a Linux like

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,120
situation where the project is

00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,280
controlled by a single person how does

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,300
this all work

00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:41,610
hats hats hats so people have passed you

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,140
often talk about hats when working on

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,110
patchy project we're supposed to wear

00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:48,420
our Apache hat rather than our company

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:52,020
had this means acting with a project's

00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:54,120
best interests in mind people really act

00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,250
altruistically like that I better

00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,960
competitors would block me from being a

00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,210
committer just because I work in Miss

00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,220
Sarah after all if they control the

00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:05,550
project they can block our changes I

00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:07,950
also always see companies publishing

00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,840
press releases bragging about how many

00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,700
big Duke committers they have or how

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,020
much codes have contributed so if they

00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,660
control the project they can make

00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:18,000
themselves look good do you think it's a

00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,650
good idea for our competitors to block

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,780
our exchanges yeah

00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:24,660
obviously we need to ship this rainfall

00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:27,570
feature ASAP if they start messing with

00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,530
us we'll miss our deadline but what does

00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,870
that mean from a community perspective

00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:33,420
that blocking our changes make it

00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:34,290
more or less like ways that will work

00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,510
with them in the future

00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:38,610
mmm you're alluding to the value of open

00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:40,170
source if they're being difficult

00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,460
we might take our ball and go home and

00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:44,490
then they won't benefit from our

00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,080
contributions yeah there are always

00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,670
drugs on the internet but the vast

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,830
majority of people are patchy just want

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,330
to make their project better okay so

00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:54,240
hats are a metaphor for thinking about

00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:56,250
the community first exactly and that's

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,760
really the essence of the Apache Way

00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:01,860
community over code now are you ready to

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,110
working on that first patch I came here

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:13,050
to crush code into bubblegum and I'm on

00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:16,580
a lot of big league chew okay so what do

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:18,990
we cover in Act one the first topic is

00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:21,600
what is the value of open source from a

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:24,420
corporate perspective so open source

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,790
acts as a force multiplier this means

00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,550
that you benefit from the changes and

00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,960
improvements being contributed by other

00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,300
members of the open source community

00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:37,440
besides ourselves to get a lot more work

00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:40,140
done you get a lot more push behind your

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,930
project from a business perspective also

00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:45,240
a rising tide lifts all boats we alluded

00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:47,130
to this in act 1 when we said that

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,600
oftentimes your competitor is not

00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,640
another distributor of that same patchy

00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,170
project it's often sometimes other to

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,630
software entirely perhaps a sort of a

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:57,260
propriety piece of software so focusing

00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:59,370
on just growing your apache community

00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:02,370
benefits everyone who contributes to

00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:04,410
that community finally from a customer

00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,240
business point of view oftentimes

00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,310
customers like open source because it

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,900
means reduced lock-in they have

00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,820
alternatives they want someone else to

00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,550
support this same piece of software for

00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:17,000
them and oftentimes open source also

00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:19,410
comes hand-in-hand with open standards

00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,820
so what about for the individual

00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,550
contributors the employees of the

00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,170
companies one of the benefits is you get

00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,310
to work with a global community which is

00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,750
much more than you could say in most

00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,900
companies if you're just working with

00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,130
your co-workers who sit next to you

00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:35,520
you'll get a public record of your work

00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:36,630
which again is sort of a rare thing if

00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,830
you're working on some proprietary

00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,140
software no one will ever see what you

00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:42,060
did so you can't really prove that you

00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,890
did anything or good at your job at all

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,779
um

00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:48,180
and you get to attend Apache con in

00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:52,589
exciting locales like Miami so that's

00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:54,959
that's a nice benefit okay and the next

00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:58,649
topic we covered is why the ASF in

00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:01,529
particular and what is the is so the a

00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:03,660
SS mission is to support the development

00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:06,390
of the Apache family of open-source

00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:08,279
projects and it's different from some

00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:10,920
other open-source foundations and that

00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:12,089
it is independent it's fully not run by

00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,100
corporate interests which means you

00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:19,649
cannot pay Apache some amount of money

00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:21,180
and get control in the ASF and lastly

00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:23,579
one of the probably the biggest

00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,230
percentage ASF is that know we've been

00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:27,690
growing open-source communities for a

00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,070
very long time if you lot of tribal

00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:31,440
knowledge about how to do that

00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:38,279
successfully which is encoded in the

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:40,649
Apache way so one of the key takeaways

00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:42,750
of Act one in terms of how to interact

00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:45,779
with the Apache community community over

00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:47,010
code and obviously we're going expand on

00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,870
this in the next two acts but the

00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:51,329
upstream contributors are your community

00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:53,010
so it's very important to build

00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:55,320
interpersonal relationships with them

00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,670
the people upstream not just people who

00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,350
work at your company who have to be

00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:02,339
working on the same project yeah next is

00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:05,339
meritocracy the idea that individuals

00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:07,800
not corporations can earn merit through

00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:10,709
their contributions to the project and

00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,060
by demonstrating merit you are given

00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:14,010
increased responsibilities in the

00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,690
project going from you know committer or

00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:19,440
start from contributor to committed to

00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:21,839
PMC member so on so forth and we touched

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,279
on the concept of hats which is it's

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,800
important to keep the project's best

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,730
interest in mind

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,940
even when you're dealing with people you

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:32,190
may interact with outside of the Apache

00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,140
hat world when you're dealing with

00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:37,320
Apache you're wearing the Apache hat

00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:39,600
yeah I remember all of these tents of

00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,579
the Apache way are drawn from the

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,100
experience of caen growing successful

00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:46,769
healthy open-source communities so we'll

00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,269
be going over in more depth why each of

00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:51,510
these points is important and how we

00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:53,589
relate to more real-world examples in

00:12:51,510 --> 00:13:03,140
act 2

00:12:53,589 --> 00:13:04,850
good character okay act two four months

00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,970
have passed since Alex our that miss

00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:10,279
taro he done law bug fixes and new law

00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:12,920
progress on big feature rainfall

00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:14,630
however Alice's having upstream issues

00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:18,290
with his patch and comes to Andrew for

00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:21,589
advice hey Andrew do you have a minute

00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:23,959
sure what's up well I finally posted my

00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:26,149
patch for a rainfall upstream I've been

00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:27,860
working on this for a long time and I

00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:29,779
even got to reviewed by some of our

00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,880
teammates first internally they said it

00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:33,649
looked good to go so the upstream review

00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,600
should have just been a formality but

00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:36,740
some clown minus one did and now I'm

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,959
stuck

00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:42,140
well upstream reviews aren't really a

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:44,269
formality look Andrew when we need to

00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:46,220
get this in pronto our product manager

00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:46,610
already promises to our customers months

00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,800
ago

00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:50,750
just yesterday mellon told everyone

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,010
would have it upstream by Friday for the

00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,620
relief come on

00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:56,870
can you do something we're all on the

00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,850
same team here whoa whoa okay let's slow

00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,350
this down a little bit this internal

00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,209
deadline sounds like it's stressing you

00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:04,399
out but let's worry about the codes

00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:05,720
first I haven't even seen your patch yet

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,240
but I'm sure I can figure out this veto

00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,980
I don't know can't you just commit it

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,310
for me you've been working on big dupe

00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:15,019
for a while people listen to you sorry

00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,899
Alex why interact with the big dude

00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:18,079
community I need to wear my Apache hat

00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:21,199
amen

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:23,630
no disrespect I vaguely remember your

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,190
intro advice from the first day but I'm

00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,810
not in the mood for this hat BS right

00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,610
now I'm trying to be a mover and a

00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,149
shaker not some hippie on a hill with a

00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:33,260
pilothouse

00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:35,570
I admit that a hats are bit silly but I

00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,880
meant what I said I need to think of the

00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:41,390
project first it's important look at the

00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:43,370
long term hear the long term I know this

00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:45,140
is your first big project so it's teams

00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:46,880
really important to think about your

00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:49,519
next project and the one out there that

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,709
we need to build consensus first not RAM

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,300
to change down people's throats that's

00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:55,180
not the way to build good relationships

00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:59,269
with the rest of the big dude community

00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:01,279
yeah I mean I know that but look this is

00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:02,930
a one-time thing we were behind the

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,910
eight ball on rainfall and everyone up

00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:06,529
to our VP expects this is going to be

00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:08,629
shipped in our next release

00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:11,449
I swear I'll do it better next time help

00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:14,720
a co-worker out well even if I wanted to

00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:16,639
I can't override a veto really but

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,620
aren't you a PMC member this guy

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,459
upstream is only a committer you don't

00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:25,009
outrank him well yet yes but no I'm not

00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:27,199
dictator and even though I'm on the PMC

00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:29,029
I I can't write a code veto the

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,069
influence I have comes merrily from my

00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:33,110
interpersonal relationships not from

00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:36,079
being a PMT member so what's the point

00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:37,879
of being on the PMC then well I'm

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,439
responsible for making project level

00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:41,089
decisions and looking after the

00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,370
long-term health of the project I'll

00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:45,230
also add that part I'd be a good PMC

00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:48,439
member is knowing to pick your battles

00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:49,699
well so what should I do now well let's

00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:53,629
look at your patch together I hadn't

00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:55,309
even seen yet ten minutes later dude

00:15:53,629 --> 00:15:58,309
that's a lot of history on axe over was

00:15:55,309 --> 00:16:00,319
not really a big deal yeah and I guess

00:15:58,309 --> 00:16:03,170
the code is a little cleaner too so now

00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:04,399
that we're done can you commit it well

00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,339
no not quite yet

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,649
you need a poster patch first and wait

00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:11,360
for the community to review it but you

00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:13,160
just signed off on this I thought we

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,350
addressed everyone's concerns and I

00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,029
didn't even ask you to do it as a PMC

00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,759
member I just came to you as a fellow

00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:21,670
developer but we were the only ones here

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,559
what do you want me to invite my mother

00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:26,839
funny but but no what I meant was that

00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:29,149
this discussion did not happen on a

00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:31,100
public list yeah I mean it just seemed

00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:33,379
easier to come talk to you you sit

00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:36,860
nearby and we were able to get it done

00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:38,809
quickly and I was happy to help but me

00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,519
the first build community consensus and

00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:42,949
part of that is having a public record

00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:45,259
for how the decision was made it makes

00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:46,879
it transparent why decision was made and

00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:48,699
ensure that everyone in the Big D

00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:49,939
community can make their opinion heard

00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:51,920
yes

00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:53,179
that's been made clear and I guess there

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,009
are different people in different time

00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:57,379
zones who might also want to comment

00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:59,629
okay I'll post my patch with a comment

00:16:57,379 --> 00:17:03,259
about hide rest the code review comments

00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:05,179
thanks for your help no problem oh and

00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:06,799
did you see this latest dev thread

00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:08,630
they're trying to make Danny the docks

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,539
rider a committer what a joke

00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:13,669
what was that joke I'm not even a

00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:16,089
committer true but I mean you guys are

00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:18,530
different people he just writes

00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:19,809
documentation right it's not like he's

00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,850
writing code

00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:23,259
people can't even read code Danny's

00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:26,470
always asking me questions about how

00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:29,259
rainfall works didn't Denny overhaul our

00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:31,090
user guide yeah and didn't he also

00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:35,019
convert all our Docs from XML to

00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:39,269
markdown yeah and didn't Denny also

00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:41,200
write all the docs for rainfall so so

00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:44,289
why do you feel he shouldn't be a

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,669
committer it's just Doc's writing code

00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:47,499
is way harder than running dogs

00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:49,840
I spend months working on rainfall and

00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:51,539
Danny wrote the docs is like a week any

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,610
developer can write Docs if they want to

00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:56,769
let's step back for a second if you were

00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:58,330
a user and wanted to try out rainfall

00:17:56,769 --> 00:18:00,999
what's the first thing you do you

00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:03,129
probably google Big D rainfall in the

00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:05,080
big deep docs would be the first hit so

00:18:03,129 --> 00:18:07,869
Doc's are the first exposure a user has

00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,070
to our project and their new features ok

00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:11,320
point to you

00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,399
I agree the docs are useful and to be

00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,350
honest I get annoyed when I'm

00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:17,139
researching a new technology and there

00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:19,899
aren't any Doc's but still Danny only

00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:21,730
has 10 patches I have 20 patches and I'm

00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:24,129
still not a committer how's that fair

00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:26,289
well let's redo this email that's

00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:28,029
proposing Denny as a committer it says

00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:30,129
that Denny has been involved the project

00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:32,249
for a long time and yucky guys start by

00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:34,330
answering questions on the user list and

00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:36,399
looking at the archives he's actually

00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,840
the top poster of all time that means he

00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:38,409
talked a lot of people get started with

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,110
big goop

00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:43,720
but let's still not code and it doesn't

00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:46,720
have to be remember patchy Merritt takes

00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,610
many forms there's no one route to

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,080
commit ership if anything it's

00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:52,809
embarrassing that because this long made

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,549
any of a committer at all I mean I

00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:57,879
thought all this Merritt stuff was built

00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:59,740
by building the project code speaks so

00:18:57,879 --> 00:19:02,919
Kathy and quality can become a committer

00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:05,080
by writing tests sure and Frank the

00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:07,330
program manager his job is setting

00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,070
target versions for Gira's and doing

00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,990
really scheduling he can become a

00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:13,210
committer no reason why not

00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:15,700
why just break even need to commit bit

00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:18,820
doesn't need to commit to code to do

00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:21,279
program managing well this is one of the

00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,110
weaknesses of the Apache system maybe

00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:24,970
Frank never used to commit to the repo

00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:27,279
but we'd certainly like Frank be helping

00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,929
with releases I'd make think a PMC

00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,000
member just so he gets a binding a vote

00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:32,919
on releases this seems to violate the

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,730
principle of least privilege people

00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:36,280
shouldn't have

00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,840
that they don't need sure like I said

00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,400
this is one of the weaknesses of the

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,340
Apache governance model it's very

00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,950
developer centric but let's think of it

00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,870
this way even if Frank doesn't need to

00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:49,450
commit to the repo would we still trust

00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:51,040
him to use his power responsibly I guess

00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:52,870
I mean I don't think Frank would ever

00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,340
commit any code which is why I thought

00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:56,740
it goofy that he would become a

00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,750
committer in the first place so in

00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:01,210
practice it's fine something else I've

00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,500
learned is that code is just code it can

00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:04,690
always be changed later

00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,340
so rather we not worry about possible

00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:08,950
gets corruption and said focus on

00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:11,740
growing our community so what should i

00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:13,450
do then I've done a lot of patches yeah

00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,610
you've done a lot of heavy lifting on

00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:17,800
rainfall the pmc typically looks for

00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:20,170
someone who's who has a history of

00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:22,500
sustained high quality contributions and

00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:24,700
I think you meet both of those bars so

00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:28,450
what do I need to do to become a

00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:29,680
committer well again my advice is to

00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,210
make sustained high-quality

00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,560
contributions since we're developers

00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,390
that means making good patches and doing

00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,680
good code reviews wait so even though

00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:38,830
I'm not a committer I should still do

00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,550
code reviews definitely the best way to

00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,530
become a committer

00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:43,420
is to act like looks like a committer

00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:44,770
the primary responsibility of a

00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:48,280
committer is reviewing other people's

00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:49,210
patches and giving it a plus-one so the

00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,920
best way of showing that everybody

00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,520
forgets responsibility is by doing more

00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,980
code review

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,660
I guess ideally that makes sense but I'm

00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,100
really busy with rainfall we're on a

00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:00,400
tight timeline I'd rather be writing

00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:02,470
code than paying virtual dues it comes

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,790
to the territory I mean the command

00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,010
committer is also about building those

00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:07,090
community relationships this isn't

00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:09,250
really that different from starting work

00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,930
on onion you codebase you never just go

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,330
in and change everything on active

00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:14,950
project first you need to build

00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:16,870
credibility the people who are already

00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,580
there okay I'll try already doing more

00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,930
code there's this cool cloud burst

00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,570
feature some other people are working on

00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:25,150
maybe I can review some of those patches

00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:26,860
good and a silver lining of this veto is

00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:29,890
that it might actually be a good

00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:31,690
opportunity to work positively within

00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:33,310
the community if you can show you can

00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,810
work constructively with our upstream

00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:37,600
your viewer and get him to remove the

00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:39,130
veto that's a big step forward you can

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,930
also try more actively engaging with

00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,820
people on the mailing lists and enjoy

00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:44,740
discussions so people can get to know

00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:46,300
you okay I guess I could start a

00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,590
discussion on the dev list about when we

00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,570
want to rebase rainfall

00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:50,770
good idea and I've been wondering how

00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,340
we're going to get rainfall to work with

00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,560
cloudburst

00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,090
I should think those developers too now

00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,460
are thinking with portals all right I

00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:59,230
can run with this sustained high-quality

00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,240
contributions and positive interactions

00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:04,180
with the community thanks again for all

00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,400
the help anytime by the way you see the

00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:07,780
zero this guy John filed he's new to the

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,690
project but he wants to add some Python

00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:19,300
the big doof weight Python and big cube

00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:21,550
I'd take a walk ok ok so discussion

00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:24,010
questions for act 2

00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:26,770
what mistakes would Alex make with his

00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:28,990
first patch well instead of engaging

00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:32,440
with the community early I did a giant

00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:34,330
code dump which is not good and as a

00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,010
result I received the upstream veto

00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:38,610
which would have been expected had my

00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:42,250
character know anything about Apache

00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:44,350
another mistake was letting internal

00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:47,140
pressure sort of dictate my reactions

00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:48,520
people have stream obviously aren't

00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,590
aware of your company's internal

00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,630
deadlines they don't care about your

00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:53,770
company's internal deadlines and they

00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:55,990
shouldn't care about your company's

00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:57,850
internal deadlines the project sets

00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,140
their own sort of timelines for releases

00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,970
and when they want to get things in and

00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:03,300
from the Patrick father's perspective

00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:06,910
those are the only ones that matter

00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:11,650
right and so what did we see in terms of

00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:13,630
complication strategies in act 2 so one

00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:16,000
of the things there build consensus by

00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:18,100
pulling in others in this case was sort

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,070
of easier because I worked alongside a

00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:23,650
senior member of the project so Andrew

00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:28,090
was able to help me through navigating

00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:29,200
the veto right and next is making sure

00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,640
you keep you the discussion about the

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,910
technical problem I mean you tell that

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,170
Alex is getting pretty frustrated he was

00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:37,480
unhappy with how things have played out

00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:39,760
but yeah we brought back to the code

00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,430
about the upstream review comments and

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,530
it turns out that if you can keep the

00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:46,960
discussion focus on the technical

00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:49,480
problem at hand oftentimes you can come

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,000
to a compromise solution that overall is

00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,590
barely started with often times yet you

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,420
can improve the contribution by

00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:57,420
incorporating everyone's feedback

00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:02,760
the next up we covered is how do you

00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:04,410
become a committer so this differs from

00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,600
project to project to community

00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:10,380
community some speaking in pretty

00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,790
general terms here but at least for many

00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:14,160
attached to I've seemed they look for

00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:17,640
basically these three things the first

00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:19,950
is high quality contributions this means

00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:23,460
when you post a pass and people trust it

00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:26,010
right you need good quality the next is

00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,870
a history of sustained contributions

00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:29,130
the idea behind kind of getting some of

00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:31,440
the commits this if you want them to

00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:33,960
then go on and work in the community to

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,050
go review other people's patches you

00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,540
know pulling more more contributors grow

00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:41,040
the project you want someone who is

00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,840
dedicated to the project who probably

00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,930
when you give them the scheme it bit

00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:48,180
they'll go on to do these things in the

00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:49,980
community and finally and probably

00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:53,310
actually most important is building

00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:55,710
interpersonal relationships Apache is a

00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:56,820
pretty flat model all said once you're

00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:59,100
committed you're pretty much fully

00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,650
functional as a member of the project

00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:06,350
for data operations so you really have

00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:09,090
to have some people skills to navigate

00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:12,000
things like vetoes or other causes that

00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:13,770
happen upstream also becoming a

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,450
committer is ultimately all about trust

00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:17,430
remember we had this example of Frank

00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:18,480
the program manager who might still make

00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:20,130
a committer because it's his

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,600
contribution to the project Frank

00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:24,000
doesn't need to commit code to the

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,940
repository but we trust him with his

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,200
power because we trust Frank and that's

00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,330
like the most important thing I think

00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,070
about being committed with the community

00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:36,090
trust you with this new responsibility

00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:37,740
to behave in a good manner so as also

00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:40,620
that gets into who can become a

00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:42,780
committer anyone theoretically could

00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:45,420
become a committer it's not just limited

00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,460
to people who write code on any project

00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,930
there's more there's more roles in just

00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:51,600
like straight developers obviously

00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:54,000
Apache grew from people developing code

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,960
but as projects can get mature more

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,700
roles expand and sort of the idea of

00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,760
committer

00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:04,200
maybe it's sort of a course model in

00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,460
terms of how you want to do things

00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,760
something we sort of touched on in the

00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:10,890
talk and again there's no one route to

00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,460
commit or ship it varies project a

00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:13,830
project

00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,960
and if even various person to person

00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:17,309
depending on the role yeah I think this

00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,710
is really something that we are still

00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:21,509
dealing with as a patchy community how

00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:24,179
to fit in these non developer roles

00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:25,679
incorporate them I pull people in we

00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:28,139
actually had this very explicit

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,759
discussion on this topic on the hadoop

00:26:28,139 --> 00:26:32,549
list where we're talking about like hey

00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:34,139
you know basically we're all developers

00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,789
right we only have any Doc's writers or

00:26:34,139 --> 00:26:37,559
test people really people who are

00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:39,450
consuming these other roles are actually

00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:44,279
very important to the success of our

00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:45,690
project what can we do to try and pull

00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:47,519
more of these people in like and bring

00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,129
them into our community and make them

00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:52,739
feel rewarded and again right now the

00:26:50,129 --> 00:26:54,269
Apache model all we have is the look at

00:26:52,739 --> 00:26:57,299
the committer status or going becoming a

00:26:54,269 --> 00:26:59,190
PMC member so we actually tried to draft

00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:01,049
like a new set of committer criteria

00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:03,239
that gives examples for how these

00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:05,249
different types of roles can become a

00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:06,779
committed example for if you're like a

00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:09,330
test person how can you become a

00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:10,679
committer on hadoop if you are a doctor

00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:12,929
person how can you become committer on

00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:16,070
dupes so on so forth because we really

00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:19,499
are trying to incorporate these

00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:21,809
non-developer contributors into our

00:27:19,499 --> 00:27:23,070
hadoop community and I think this

00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:24,929
actually is also something that we can

00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:26,549
becomes more important as a project

00:27:24,929 --> 00:27:27,960
becomes more commercialized you know

00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:29,580
when starting off you have pretty

00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,499
sophisticated users who are on the

00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,969
bleeding edge of technology they're okay

00:27:31,499 --> 00:27:33,960
if your Doc's aren't accurate it's a

00:27:32,969 --> 00:27:35,789
little bit harder to use there's some

00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,249
sharp edges with your project but

00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:40,169
increasingly as you have a broader

00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:41,909
audience who's using your project it

00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:43,710
feels like doc seems like testing and

00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:45,299
quality become much much more important

00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:49,759
it's more important thinking about these

00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:49,759
non developer roles in your project

00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:01,980
so another thing we touched on is making

00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,670
decisions in a public forum if you work

00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,500
with a co-worker

00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:06,480
and you're working on the same project

00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,830
it's a patchy project we're not saying

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,150
don't talk to them about it that'd be

00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:11,040
ridiculous

00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:13,500
but if you're making any sort of project

00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,570
decisions or responding to code review

00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,610
comments you should always document that

00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:19,380
publicly so you want to make sure

00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:21,600
everyone can see why the decision was

00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:23,760
made and documenting and having

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,860
discussion publicly on the lists or in

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,630
JIRA or in a coder view allows everyone

00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,010
to participate and then sort of have

00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:31,200
ownership over the decision even if they

00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:32,490
don't chime in they'll see the decision

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,620
going on so they can feel like okay I

00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:36,360
saw this I know this is going on if I

00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:39,540
had a problem I could speak up and say

00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:41,880
wait why why are we doing this there's

00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:43,860
also a practicality because obviously

00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,260
everyone's distributed and oftentimes

00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,429
distributed across every time zone so

00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,870
people like you know sleeping when

00:28:47,429 --> 00:28:50,580
you're working in vice versa so you

00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:52,350
don't want to wake up and be like wait

00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:55,190
the whole project changed what's going

00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:57,510
on yeah so yeah this is all about

00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:59,940
lending community have ownership over

00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:03,809
this decisions are being made and that's

00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:06,059
achieved through transparency and one

00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:08,790
last point is that merits does not by

00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:10,620
Authority we talked about how TMT member

00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,730
is not out ranked emitters and if you're

00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,950
a-peein if you can't just go in

00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:16,200
overwrite a commuters veto it's not how

00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:17,730
this works so it's important to remember

00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,410
that you're going to suspect like

00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:22,620
against building the healthy open-source

00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:24,179
community it's important that even as a

00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,160
very senior member of the community

00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,600
member that every contributor has a

00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,880
voice you need work on a project for

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,720
many years some new person comments in

00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,020
it doesn't mean that they're necessarily

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,690
wrong right everyone has value they can

00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:38,400
add to the discussion just keep that in

00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:40,620
mind when you're doing interactions you

00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,940
know like even your PMT member you don't

00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,700
have a committer unit of your community

00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:49,679
on a bank a contributor everyone is part

00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:52,080
of that same open source community so

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,520
for X 3 we start with like the other

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,050
things going to cover and we end on a

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:59,130
dramatic flair just lead right into

00:29:55,050 --> 00:30:02,090
questions so the big takeaway room

00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:05,250
actually is going to be no jerks allowed

00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:07,810
Apache does not allow dictators but a

00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:09,190
single jerk can poison a project

00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:11,290
and rudeness needs to be addressed at

00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:13,510
the bud and this will actually will be a

00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:15,370
sort of a demonstration of that yeah

00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:18,310
and this is always a very difficult

00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:21,310
problem problem of you know bad apples

00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:22,960
basically exploding the entire barrel so

00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:25,510
no no there are no easy solutions here

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,310
but one thing I would say is that it's a

00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:28,660
responsibility of people who are more

00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:31,390
senior members of the community to

00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,980
address it you know your your job as a

00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,450
PMT member or committers to be thinking

00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:37,330
about the long-term health of the

00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:39,790
project so it's on you if you see

00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:41,350
rudeness to call it out and make sure

00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:44,050
you make it clear that it's not

00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:46,630
tolerated in your project and do this

00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,890
publicly and try and do it early and

00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,970
I'll see us back to you one of our

00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:51,160
earlier points about keeping the

00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:53,980
discussion about a technical problem

00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:56,080
that's at hand so rudeness and ad

00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:59,170
hominem attacks really have no place in

00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,450
a healthy project and of course again

00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:09,430
this is all gets back to building a

00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:12,310
healthy open-source community okay so

00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:14,670
acts three a year has passed since we

00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:16,690
last saw our protagonists Alex

00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:19,570
successfully completed rainfall and

00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:21,360
became a big duke emitter however big

00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:23,350
goop is now a shadow of its former self

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,800
community problems have spiraled out of

00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:27,280
control and the project isn't disarray

00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,620
contributions have slowed to a trickle

00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:32,200
and rumors that big dupes demise are

00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:34,270
circling the Twitterverse an attempt to

00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,270
say the project Alex approaches Andrew

00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:39,550
with a harsh truth hey Andrew I need to

00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:41,590
talk to you about something yeah sure

00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:43,600
what's up I'm concerned about the state

00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:45,160
of the project what are you talking

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,230
about the project is in better shape

00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,280
than ever you're still showing your

00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,990
inexperience man

00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:52,720
there are some things that are going on

00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:54,540
that look kind of problematic and I'm

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,730
not so new to this anymore

00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:59,890
like what code quality has definitely

00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:02,290
improved we used to have so many people

00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:05,350
committing these half-baked patches yeah

00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:07,270
to maybe even six months ago we had many

00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:09,730
individual contributors running code for

00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:11,950
the project and now look at how clean

00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:14,200
and precise all of our patches are we've

00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:16,240
committed the last six patches and in

00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,130
fact other than some commits from milena

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,320
and arune we have been running most of

00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,830
the code lately yeah you're right the

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,100
passion

00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:26,710
we have been really nice haven't they

00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:29,169
that's not what I'm saying so what's

00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:32,590
your point son didn't you already know

00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:34,720
milena and arune what milena and Arun

00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:37,659
you used to work with them right at your

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,820
previous job yeah there are great

00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:41,950
developers don't you see the problem

00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:44,230
there we aren't getting any new

00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:46,450
contributors no one wants to write code

00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:48,610
for big dupe anymore that's not the sign

00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:50,950
of a healthy project it doesn't matter

00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:53,110
right I mean people still on it well

00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:55,330
they do but I hear a lot of buzz about a

00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:57,820
big fire I heard they've gotten a ton of

00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:59,230
new contributors recently and many of

00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:01,779
those people continue to follow the

00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:04,570
project and contribute code who cares

00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:06,399
they're just a hot new thing and the

00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:09,730
general IT community we're much better

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:12,880
known and we control this project you

00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:16,570
mean you control the project yeah it's

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,519
great isn't it Andrew

00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:22,240
remember that guy John from a few months

00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:24,909
back yeah John that Python coder he

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:28,690
sucked he wasn't a bad developer just

00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:31,269
due to open source Hey look I got

00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:33,100
sentiment in here I'm not trying to

00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:35,590
teach every Tom Dick and Harry head

00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:37,899
about a for-loop you didn't even review

00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:40,179
his code you replied to his email to the

00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:41,710
dev list saying that you hate Python and

00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:43,899
that the project wasn't interested in

00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:48,010
accepting his patch let me find the

00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:50,169
thread look at this John sent an email

00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:52,000
to the list explaining that he wanted to

00:33:50,169 --> 00:33:54,880
add Python bindings to our project

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,950
here's your response honestly I don't

00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,779
see why we would need that our users are

00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,429
sophisticated computer operators and

00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:03,399
don't need to use Python as a crutch

00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:06,010
python has no place in our project then

00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:08,889
milena gave some constructive comments

00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:10,839
and asked him to file a JIRA John posted

00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:14,409
a design doc in a prototype patch and

00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:16,119
here's the comment you posted python is

00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:21,609
for mental midgets and it's not going to

00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:23,050
be associated with big dude yeah that

00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:25,520
was awesome

00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:28,639
pythons are mental midgets other sick

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,639
burn do what's wrong with you that was

00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,710
unprofessional and juvenile behavior

00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:36,020
come on then Python sucks young in a

00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:37,040
Python coders here in big Dube that's

00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:39,020
not even the point

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,240
John was interested in contributing too

00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,830
big Dube then you flamed him and he

00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,840
stopped participating in our community

00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:48,169
he started contributing to big fire and

00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:49,490
they loved him over there wait how do

00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:51,770
you know so much about this big fire

00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:53,929
project well they're doing some cool

00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:56,179
stuff over there I've been sending them

00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:58,099
a few patches here and there and the

00:34:56,179 --> 00:35:00,410
people are really helpful you've been

00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:02,599
contributing to big fire but we pay to

00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:05,300
work on big dude I thought you liked big

00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:09,260
dupe I've been tinkering in my free time

00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:12,109
more like a hobbyist really yeah

00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:13,609
honestly the big du project has really

00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:15,440
taken a turn for the worse people

00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:16,700
noticed how you treated John they

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,460
started taking their contributions

00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:21,140
elsewhere huh

00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:22,670
when I started at Miss Sarah how many

00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:25,250
upstream contributors did we have on big

00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:27,440
dips lots and that's why I had the clamp

00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:29,720
down there's all bad code being merged

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,300
and I couldn't review everything yeah

00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,040
but Andrew this gets back to one of the

00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,050
first things you taught me community

00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,030
over code we need to think about the

00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:41,510
long-term health of the project without

00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:44,150
contributors there is no project well we

00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:47,240
need good contributors contributors who

00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:49,030
sound good patches who do you think is

00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:52,790
going to be the next big dupe committer

00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:54,560
what I became a committer close to a

00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:57,619
year ago and I'm still the newest

00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:00,500
committer yeah because like I said there

00:35:57,619 --> 00:36:02,390
hasn't been anyone good recently Andrew

00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:05,030
let's link back to when I was working on

00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:07,070
rainfall I made plenty of mistakes heck

00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:08,510
I basically built a feature in a private

00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:11,210
branch before sending it upstream

00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:13,849
someone vetoed it and you had to help me

00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:16,280
rework it to address their feedback yeah

00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:18,800
but I knew you were cell developer you

00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,660
had potential but so did John before you

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,760
scared him off like I said he's been

00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:25,940
great over on big fire I think that just

00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:28,609
made him a committer I guess John might

00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:30,830
be alright then yeah but you didn't need

00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:32,210
to give him a chance Andrew do you

00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:33,400
remember why you got involved with open

00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:35,890
source

00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,729
well I enjoyed working with the open

00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:38,499
source community

00:36:36,729 --> 00:36:40,630
I was excited working on project like

00:36:38,499 --> 00:36:42,190
big groups I was popular that's changing

00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:44,710
the world me too

00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:47,200
when I started at massara you taught me

00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:49,509
about the Apache way about merit and

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,180
wearing my Apache hat and community

00:36:49,509 --> 00:36:54,069
overcoat you taught me that the project

00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:56,049
lives and dies by its community but I

00:36:54,069 --> 00:36:57,609
think you've lost sight of that big

00:36:56,049 --> 00:37:01,749
group is bigger than any one contributor

00:36:57,609 --> 00:37:03,489
even a contributor like you you're right

00:37:01,749 --> 00:37:06,729
I've forgotten what made me passionate

00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:08,890
about open source in the first place we

00:37:06,729 --> 00:37:09,849
can still save the project the community

00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:13,089
needs to come first

00:37:09,849 --> 00:37:15,369
that's something I learned from you Alex

00:37:13,089 --> 00:37:17,950
I can't thank you enough building

00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:20,410
consensus meritocracy diversity

00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:22,210
community over code I lost sight of

00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:25,089
these guiding principles and in the

00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:37,089
process I lost my way but maybe I can

00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:54,249
rediscover it the Apache wid so

00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:55,450
questions we just hit it ok because I am

00:37:54,249 --> 00:37:59,259
really impressed

00:37:55,450 --> 00:38:01,210
how hilarious and how many of the

00:37:59,259 --> 00:38:03,670
concepts I did touring if you have it

00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:07,029
all the other pathway dogs you have the

00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:09,880
exact concept in the context of the

00:38:07,029 --> 00:38:12,430
discussion and in you know of course an

00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,420
employee or a decoder is trying to do

00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:17,410
something in

00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:22,530
explaining the concept and right in how

00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:22,530
they need exiling here thank you

00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,920
thank you

00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,550
[Laughter]

00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:14,339
is that was to go as I said this it

00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:16,500
actually came up very organically

00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:18,030
because I I sorta came basically all

00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:23,730
these questions were questions that I

00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:25,280
had is like what is the deal yeah cool

00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:26,320
well thank you guys for coming

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:33,849
yeah

00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:33,849
