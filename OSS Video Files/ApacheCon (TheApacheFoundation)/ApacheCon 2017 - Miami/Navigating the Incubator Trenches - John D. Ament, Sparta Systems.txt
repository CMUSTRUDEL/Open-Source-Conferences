Description: 
	Navigating the Incubator Trenches - John D. Ament, Sparta Systems

It can be a daunting task to bring a new project to the Apache Software Foundation. But getting into the incubator and surviving incubation is a pretty easy task, when you know what to do and how to do it. In this session, I'll be giving an overview of incubation, pitfalls to watch out for, and how projects become successful. I'll also give an overview of the IPMC, how to interact with other podlings and make your mark on the ecosystem.

About John D. Ament
I'm a software architect for a company called Sparta Systems in Hamilton NJ. I'm highly active within Apache, and hope to use that experience to provide a great presentation about the Incubator.

so good morning everyone welcome to day

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:08,069
two of Apache : North America and the

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:13,320
wonderful heat of Miami I'm from Jersey

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:16,109
I don't like to eat so yeah I'll get

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,789
over it so I want to talk to you guys a

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:19,830
little bit about how to actually get out

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,480
of the incubator a lot of these talks

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,920
tend to focus on how to get projects

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,350
into the incubator we'll talk a little

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,390
bit about that but my main thing is once

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:31,529
you're in there how to get you out into

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:34,590
a successful top-level project so Who am

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:36,390
I I'm on github I'm on Twitter I got

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,850
started originally in a paddling called

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,219
Apache Delta spike which came from Red

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,579
Hat and some external contributors into

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:47,820
Apache my faces Cody and became its own

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:51,449
top-level project I learned the Apache

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,489
way through the incubator I was not an

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:56,640
existing member I am fairly new to

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,949
Apache from a organization standpoint I

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,270
started in 2011 and I would say for the

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:02,129
first year and a half I really didn't do

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,220
anything with Apache outside of work

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:08,040
within my project I've been able to grow

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:11,760
though work with ActiveMQ work with user

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,500
grid Juneau Maya area Tosca Pony mail

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,939
and bunch of other things as well some

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,290
stuff outside of the ASF and if you want

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,390
to get these slides I know that they are

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,460
attached to the presentation at least

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,960
last I checked they were and when I look

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,450
they are I hope they are for everyone

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:32,340
else otherwise I do have a URL shortener

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:35,329
if you want to get to it that way so

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,369
what is the incubator the incubator is

00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:41,369
really where communities come to learn

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:43,560
the Apache why we take a community who

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:46,049
might be focused from a single company a

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,540
single group of individuals who have

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,829
common goals research projects and

00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:55,890
everyone who's really focused on just

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:58,259
their thing to get them acclimated to

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,619
how to operate as an Apache organization

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,860
Apache organizations are very

00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:07,290
merit-based you gain you basically gain

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,929
following by showing that you know what

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,970
you're doing and we gave you more trust

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,470
as we are more comfortable with the idea

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,320
of you giving that

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,320
back it is the main entry point for any

00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,390
new projects coming to Apache so you

00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,660
will see some projects go straight to

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:27,480
top level those are typically very

00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:29,940
member driven so a high concentration of

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,630
existing Apache members will likely form

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:36,000
the initial PMC of that project and

00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:38,250
those do go straight to the board there

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,370
are some nuances with them they will

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,590
typically be very member driven so they

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,750
already know how to operate an apache

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:49,560
project and already pretty diverse from

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:52,310
a community standpoint but it is more

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,900
common that we're seeing single company

00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,990
really vendor driven projects who want

00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,480
to diversify coming into the incubator

00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:05,520
first and that is really where we see a

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:08,160
lot of growth as a project so why would

00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,410
you want to come to Apache there are

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,420
some reasons you I want to build a

00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:15,030
diverse community you are a single

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:18,150
vendor who wants to publish a standard

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,769
or publish some common goals and you

00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,050
want to get out there to get more people

00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:23,940
interested in your project maybe you've

00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,860
done it on github for a little while and

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:30,300
have seen some growth but you want to

00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:32,760
get some bigger infrastructure behind it

00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,830
to come to Apache we typically don't

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,980
want to see projects who simply want to

00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,840
be labeled as a patchy foo so if your

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,420
goal is to come in because you want that

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,730
Apache prefix on your project you might

00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,799
not be a good fit for us because we're

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,870
really more focused on you becoming a

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,049
stronger community and less focus on you

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:54,450
wanting that Apache brand in fact if you

00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:56,519
look at some of the questionnaires that

00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,010
you go through in the initial proposal

00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:02,780
one of the things is to look at are you

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:05,459
doing this because of a branding issue

00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,019
you also may want to extend or

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,480
strengthen your existing community it

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,700
could be that you are a single Pringle

00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,230
commit or type of project a couple of

00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,090
people who get together every now and

00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,549
then working on something and you want

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:20,280
to be able to diversify outside of your

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:23,220
own goals so by having a foundation

00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,690
behind you you are trying to move away

00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,080
from Vanetta

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:30,210
benevolent dictatorship and want to and

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,520
said grow to outside contributors

00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:37,200
feeling that they can give as much as

00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:39,570
the initial contributors better so why

00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,160
would you incubate there are a whole

00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,810
bunch of reasons why you would incubate

00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,240
over going straight to the top level

00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:48,030
project you might be focused on learning

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,970
the Apache way the Apache fundamentals

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:53,610
all the policies that go into becoming

00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:57,180
an Apache project and because of that

00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:59,460
the incubator is typically the right way

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,170
for you to come in you want to

00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,090
understand how to cut it release you may

00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:05,010
not know all the mechanics behind it

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,780
Justin will actually be giving a

00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,230
presentation in this room right after

00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,970
this to talk about the intricacies of

00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:14,910
building that first release and really

00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,380
what we're looking for another reason if

00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,230
you might be looking to learn the Apache

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,840
way that's how I learned it I learned it

00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:23,880
through the incubator and I think it's a

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,520
great thing to learn you start to

00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:30,360
understand not only how to build an

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,490
internal community within your project

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,430
but you also start to see how to build

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,140
in corporate type of community there

00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,180
will be a talk a little bit this

00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,310
afternoon and I think around 2:30 it's

00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,820
more of a panel discussion around the

00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:46,650
incubator it's sort of a new topic so

00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:50,760
we'll be getting a few people together

00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:52,169
to talk through that you also want to be

00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,169
able to prove out that you can grow

00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:57,870
community if you're starting from five

00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:59,910
people ten people and you've been that

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,830
way for two years you might be getting

00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,080
to a point where you have to show that

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,840
you can gain more people gain more

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,220
traction into your project and coming in

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,320
through the incubator might be a way to

00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,300
do that we generally have more relaxed

00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,970
policies around voting in committers and

00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:19,020
PBMC members then you would see in a

00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:21,210
top-level project the other reason is

00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,160
you're not sure of the licensing status

00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:27,330
of your project this is a very awkward

00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:30,090
one but let's say you have built some

00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:32,729
code you have some existing projects and

00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,350
existing source code or a baked in your

00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:36,060
application you're not sure about

00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,340
licensing state and you actually need

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,860
legal assistance yet

00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,810
cleared up you are effectively becoming

00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,000
an Apache project but one of the things

00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:46,610
we do help you with is the overall IP

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,560
clearance and SGA's that would be

00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,410
required to make your project work as a

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,449
top-level so helps you clear a lot of

00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:57,250
that stuff up and it is typically where

00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:57,250
we find the most hardship in pod Lang's

00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,949
how do you incubate so if you are

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,860
getting started in the incubator hours

00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:09,530
there this is small crowd how many of

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,960
you are not actually an appalling today

00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:16,430
or do you all represent paddling's

00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:18,770
existing pod Lang's you're not okay so

00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:22,430
you might be looking to bring in a new

00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:25,520
project to Apache you one of the reasons

00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:27,050
you might be doing that is to form a you

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,389
have so you can system codebase you want

00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,530
to get more people interested in it the

00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:32,479
first thing you have to do is find a

00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:34,340
champion the champion is the person

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,630
who's going to act as your mentor your

00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,860
guide through the proposal process

00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:41,360
champions aren't necessarily your

00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,820
mentors for once you're accepted

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,729
although we really like to see champions

00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,260
stay on for the duration of your project

00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:50,300
but a champion is really to help you get

00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,330
acclimated to the beginnings of ecology

00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,590
before you're even a part of Apache

00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:57,560
helping you navigate our mailing list

00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:59,889
some of our wiki's and getting your

00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,620
actual proposal through the incubator

00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:05,510
accept it as a paddling they are very

00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,220
focused on dealing with you on a

00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,419
personal basis so a lot of the

00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,430
communication that you're dealing with

00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:13,460
with your champion will be private it

00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:15,169
will be off list although we're hoping

00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,110
that it stays as limit as possible to

00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:20,539
just forming the proposal once you've

00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,849
begun to form your proposal you will

00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:24,770
start to discuss it on list and ideally

00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:27,740
you will start to find mentors on your

00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:29,990
project from the incubator general list

00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,849
so some cases you might have a

00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,800
pre-existing list people that you may

00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:35,900
know internally within your organization

00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,000
who work with it existing committers on

00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,890
your project who have worked with apache

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,380
in the past and are willing to stand up

00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:44,089
for you or you might have brand new

00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,339
people who are interested in the project

00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:49,760
from a technical standpoint like let's

00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:51,709
say you're working on a CDN Network and

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,810
we have a whole bunch of people at Cisco

00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:55,639
at Apache and they have to be also

00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,440
interested in a CDN network it might be

00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:01,220
a good fit for some of them to help you

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,440
get through the incubator driving your

00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,149
proposal will probably be a long time

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,870
depending on how complicated your

00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:11,029
project structure is it's usually a

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:13,190
month from what I've seen for most

00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:15,649
puzzling so don't be surprised it takes

00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,820
a while at the same time you want to

00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:19,730
make sure that you are in constant

00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:22,220
communication so if you as a pod Ling

00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:24,740
are trying to as you as a prospective

00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,639
paddling are trying to focus on getting

00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,260
into Apache

00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:29,630
we want to see you as quick as possible

00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,240
turnaround propose edits so that your

00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:36,230
champion might be giving to you to make

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,850
it into a good proposal usually your

00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,470
champion will help you draft in a number

00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,180
of ways they might be directly editing

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,920
the wiki they might be posting the

00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,079
actual proposal to the wiki that you

00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,510
have built offline through email

00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:49,970
communication back and forth it all

00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:51,470
depends on how comfortable you are with

00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:55,069
the process and how comfortable you are

00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:58,100
typing all this up it's not uncommon to

00:09:55,069 --> 00:10:01,160
simply see a champion one day just post

00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:03,980
a massive proposal to the incubator wiki

00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,889
and put it out there for an initial

00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:10,190
review and the general list depends on

00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:11,750
how closely you know that champion that

00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,639
was actually the case for netbeans when

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,220
they came on board we suddenly woke up

00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:18,380
one morning and there was a massive list

00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:23,569
of 500 potential new committers coming

00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:24,769
in your mentors will help you guide that

00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:27,110
help guide you during the incubation

00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:29,300
process they may help you prior to

00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:31,279
incubation as well depending on who they

00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,990
are and what their strengths are but

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,319
ideally the champion will be doing a lot

00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:37,339
of the pre incubation work with you

00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:40,220
ideally we want to see your champion

00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:41,839
stay on board and the best pod legs are

00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,209
always the ones that have their mentor

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,199
stay on for the duration of their

00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:47,199
incubation period

00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:53,170
usually your discussion threads will

00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:55,780
lead to more contributors and these

00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:57,910
would be people who have not experienced

00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,760
your project in the past and potentially

00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:02,350
have some thoughts on what they want to

00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,420
do what they want to see from your

00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:06,190
project you have to be very careful

00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,080
about these types of contributors and

00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,760
it's actually a good time to start

00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,490
looking at how to leverage the Apache

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,350
way in the Apache voting process to

00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:15,520
bring in those new contributors there

00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,900
are a lot of people who will sign up

00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,430
because they're very interested in a

00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,430
project that they want to be a committer

00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:23,380
and that's okay and it's also okay to

00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,270
tell them let's wait to see your

00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,310
contributions to the project and we will

00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:29,760
vote you in as a committer if we feel

00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:32,200
that your contributions warrant that

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,590
there are a lot of cases where I've seen

00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,150
people sign up to commit and throughout

00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,860
the entire incubation process they've

00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:40,600
never committed code they've never even

00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:46,410
subscribed to the mailing list for that

00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:49,360
project so be very selective your

00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:51,700
discussion thread for the proposal will

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,460
also lead to your very first vote

00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:57,550
sometimes the champions kick this off

00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:59,410
today we just had pulsar start off their

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:02,200
vote thread and that thread was kicked

00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:04,630
off by their champion in most cases it

00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,510
should be the people coming from the

00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:09,910
project kicking off that boat there's

00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:12,070
also really no notion of a binding vote

00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,870
versus a non-binding vote there's very

00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:16,120
few cases that I've seen where a

00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:18,400
paddling is not accepted into the

00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,050
incubator and if they get to the point

00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,880
of actually submitting their proposal to

00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:25,120
a vote it's pretty much an affirmative

00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,460
we are going to move forward with us we

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,320
will usually point out problems with

00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:32,470
proposals during the discussion phase

00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:35,050
and ask you publicly as well as

00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,640
potentially privately to consider what

00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,960
you're asking for and make sure that

00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,090
you're actually ready to go for

00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,130
something like this a good case like

00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:43,780
this might be we've looked at your

00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:47,830
source code and there's a large amount

00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:51,190
of LGPL LGPL license all source code

00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:53,110
within what you're donating you can't

00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:55,330
just bring that to Apache we can't rely

00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:57,940
some fat source code under Apache if you

00:12:55,330 --> 00:13:00,290
give us a an SGA we can deal with that

00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:04,879
if you're not giving us an SGA

00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:07,100
for that source code you can't you can't

00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:10,429
come to Apache we cannot deal with your

00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:12,549
LGPL code it's simply one of our hard

00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:15,529
rules from a licensing standpoint we one

00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:18,889
category a software that might include

00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:21,079
apache license and like t license bsd

00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:24,709
two and three clause license source code

00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:26,899
but not anything that would cause a sort

00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:29,149
of copyleft situation for an incoming

00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:30,919
project so you have to be very careful

00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:33,799
about what it is you are trying to bring

00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:36,319
to us and there are certain cases where

00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:37,970
we basically said we can't do this

00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:41,089
NetBeans is actually another good

00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:43,549
example in this area they have certain

00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:47,989
portions of the NetBeans IDE that are

00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:50,839
basically Forks of the JDK they cannot

00:13:47,989 --> 00:13:53,600
include that in their actual donation

00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:57,859
into Apache because it is a derivative

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,299
of C BL + GPL license code so they're

00:13:57,859 --> 00:14:02,749
trying to figure out a way internally

00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:05,470
within Oracle to bring that over or make

00:14:02,749 --> 00:14:11,779
it a publicly dynamically linkable

00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:13,699
solution so you've had a vote thread

00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:15,709
you've had a disco sorry you've had a

00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:17,689
discussion you've had a vote the

00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:19,730
incubator has accepted you so what

00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:21,619
starts happening now this is the very

00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:24,769
first time that you can be considered a

00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:27,319
patchy foo for whatever foo is prior to

00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:29,600
the acceptance of your vote you are not

00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:32,899
an Apache project and you would be

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:36,350
violating our part of our trademarks by

00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:38,689
saying you are Apache foo so we do ask

00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:40,519
that prior to your acceptance you are

00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:42,649
not referred to as an Apache project

00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:46,429
even though it might be looking very

00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:48,109
good that you will get accepted it's

00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:50,029
very rare that you'll run into this type

00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:52,699
of problem there was a conference I was

00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:54,049
added back in September one of the

00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:55,519
projects copping would be labeled Apache

00:14:54,049 --> 00:14:57,979
foo they weren't actually accepted to

00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,350
Apache they did get accepted a couple

00:14:57,979 --> 00:15:02,509
weeks later but it gets into this weird

00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:06,379
state of you're not actually Apache

00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:07,939
whatever you said you were we do want

00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:10,339
you to get started as soon as possible

00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:12,950
so there are certain cases where I've

00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:14,389
seen paddling's take 3-4 months

00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,160
start bringing their source code over

00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:22,639
start bringing their discussion lists

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:26,320
over that is unfortunate but it is the

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,639
fact of life just because of what the

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,139
communication the confusion around how

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,320
to actually bring this project in if

00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:35,480
you're an existing github project it's

00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:39,230
very easy to simply add one of the infer

00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,820
guys to the committer list and they will

00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:43,639
be able to help move your source code

00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:45,980
over if you are not already on github

00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:47,959
then it's a matter of just getting a

00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:51,440
repository created we've been able to

00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:53,480
automate about 95% of that for you

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,459
there's now just a simple web form your

00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,459
champion your mentors can just go to

00:15:55,459 --> 00:16:01,100
create a repo and it will be up within a

00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:02,839
couple hours and as soon as that's there

00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,699
if you have a software grant if you have

00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:05,990
IP clearance you might be going through

00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:11,060
you can start writing to our

00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:13,070
repositories the champion is done at

00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,630
this point so while they might be

00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,949
helping you with the bootstrap if they

00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:18,620
are doing that they're really becoming

00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:20,360
more of a mentor and that is where the

00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:23,060
delineation between your mentors and

00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,890
your champion starts to change your

00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,600
champion was about getting you into the

00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:31,010
incubator your mentor is about getting

00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:32,990
you really out of the incubator we hope

00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,880
that they are continuing on as a mentor

00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:36,560
though it makes a lot of sense and

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,010
because you are already familiar with

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,350
them prior to joining Apache that you

00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:44,540
might be more comfortable with them

00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,980
staying on there are certain cases where

00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:48,320
people didn't actually realize this

00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,149
difference and didn't make themselves a

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,279
mentor if that is the case it's very

00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:54,260
easy to add a mentor through pot leg

00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:55,819
there's no vote required there's nothing

00:16:54,260 --> 00:17:00,350
it's just hey I'm mentoring this pod

00:16:55,819 --> 00:17:01,850
thing down great the other thing is

00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:06,890
mentors will deal with for you or

00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:09,380
mailing lists email archives getting

00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:12,439
accounts set up so everyone would be

00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:14,780
expected to sign an eye CLA is an

00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:17,660
individual contributing into Apache if

00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:20,600
there is a company behind it the company

00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:23,000
may feel the need to submit a CCL a

00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,939
however we don't actually require a CCL

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,390
a it is mostly to be able to say from

00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:28,040
come

00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:29,840
company there is something on file

00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:33,230
saying these people who are your

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,540
employees are giving right acts are

00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:38,750
being given right access to a project

00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:41,390
that you donate it to us there is no

00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:43,220
additional legal binding around ACC LA

00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,900
so it wouldn't actually give you

00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:49,820
anything to be able to say this is the

00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:51,380
only project they're contributing so we

00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,630
want to see you migrate your development

00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:56,330
over as soon as possible we want to see

00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:59,270
everything in email so we are very old

00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:01,400
in this case you've heard a few people

00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:03,230
use the term Greybeard in some

00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,720
discussions some sure this is in the

00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:07,610
first time so we like email we like

00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,680
email archives so the more that we can

00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:11,810
see in history the more that it's

00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:15,020
searchable the better we are to be able

00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:16,640
to cover what has been discussed we do

00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:19,310
run JIRA and bugzilla

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,120
internally most projects are using JIRA

00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:27,020
bugzilla really old projects I don't

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:30,200
want to use that term but Tomcat some

00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:33,800
other projects Open Office I believe or

00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,960
using bugzilla instances so you do run

00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:39,320
into a couple of them if you do want

00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,240
that we are starting to leverage github

00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,890
more and more so projects as they're

00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,230
coming on board it may make sense for

00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:48,140
them if they're already doing github we

00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:51,800
can now support github based projects so

00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:53,420
by being a gift a github based project

00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,870
you would have direct access to issue

00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:59,590
management wiki direct write access to

00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:02,390
merge pull requests directly on github

00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:03,680
if that is what you're used to we don't

00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,600
have a problem with it and we can

00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:08,000
actually support you now going forward

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,410
we have a couple of top-level projects

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,300
who have been prototyping it for a

00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:13,400
couple of months now we have a few pod

00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,720
links who have started to use that we

00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,480
had one just converted this week

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,400
annotator and I think MX net is coming

00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,220
over pretty soon as soon as we're source

00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,320
code comes in so we do have a couple

00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,810
projects coming in and it was originally

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:32,950
spun up for the open Wisc team to be

00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:32,950
able to prototype if you are yes

00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:42,220
yeah yes so the question is are we

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,420
talking about at the github mirror in

00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,550
this case we're actually talking about

00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:47,860
instead of the github mirror you have

00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:50,020
github as your primary source code

00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,970
repository what we do is we create

00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,550
individual teams for every project

00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:56,890
including pod links which is where the

00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:58,780
Lim Z roster tools come in to be able to

00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:00,670
manage who actually has write access to

00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,190
that toddling or to that project source

00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:05,830
code by doing that what we're doing is

00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,690
creating a team in github assigning

00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,820
members to that team depending on what

00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:11,740
their permission scheme is and that

00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:14,500
gives them right access to those repos

00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:16,750
we mirror those back using a tool called

00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,070
git box very similar to what we did for

00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:21,070
get mirroring except it does

00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:23,320
bi-directional we don't recommend doing

00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:25,270
it bidirectionally though so while it

00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,190
does support some bi-directional I would

00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:28,900
strongly recommend this is especially

00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:31,420
based on whatever was just telling me

00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:34,000
about half an hour ago right to one

00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:37,590
repository if you want to use github use

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,590
github don't yes

00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:51,510
we started off the kind of all place to

00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:54,929
go so the question is can we use it now

00:20:51,510 --> 00:21:03,600
as a bottling absolutely it is open yes

00:20:54,929 --> 00:21:15,659
sir as a top-level project so the

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:17,250
question is can use a TLT yes I know I

00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:22,770
can just spend the rest of your time

00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:24,360
talking about github using so you can

00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:27,000
literally do it right now if you wanted

00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,470
to it starts off as a discussion on your

00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,080
mailing list just like anything else

00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:34,230
we're asking you to do assuming everyone

00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:38,429
has feels comfortable with doing it

00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:41,190
create a an infra ticket to switch over

00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:43,409
it is a little bit of a hard switch over

00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,779
so there might be a couple hours where

00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:50,270
you don't have write access but once you

00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:50,270
have that it's pretty seamless yes

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,320
everybody

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,550
[Laughter]

00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:28,530
organization so we had an organization

00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:30,419
gave up everything is that right I

00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:33,299
wasn't at me for my own intuition so I

00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:35,309
was at integrations with black the chaos

00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:38,429
is what books with everything I'm not

00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:54,919
all going at me that's true so you will

00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:58,770
lose but yep as well yes Elkanah be good

00:22:54,919 --> 00:23:01,250
about that dijo al nothing breaks it's a

00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:07,470
transfer so your whole URL 50 cocktails

00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:09,570
yeah yeah - malvinas up added a key and

00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,999
we switched

00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:18,809
yeah I don't feel so great but I can

00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:20,279
help us pretty good up no no no this is

00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:22,080
great conversation because this is part

00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:48,029
of what I want to see paddling's talk

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:49,739
more another want to get there people

00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:51,960
when they be around 8:00 on it so they

00:23:49,739 --> 00:23:53,340
have to say that I found they're

00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,289
wonderful but they shouldn't want to

00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:58,259
talk a little right so that's having fun

00:23:55,289 --> 00:24:01,440
benefit of which is searchable through

00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:04,039
Google they help technicians are to our

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,039
benefit

00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:10,429
yep honey for parameters that are used

00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:13,999
to say the holy or the open salon teez

00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:17,779
okay Alan okay but if commerce is going

00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:24,070
to get this thing so after now yes

00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:24,070
definitely tell me the URL of a problem

00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:29,779
how do you knew that because you have

00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:32,360
users on github and epoxy member users

00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:36,080
and you have a whole kitchen piece tool

00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:37,340
that migrated that also rewrite okay so

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,200
all your history stays the same

00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:41,659
you're just moving where your primary

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,340
repository is located if you have to

00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:45,289
same use there you have commits from

00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:48,110
before and of your committee with new

00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:53,049
users that you can get computer all that

00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:53,049
history still has it's not as much fun

00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:04,919
and your history fill all your

00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:14,970
commissars kappa w it's always we want

00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:18,419
to rewrite those in it yep no yep lots

00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:20,549
of report for Cordova and we're still a

00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:23,129
severe so a Franco's with makeup and a

00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:25,110
few micrometers policy my face hunter

00:25:23,129 --> 00:25:27,720
walking up there the trickiest you need

00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:30,389
to go to grab a plastic ID profile and

00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,730
there's a top success western makeup ID

00:25:30,389 --> 00:25:36,960
and that's a connection between your

00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:38,429
rebar apache ID - I'm also a help I eat

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,710
right and you have to go to that

00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:43,440
associated connect this up yep and then

00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:45,560
that you are given all I go inside this

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,050
guy's is requirement

00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:50,150
kind of sui Fikri that knows that okay

00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:53,110
oh yeah

00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:53,110
use it by smell

00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:57,500
yeah like I have four or five email

00:25:55,250 --> 00:26:10,580
addresses in my own github account so

00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:12,890
I've had to deal with PI so that I don't

00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,780
believe yeah I don't think that that is

00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:17,000
currently supported migration you would

00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:21,790
have to do an export and then an import

00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,790
and I'm not sure that there's a direct

00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:58,340
there were a couple of projects the name

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,950
starts with an A but I forgot the rest

00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:03,530
of it they actually did an export from

00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:05,900
their pre-existing JIRA and import it

00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:08,630
into US it took like ten or fifteen

00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:10,460
tries to get it right but we were able

00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:12,560
to create a temporary project do the

00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:15,110
test import confirm everything was

00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:19,910
working and then do a final import into

00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:23,170
JIRA going out it's I yeah github issues

00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:23,170
aren't a huge thing for me

00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:32,530
yep yeah

00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:44,920
okay so now that we've had this on

00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:48,160
github discussion let's keep going on IP

00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,870
issues so in most cases especially when

00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,090
it's coming from an internal developed

00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:54,160
project you're going to have a software

00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:55,810
grant and your software grant should be

00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,300
from your existing company or the

00:27:55,810 --> 00:28:00,070
existing author saying I am granting the

00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,230
Apache Software Foundation the ability

00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:05,290
to use this software under the Apache

00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:08,050
License and that software grant is meant

00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:08,920
to avoid patent issues avoid naming

00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,720
issues

00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,850
we're expecting as part of that grant

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,010
you're actually giving full basically

00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:17,320
full openness of your source code and

00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:18,970
allowing it to be used by the foundation

00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,610
you are not actually donating that

00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:23,220
software to the foundation the existing

00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:25,210
authors can still claim their rights

00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:27,420
that's actually one of the things built

00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:30,790
into the notice file that goes into your

00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:33,340
project if you are an existing committer

00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:35,080
as a third party you might want to list

00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:39,030
your name out in the notice file saying

00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:43,780
that prior to 2015 this was developed at

00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:45,550
Comcast or gig spaces and that is okay

00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,130
because that software is actually

00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:50,050
developed by you internally we want to

00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:51,550
carry forward those names as much as

00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:53,710
possible to be able to give you

00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:55,390
continued credit once you start

00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:58,180
developing at Apache though it is

00:28:55,390 --> 00:29:00,160
assumed that you are you as a and

00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:02,350
individual are making that contribution

00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:05,590
you are not making that contribution on

00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:07,030
behalf of your employer anymore so you

00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:10,600
have to make sure that you have access

00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:14,830
to do that I know in my company we deal

00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:17,860
with a pretty long employer covenants

00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:19,480
agreement that goes over everything that

00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,880
is owned by the company and everything

00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,560
that is not owned by the company and you

00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,300
should look for things like that within

00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:27,010
your own organizations to make sure that

00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:29,860
you've either signed off on it you've

00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:33,090
listed it or the company is saying that

00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:36,610
it's okay to do do this at Apache if

00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:38,680
you're an existing software project you

00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:40,930
might not need a grant if you are

00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:43,810
existing Apache license if you are

00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:45,940
existing MIT or BSD and leaving that

00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:48,760
software the same you might not have to

00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:50,130
transfer the license because as far as

00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,950
we're concerned these are just saw

00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:54,419
we're dependencies that are

00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:57,179
appropriately licensed category a as we

00:29:54,419 --> 00:30:00,150
like to call it if you are outside of

00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:02,280
that small realm category B like e PLC

00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:05,039
dbl where we can bring in binary

00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,750
dependencies that is going to be an

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,169
issue and we would expect there to be

00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:12,150
some form of grams to change that

00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:14,130
license structure really the grant is

00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:18,090
when you want to change the licensing of

00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:20,880
your existing source code if you don't

00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:23,010
have access to the original author let's

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,159
say it was developed out on github by

00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:28,409
some individual and they may have

00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,409
abandoned the project you want to bring

00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:33,720
in that source source code you can't do

00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:35,490
that without doing a grant if it's not

00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,429
appropriate it's not existing apache

00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:41,130
license you can bring it in and ideally

00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:43,230
not modify it and that will not be an

00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:44,730
issue you just have to be very careful

00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:47,190
about headers that you add to the

00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:51,809
software you don't want to in a

00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:54,510
proprietary v2 headers to an MIT license

00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:56,669
project because that will lead to a lot

00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:58,530
of problems we also want to make sure

00:30:56,669 --> 00:31:01,770
that the original author in those cases

00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:03,870
is control is called out correctly so if

00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:05,640
it is MIT license make sure that the MIT

00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:07,980
license includes their copyright

00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:10,380
statement if it's BSD license you

00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,690
actually don't use the BSD license

00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:14,909
directly everyone who is using a BSD

00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:17,490
license is using a derivative of the BSD

00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:20,340
license with a number of placeholders

00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:22,460
replaced so you want to make sure that

00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:25,500
you're bringing in their copy of the BSD

00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:29,309
into your license file to correctly call

00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:32,549
it out we want to keep the source code

00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:34,710
as clean as possible so wherever

00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:36,809
possible try to avoid ringing in other

00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:38,250
projects and instead come up with ways

00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:40,830
that you might be able to depend on them

00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:42,480
from a binary standpoint if you get to a

00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:45,450
situation where you need to start

00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,480
modifying it consult with the legal team

00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:50,610
and post on legal discuss to see what

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,580
their recommendation is in most cases

00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:56,100
it's going to be that's fine but at

00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:59,100
least we have an audit trail now email

00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,790
to be able to say this project was okay

00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:04,000
to do this

00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:04,000
yes sir

00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:19,910
so I'm assuming what you guys were just

00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:21,230
asking about go is very interesting one

00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:23,480
because it's a newer language and we

00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:27,890
haven't spent a lot of time analyzing it

00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:31,460
I think as long as everything in go is

00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:33,470
the same license it may work out for you

00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:37,400
but it looks like it's a very heavy

00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:39,170
thing it's almost like it's NPM again if

00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,370
there's some way that you don't have to

00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:43,190
bring in the source code and instead

00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:44,990
there's some some equivalent of package

00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:47,360
JSON that brings in your dependencies

00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:49,820
during the build that seems like a more

00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,010
appropriate thing to do I don't know a

00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:55,310
lot about go but from what I understand

00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:57,020
there's a go get I would expect that as

00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:58,880
part of your build for any go based

00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:04,540
software you're running a go get to

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,540
bring in that software yeah

00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:17,850
that's poverty the hash get upset you

00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:20,309
get a free actual word the hash of that

00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:22,470
weight come in Center and you need to

00:33:20,309 --> 00:33:24,299
get the license amendment under like the

00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:26,750
same table depending on these other

00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:26,750
project

00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,630
okay

00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,290
you just have to watch out what you do

00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:42,970
including your license file because you

00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:44,650
don't want to have a bloated license

00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:46,870
file when you do cut a release

00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:49,000
Justin's going to talk about that in a

00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:50,740
little bit but ideally your license file

00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,470
should only represent what is in the

00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:55,720
source package your binary license file

00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:58,930
may be different and could be completely

00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,050
different is there another question or

00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:01,050
no

00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:18,389
yes we would expect that the import to

00:34:14,849 --> 00:34:21,090
the Apache repositories includes the

00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:23,700
relicensing there are certain cases

00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:25,919
where that may not have happened as long

00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:29,310
as we have an SGA on file and by the

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,810
time you leave the incubator all of your

00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:39,990
license headers are correct that's

00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:41,790
generally a good thing yes yep

00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:44,429
and that's generally true of any

00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:46,050
organization you're in any sort of any

00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:48,240
open-source project you're dealing with

00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:51,780
you don't change someone else's License

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,159
Center even if it's wrong because

00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:56,899
they're the ones who applied that

00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:56,899
License Center it's not your source code

00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:02,250
the other case that you might have

00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,410
instead of doing a software grant is to

00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:06,420
do an IP clearance IP clearances are

00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:09,000
more about donations to existing

00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,950
projects but may actually be a better

00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,070
solution for an existing open source

00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:15,930
project what we do is we review what the

00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:17,970
source code is out on an existing

00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:20,339
repository most cases going to be a

00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:23,250
github repository review it for any

00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:25,200
licensing problems open a 72 hour vote

00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,640
thread to see if anyone has any

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,430
objections to bring it in and then

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,109
actually bring in that source code so in

00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:33,300
a lot of cases if you are an existing

00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:35,490
open source project this might be the

00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,960
correct solution for you so you might

00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:39,300
want to check with your mentors and see

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:43,520
which they would recommend especially if

00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,520
there is no existing vendor behind it

00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:49,260
always can always credit the original

00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,050
author so if you are bringing in source

00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:53,580
code that wasn't developed by you

00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:55,320
specifically and was developed by

00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:57,630
someone else existing open source

00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:00,300
project like how many projects in here

00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:02,820
dependent on bootstrap for a website or

00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:05,130
some sort of UI component you wouldn't

00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:07,109
actually you're in because of the way

00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:09,750
bootstrap works you typically have to

00:36:07,109 --> 00:36:11,430
bring in their CSS files and are making

00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,839
some change to them you need to make

00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:15,210
sure you're calling that out in your

00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:17,200
license and notice file well no your

00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:21,250
license file because it's

00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,869
most of its MIT we prefer transitive

00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:26,200
dependencies wherever possible so if you

00:36:22,869 --> 00:36:28,869
are doing things like NGO or NPM we want

00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:38,020
to see package.json or NGO Depp's and

00:36:28,869 --> 00:36:39,460
listing that out yes if you don't have

00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:42,069
to actually bring in the bootstrap CSS

00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:44,260
into your repository there's no reason

00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:47,500
to call it out in your license for the

00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:50,260
source license if you start modifying

00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,780
the existing bootstrap CSS then you do

00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:54,849
have to include it likewise if you have

00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:57,730
a binary output of your project that

00:36:54,849 --> 00:37:01,230
includes the bootstrap CSS you need to

00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:01,230
call that out in your license file

00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:24,440
is it checked into your repository and

00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:24,440
part of your source release okay okay

00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:29,890
so if you are not including the file in

00:37:27,249 --> 00:37:35,319
a release then it does not get listed in

00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:39,179
your license if you include it in a

00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:41,650
binary release or somehow otherwise

00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:43,420
package it repackage it you do have to

00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:45,099
call it out in your binary release your

00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,539
source release your binary releases

00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:50,229
should be very specific about those

00:37:46,539 --> 00:37:52,929
contents so wherever possible we want to

00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:54,130
use transitive dependencies this is what

00:37:52,929 --> 00:37:56,499
he's describing is a little bit of a

00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:59,019
hack but it works because you're not

00:37:56,499 --> 00:38:04,329
actually using that source that software

00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:06,640
directly in your project so you've

00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:08,799
gotten everything into Apache eh you're

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,939
operating under your existing project we

00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:12,400
want to see you start to build a

00:38:09,939 --> 00:38:14,579
community so once your software is in

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,410
and you can start working with it in our

00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:19,809
repositories on our mailing list you can

00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:22,509
now start building that community out

00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:26,109
wherever possible we want to avoid the

00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:27,819
loudest voice in the room you know that

00:38:26,109 --> 00:38:30,219
happens a lot of places and a lot of

00:38:27,819 --> 00:38:32,170
different opinions but sometimes when

00:38:30,219 --> 00:38:34,839
you're doing corporate environments the

00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:38,229
person speaking the loudest or talking

00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:39,459
the most is the one who wins email helps

00:38:38,229 --> 00:38:42,160
avoid that

00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:44,049
it also helps avoid anyone feeling left

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,150
out or not even knowing that a decision

00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:48,429
was made so while I know a lot of people

00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:49,949
are using slack and we're HipChat or

00:38:48,429 --> 00:38:52,449
other synchronous communication

00:38:49,949 --> 00:38:54,249
mechanisms we want to see as much as

00:38:52,449 --> 00:38:55,839
possible communication happening on

00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:57,549
mailing lists we want to see the

00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:00,130
decisions happening on mailing lists so

00:38:57,549 --> 00:39:01,449
that everyone is aware of it it is the

00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,219
biggest struggle for paddling's

00:39:01,449 --> 00:39:05,799
especially when everyone is co-located

00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:08,529
in a single office where everyone's

00:39:05,799 --> 00:39:11,679
working in a same time zone it's very

00:39:08,529 --> 00:39:13,569
hard to switch from I'm walking up to

00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:14,829
your desk to ask you a question or I'm

00:39:13,569 --> 00:39:17,079
actually sitting next to you and we're

00:39:14,829 --> 00:39:18,699
working on this together - hey I just

00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:21,929
sent you an email about this can you

00:39:18,699 --> 00:39:23,890
respond very different mindsets and

00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:26,979
sometimes doesn't work in corporate

00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:28,779
mentalities I know for my day job we

00:39:26,979 --> 00:39:31,269
actually do pair programming a lot I

00:39:28,779 --> 00:39:34,150
don't see my email after about 9:30 in

00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:37,890
the morning so it gets very hard to

00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:37,890
respond to emails if I am pairing

00:39:43,229 --> 00:39:48,430
so that's still good as long as you are

00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:50,499
communicating it and it's mirroring back

00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:52,660
to our mailing list that will solve that

00:39:50,499 --> 00:39:55,029
issue if you are more comfortable

00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:58,150
talking on a github pull request or on a

00:39:55,029 --> 00:40:00,910
JIRA issue tracker or even a github

00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:02,380
issue or a Bugzilla issue as long as we

00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:04,479
have some way to be able to go back and

00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,979
say this is what happened if someone's

00:40:04,479 --> 00:40:07,690
not even listening to that JIRA ticket

00:40:05,979 --> 00:40:09,460
the fact that the JIRA tickets are all

00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:11,890
getting mirrored back to your email is

00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:12,969
what makes that work and everyone's

00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:14,859
going to have different opinions about

00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:17,289
how they want to operate as long as

00:40:14,859 --> 00:40:18,989
that's clear to any new contributor that

00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:22,509
this is how they're expected to operate

00:40:18,989 --> 00:40:24,460
it's okay we don't want to tell you that

00:40:22,509 --> 00:40:26,710
you have to directly write every single

00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:28,509
email we want to be able to say okay

00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:29,849
it's fine you have JIRA and we're

00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:31,960
mirroring all the JIRA issue

00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:33,789
communication back or if you have a

00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:37,839
github issue it's going back to your

00:40:33,789 --> 00:40:39,999
github issues mailing list as much as

00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:45,309
that as possible different ways to

00:40:39,999 --> 00:40:46,599
communicate but all welcome yes so

00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:48,249
that's the critical piece you want to

00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:49,989
make sure it's consistent so that if I

00:40:48,249 --> 00:40:52,029
were walking in as a new contributor I

00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:53,859
immediately know how to gain access to

00:40:52,029 --> 00:40:56,739
start talking to you guys do I raise an

00:40:53,859 --> 00:40:58,170
issue do I send an email out saying hey

00:40:56,739 --> 00:41:00,009
what do you think about this feature

00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:06,700
that's what you want to make sure is

00:41:00,009 --> 00:41:08,019
clear to everyone who's participating so

00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,789
your dependencies are only going to

00:41:08,019 --> 00:41:15,400
become a problem when you start to get

00:41:09,789 --> 00:41:17,619
into a binary release typically your

00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,569
source release should just be an exact

00:41:17,619 --> 00:41:21,700
mirror of what's existing your github

00:41:19,569 --> 00:41:24,670
repo - couple things that may have been

00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:26,289
excluded I know a lot of newer projects

00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:28,690
especially in the jvm world have been

00:41:26,289 --> 00:41:30,940
using Gradle unfortunately we cannot

00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:32,710
support the Gradle wrapper jar file in a

00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:38,559
source release because it is a binary

00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:40,599
file there are other cases like that

00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:42,130
where we simply can't include binaries

00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:44,140
in the source release that's the whole

00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:45,640
point to it being a source release there

00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,099
are certain things that we do include

00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:49,140
like images where

00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:52,979
we're expecting guests as an image and

00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:54,839
fun of iris in fact the last VP legal

00:41:52,979 --> 00:41:57,380
mentioned they're worried because they

00:41:54,839 --> 00:42:00,690
think it might be a virus in a jar file

00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:02,190
you know that's fine but that's

00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:04,920
something we do have to look out for in

00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:07,049
our release you're transitive dependency

00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:10,380
should not bring in anything that to an

00:42:07,049 --> 00:42:11,880
end consumer is either not obvious so if

00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:14,970
you're using hibernate and your

00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:18,180
standalone application that would not be

00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:19,859
obvious if you were a library that

00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:21,930
happened to bring in hibernate as an

00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:23,819
optional integration that is actually an

00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:26,130
acceptable thing to do under the LGPL

00:42:23,819 --> 00:42:27,839
because you're not directly modifying

00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:30,900
anything about hibernate you're inside

00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:34,170
just bringing it in as a dependency

00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:36,809
similarly for CBL you can depend on CDL

00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:39,299
license software even as binary

00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:40,440
dependency because you're not modifying

00:42:39,299 --> 00:42:44,509
anything about it you're simply

00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:46,890
leveraging it from an API standpoint so

00:42:44,509 --> 00:42:48,059
that's stuff you have to be very careful

00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:49,920
about and make sure that it's either

00:42:48,059 --> 00:42:52,890
obvious to your consumer that it's

00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,509
supposed to be there or directly called

00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:56,969
out as being something that is going to

00:42:54,509 --> 00:42:58,289
be used as part of your software if you

00:42:56,969 --> 00:43:01,259
are something that is completely

00:42:58,289 --> 00:43:05,849
standalone a standalone server don't try

00:43:01,259 --> 00:43:08,039
to avoid a lot of those dependencies we

00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:10,109
have a full list of existing resolve

00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:12,719
licenses that you should be reviewing on

00:43:10,109 --> 00:43:15,319
the illegal pages if you don't see a

00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:18,210
license for what it is you're using ask

00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:21,749
before you bring it in

00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:24,119
we will generally be accepting new

00:43:21,749 --> 00:43:26,579
licenses there's been some discussion

00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:28,579
about whether we require OSI approval or

00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:32,099
if we're okay approving it ourselves

00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:34,829
just don't assume that your license will

00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:37,380
be accepted there may be certain clauses

00:43:34,829 --> 00:43:40,200
in that license that make it not usable

00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:43,039
to third parties that might be working

00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,039
with your software

00:43:44,299 --> 00:43:50,009
so how do we get a release out the door

00:43:47,779 --> 00:43:51,390
there's a bunch of things behind it

00:43:50,009 --> 00:43:53,130
Justin going to be talking a little bit

00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:55,890
about it but I do want to cover some

00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:57,390
very high-level things especially what

00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:00,660
we consider to be good practice in the

00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:04,079
incubator do frequent releases don't

00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:06,210
wait until you have all your feature set

00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:09,960
done to do your first release that makes

00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:11,700
a very difficult thing to do we want to

00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,430
see small releases that may not actually

00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:16,319
have business value because really what

00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:18,269
we're after in the incubator is to see

00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,650
do you understand the mechanics and all

00:44:18,269 --> 00:44:22,410
the licensing that goes into that

00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:24,089
release we're less worried about the

00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:26,970
feature set I'm more worried about the

00:44:24,089 --> 00:44:28,920
technical mechanics behind it so the

00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:31,140
more often that you can do a release the

00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,990
cleaner your releases get release after

00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:36,329
release the better off you'll be if you

00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:40,650
have started a release vote and you've

00:44:36,329 --> 00:44:42,180
gotten a questioning response try to

00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:44,279
understand whether that's something that

00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,900
can be cleared up in a following release

00:44:44,279 --> 00:44:49,559
or is that something you should be

00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:52,410
fixing right now more often than not the

00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:54,450
IPM C will say this is a problem we're

00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:58,650
okay with you fixing it in the next

00:44:54,450 --> 00:45:00,720
release but we need you to ask that

00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:03,240
question and there are certain cases

00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:06,750
where it won't be obvious to the present

00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:09,529
to the person calling the release that

00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:12,000
that is the IPM team members opinion

00:45:09,529 --> 00:45:15,269
because it is asynchronous you might not

00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,680
we as either person send me an email the

00:45:15,269 --> 00:45:19,640
person receiving email there might be

00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:22,500
something lost in translation

00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:24,450
every relief should get better what we

00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,880
don't want to see is you had a release

00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:28,980
problem in your last release and now you

00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,599
have a continued release problem you

00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:34,289
didn't fix this license issue that we

00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:36,000
said has to be fixed that is a bad sign

00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:38,549
and it's not something that we want to

00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,740
see happen so the more releases you can

00:45:38,549 --> 00:45:42,930
do the better each release gets the

00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:44,819
better off we'll feel from a project

00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:47,390
standpoint to say you are getting the

00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:47,390
Apache way

00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:53,100
all of our releases are source based

00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:55,380
releases while there may be binary

00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:57,390
releases that go in tandem to your

00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,250
source release all of our releases from

00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:02,130
a licensing standpoint are meant to be

00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:05,270
source code releases we expect our

00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:09,869
Jeezy's with signed files next to them

00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:11,970
indicating what this release is we allow

00:46:09,869 --> 00:46:13,440
you to publish convenience binaries for

00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:16,020
a while the incubator actually did not

00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,360
allow pod links to produce binaries you

00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:21,420
could only produce source code we do

00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:22,920
allow you to mirror two maven central we

00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:24,300
have the infrastructure behind maven

00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,760
central as well that we can help

00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:28,770
synchronize you we do allow you to

00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:31,710
publish to other binary repositories

00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:34,260
like type I and whatever else might be

00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:35,550
out there I'm assuming go has a similar

00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:41,220
one or maybe they're just pointing to

00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:42,990
github to bring in their source code the

00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:45,240
other critical thing is how do you name

00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:48,240
your release this is a very confusing

00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:49,650
part for a lot of projects what we are

00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,360
expecting is that your source

00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:54,000
distribution includes the word

00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:55,740
incubating in it we do not expect that

00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,750
your version number includes the word

00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:59,910
incubating in it a lot of projects have

00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:01,530
done that for convenience but at the end

00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:03,800
of a what we're really expecting is that

00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:07,020
you have something including Apache

00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:09,480
pausing version incubating in your

00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:12,359
source distribution that is all your

00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,890
source distribution we don't have any

00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:16,290
restrictions on what goes into your

00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:17,910
binary distribution and a lot of cases

00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:20,190
your binary distribution may be

00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:21,960
something that has to be driven from

00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:24,570
what the consuming parties are looking

00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,560
for so if you have a binary distribution

00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:27,540
that has to go out there I think

00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:30,060
pipeline has certain formats that

00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:31,590
they're expecting if you need to do that

00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:33,990
that is what is needed to get this

00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:36,180
publishing to that binary format we

00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:37,800
don't have any other than making sure

00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:41,340
that the naming makes a lot of sense

00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:46,800
like if you are my new and you publish

00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:48,750
in two pipe I called runtime new instead

00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,480
that would be a problem for us from a

00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:53,040
branding standpoint however from the

00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,190
source release standpoint we are

00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:58,119
expecting you to call yourself Apache

00:47:55,190 --> 00:48:00,069
paddling named version number incubate

00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:16,180
to be able to get your source release

00:48:00,069 --> 00:48:17,890
through official there is none yet it is

00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:20,529
a problem that we have to start talking

00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:23,410
about and I suspect that problem will

00:48:20,529 --> 00:48:25,059
not be an incubator specific problem so

00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:26,410
we're going to have to be very careful

00:48:25,059 --> 00:48:27,789
about what we do and I think from a

00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:29,140
foundation standpoint we're going to

00:48:27,789 --> 00:48:31,630
have to answer that question because we

00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:33,940
do have T LPS or doing it today

00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:36,849
I think couch TV was the very first one

00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:39,670
to go to github as their primary and

00:48:36,849 --> 00:48:41,140
they haven't done a release yet but I

00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:42,640
suspect that we'll have to come up with

00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:44,079
an answer about what that release is

00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,390
supposed to look like I did just give

00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:49,450
some input to MX net on what they should

00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:51,640
do to avoid some naming issues because

00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:54,549
we don't want to include free releases

00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:55,900
out on github so if you do call for a

00:48:54,549 --> 00:48:57,549
vote on something we want to make sure

00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:00,009
that that doesn't automatically create a

00:48:57,549 --> 00:49:01,599
release for you which github behavior is

00:49:00,009 --> 00:49:08,289
as soon as you tag something that's a

00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:11,730
release and there yes yes yep yeah and

00:49:08,289 --> 00:49:11,730
people get a little bit worried about it

00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,180
okay I talked about what goes into it so

00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:19,520
it's your source code and don't include

00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:23,110
any binaries in source code so no jar

00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:26,780
files images are okay don't depend on

00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:28,730
executables don't depend on existing

00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:31,370
tar.gz files that might be in your

00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:32,510
source code try to strip all that out or

00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:36,430
come up with a build structure that

00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:38,630
doesn't require it so that's about it

00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:40,880
that's really what I want to talk about

00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:42,350
Justin will be in here in a few minutes

00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,510
to talk about the actual mechanics

00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:46,430
behind creating these releases it is a

00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:48,520
very hands-on session that he's doing

00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:50,750
where he's going to be going through a

00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:52,730
some existing stuff that he's done on

00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:54,260
something called catchy wombat patchy

00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:56,150
wombat doesn't exist but it's a project

00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:58,160
he came up with to be able to

00:49:56,150 --> 00:50:00,920
demonstrate how to cut a really good

00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:03,310
release at Apache and get yourself out

00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:05,480
of any problems that may be popping up I

00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:07,490
know we took a lot of questions during

00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:12,650
this or is there any other questions

00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:14,890
that I could answer for you I saw you

00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:14,890
first

00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:22,499
I mean I know for our public area tom

00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:26,039
petty's and free exercises are our event

00:50:22,499 --> 00:50:28,489
betw we use black alarm we're very

00:50:26,039 --> 00:50:28,489
active

00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:36,420
we the only ones eating back no so a lot

00:50:33,809 --> 00:50:38,299
of projects you slack today what I

00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:41,160
personally would like to see is more

00:50:38,299 --> 00:50:45,660
projects that move to the Apache branded

00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:48,210
slack instance the - a SF slack comm we

00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:49,680
do have that out there we are also

00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:51,299
working on ways to be able to mirror

00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:53,190
that information back

00:50:51,299 --> 00:50:56,460
unfortunately the test that we ran last

00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:58,829
night so far hasn't been successful it's

00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:00,779
meant to be like a daily digest of all

00:50:58,829 --> 00:51:10,470
the email that's gone back and forth

00:51:00,779 --> 00:51:11,700
with slack or are all the messages yeah

00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:17,359
I mean we have the free version as well

00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:17,359
it's more of yeah it is 10k limit

00:51:21,109 --> 00:51:25,050
guess one decision

00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:28,530
when you have these offline

00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:32,150
conversations capable bring the decision

00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:32,150
summary back to your family

00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:41,740
that's the most important part about

00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:43,420
this we want to make sure that the

00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:45,520
discussions the decisions that are

00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:47,830
happening or making it back to the

00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:52,180
general public however to make that

00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:54,670
happen just make that happen

00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:57,280
slack is considered offline synchronous

00:51:54,670 --> 00:52:02,310
communication what we're looking for is

00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,310
asynchronous email based communication

00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:10,690
yes

00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:10,690
course

00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,980
Oh

00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:21,630
any type of these volunteers here to be

00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,600
introduced my first time to involved in

00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:29,550
stuff like universe commercial so for

00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:32,280
every need the equations that use just

00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:34,280
linear mythology changes the intuition

00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:36,720
of the ideas are you see the information

00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,230
productivity of me but when I do it

00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,720
really is

00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:42,870
I'm not doing it myself you guys are

00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:45,600
doing for my behalf so that means that

00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:48,930
this is an official apache software

00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:51,750
release backed up by Abacha meaning that

00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:54,780
anyone can support a CVS addressing

00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:58,410
issues and we are possible to be fun and

00:52:54,780 --> 00:53:00,690
places for diabetes yes just because

00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:04,710
it's positive doesn't make you say we go

00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:07,320
with me we need right there for security

00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:10,170
critical part sentence were like to

00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:12,240
spend more money for the last so that's

00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:13,350
made the mission households out on

00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:16,470
business

00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:18,870
mechanics buddy when I heard I must make

00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:20,570
sure that the battle is really important

00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:23,570
to fix that we need right away

00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:23,570
yeah

00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:31,840
through that whole process and we had

00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:34,540
one other security issue in who's the

00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:38,490
right way and kind of left for it and so

00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:42,440
we're going to look at our security

00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:42,440
we're giving people Sunday and then

00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:53,020
yeah I fancy but for families travesty

00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:54,880
be happy that activity got guys right so

00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:56,619
we actually are taking more of a

00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:59,349
hands-off approach when it comes to a

00:53:56,619 --> 00:54:01,030
lot of that and we are delegating most

00:53:59,349 --> 00:54:02,740
of that work to the security team at

00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:05,710
Apache to follow up directly with

00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:07,630
bottling the expectation is that they're

00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:11,950
escalating to the IPM see when the pod

00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:15,160
lling doesn't answer so then you'll get

00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:16,780
slapped twice but ideally you're just

00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:25,260
getting slapped only by the security

00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:25,260
team yep or if you have a security list

00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:49,320
problem yep something put it out

00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:49,320
exactly yep

00:54:52,710 --> 00:55:01,110
your DLP will be up by yourself though

00:54:55,360 --> 00:55:05,050
you'll be beside yourself absolutely

00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:06,220
alright well thank you everyone hope you

00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:07,390
got what you were looking for out of

00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:11,659
this

00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:11,659
