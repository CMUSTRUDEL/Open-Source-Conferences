	Navigating the Incubator Trenches - John D. Ament, Sparta Systems

It can be a daunting task to bring a new project to the Apache Software Foundation. But getting into the incubator and surviving incubation is a pretty easy task, when you know what to do and how to do it. In this session, I'll be giving an overview of incubation, pitfalls to watch out for, and how projects become successful. I'll also give an overview of the IPMC, how to interact with other podlings and make your mark on the ecosystem.

About John D. Ament
I'm a software architect for a company called Sparta Systems in Hamilton NJ. I'm highly active within Apache, and hope to use that experience to provide a great presentation about the Incubator.
