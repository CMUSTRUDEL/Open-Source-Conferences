	From dev@ to user@ to the Apache Way- Steve Blackmon, People Pattern

This talk will cover the journey of Apache Streams (incubating) beyond a solution solely by and for java developers, toward a solution that can provide value for anyone, anywhere along the experience spectrum, regardless of technical preferences. We'll share feedback that served as concentrate focus on mission and usability. We'll walk through some of the improvements made to project code and tooling (maven), documentation (website, examples), and usability (command line interface, maven plugins, zeppelin support, network APIs) to move the project from dev@ to user@, and the opportunities we see to increase usability and relevance still further.
