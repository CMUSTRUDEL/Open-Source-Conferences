Description: 
	How to Govern and Maintain Compliance Using Open Source Identity Management Components - Katarina Valalikova, Evolveum & Shawn McKinney, Symas Corporation

As platform usages continue to expand, so too will the number of identities, which corresponds with a need to govern. There are many reasons. First, it enables people to perform their assigned duties. Second, it prevents unauthorized subjects from committing unwanted actions. Third, it converts manual, error-prone and inefficient identity processes to be automated, verified and compliant. This session introduces the midPoint IdM system released under the ASL 2.0 license. It can be combined with other open source infrastructure components, like Apache Directory, or PostgreSQL, to provide a complete identity management and governance system. There will be a demo showing how midPoint can bind with inbound resources like Peoplesoft, and outbound resources like Google Apps and ActiveDirectory. Advanced topics of organizational unit controls and self-service admin will be touched upon.

so hello everybody and welcome to our

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,080
presentation about how to cover and

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,500
maintain compliance using open source

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,130
identity management components my name

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,780
is Katerina Valle Kova Optometry and

00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:18,029
today's session objective is to learn

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,119
the rationale for identity governance

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,890
and demo some common use cases so using

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,060
the open source identity management

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:29,789
system called midpoint through the

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,579
session video go through the terminology

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:36,059
benefits of video explains what we're

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,940
government is then we will explain our

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,829
architecture and them our use cases if

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:45,750
you have any question also during the

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:47,789
presentation don't hesitate to ask first

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,879
of all what is so the identity

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:53,789
management everybody works for some

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,920
company every company has the employees

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,559
feature we need to manage we need to

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,289
manage the access rights permissions for

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,860
them so we need to create an identity

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:08,880
for them these users or employees are

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:11,189
usually organized in some organizational

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,590
structures they belongs to some

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,619
department so we need to manage also

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,170
this organizational structure we need to

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:22,560
do it in the secure way using some

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,590
security policies as the companies

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,960
usually have many systems we need to do

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,420
the provisioning of access rights for

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,640
the users to different system and we

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,090
need to keep the records of the user

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,460
synchronized between all the systems

00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:41,430
first of all when the new employee is

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,549
hired there is HR department and there

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,100
is some HR system first record about the

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:50,130
new employee is usually created in this

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,979
HR system pulling the data from the

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,710
internal system or we cannot then create

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,840
the appropriate and create and assign

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:02,520
the appropriate access rights for the

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:05,610
new employee so he can now then perform

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,670
himself work for this it's always good

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,319
to have some centralized points or it's

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,590
good to have some identity management

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,349
system which will do it for you

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,530
identity management system will automate

00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:23,220
all the processes related to the

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:25,800
onboarding of new users also the

00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,800
onboarding on users if you'll ensure

00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:32,910
that the users has only the rights they

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,730
had to have to have and it will ensure

00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:43,310
that there is only these accounts which

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:46,940
should exist it's common that many times

00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:51,840
there are situation when you don't know

00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:54,000
about many about the account for example

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,040
you don't know who is the owner of the

00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,329
account or who created the account who

00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,760
approved this account and so on entities

00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:05,610
of all these identity management for

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,400
yeah 19 minutes it's great we got one

00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,780
and you know and it does some things for

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,840
us but there's some problems with it

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,819
right and so some of those problems are

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,140
listed here on the screen that are sort

00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,829
of common problems that we have in our

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,930
enterprise

00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,400
for example there's some roles that are

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,579
more important than others they're

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,769
highly sensitive and so they deserve

00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:29,160
special handling so how do you do that

00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:32,130
in a way that's compliant and that you

00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,049
know that keeps you from from having bad

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,510
things happen from from the wrong people

00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:41,010
having those sensitive roles or we'll

00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:42,840
have situations where maybe too many

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,609
people have assignment to that role or

00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,220
too few people have assignment to that

00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:48,870
role perhaps there are situations where

00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,630
there's a violation of the principle of

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:54,569
least privilege where you know we've

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:58,489
we've given too many people this this

00:03:54,569 --> 00:04:00,900
powerful role or we have problems where

00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:03,660
you know say the manager goes on leave

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,209
that's responsible for setting those

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,380
roles up with their direct reports and

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,079
then while they're on leaves and that

00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,459
creates sort of a gap in the process and

00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:13,680
then people are waiting around for

00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,750
things to happen while that managers on

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,769
leave and how does that happen or maybe

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:22,169
there's situations where perhaps some

00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,150
adjudication has to happen which is to

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:26,070
say you know maybe it's not just one

00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,890
person who has to approve

00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,050
a roll one person has to sign it maybe

00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:33,750
there's two three four people and they

00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:36,300
have to get together and decide whether

00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,580
this person should have access to this

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,480
system or there could be situations

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:44,520
where people are accessing the system

00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,830
directly bypassing the identity

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,290
management system and adding groups and

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:52,200
users directly to that system that then

00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:54,390
is falls outside of of areas of

00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,240
compliance so I mean and that's just a

00:04:54,390 --> 00:05:00,150
sampling of things that can go wrong I'm

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,770
sure that you guys know plenty of other

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:06,030
reasons or you wouldn't be sitting in

00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:08,760
this room right now if some your IDs

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:12,180
happened very often and probably what

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,490
you need is to have access certification

00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,860
approvals notification so then

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,620
escalation or the beauty and other

00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,590
features which all all build the

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:25,170
identity governance as the Gartner says

00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,670
combines with identity management

00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,110
functions to meet all these and

00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,900
compliance obligations

00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:33,990
wait a minute later Gartner katka

00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,850
seriously Gartner the lap dog for the

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,190
the vendors you're going to you're going

00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:40,830
to pull out a buzz word for me identity

00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:43,620
governance I mean does that really mean

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:46,440
anything or is that just something that

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,500
that the vendors used to sell software

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,410
to me that you know that it doesn't

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,840
really do anything at all so yes you're

00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:59,550
also Gartner but there are also other

00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:02,790
definitions like this one that identity

00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:04,770
governance is the mix of high-level

00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:07,500
business processes with low-level

00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:09,540
identity management processes as you can

00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,820
also see on this picture there are two

00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:15,330
parts governance and identity management

00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:17,640
but there is no exact line where the

00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:20,790
governance ends and where the identity

00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:23,460
management starts they predominated each

00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:26,370
other and there is very thin line

00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:28,410
between them but what you can see on

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,450
this picture is that the governance is

00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:33,720
more business oriented and identity

00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:35,850
management is more technology and it's

00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,640
all achieved by role-based access

00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,270
control Shawn doing over the role basic

00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,640
six console

00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,770
Alysse do i know what role-based access

00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,350
control is can't could do I know so I've

00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:48,300
spent years of my career down in role

00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:50,460
based access control so I mean that's a

00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,200
well known standard and access

00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:55,440
management circles been in use for

00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:58,020
decades and I got enough gray hair in on

00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,060
my head and to know that I've been and

00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,340
that's in this space for a long time so

00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,010
yeah I know what robux access control is

00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:07,410
and so this slide is kind of gives you

00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:10,440
an example there's a specification that

00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:12,000
governs it ANSI and Seitz 359 and so

00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,890
it's more than just using rolls you've

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,020
got things like users roles permissions

00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:19,020
and sessions there's various ways of

00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,460
applying these controls as you can see

00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,560
on this slide you've got our back one

00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,290
which is higher core rolls are back twos

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,120
static separation of duties which is

00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:29,970
mutual exclusion constraints between

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,700
assigned roles which is to say hey I can

00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,080
be I can be assigned a manager I can be

00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,670
assigned administrator but I could never

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,200
be both of at the same time because

00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:39,330
there's some toxic relationship there

00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,490
there's our back three which is dynamic

00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:43,650
separation of duties which is mutual

00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,420
exclusion constraints between activated

00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:48,120
roles so I might be assigned both of

00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,950
those roles manager and an administrator

00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,140
but I can't activate them in the session

00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:55,140
at the same time so yeah I've got a

00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:57,360
pretty good idea about that yes Joanie

00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:59,400
you surprised me and I see that you are

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,610
really excited about their own basic sis

00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:05,040
control and using their own businesses

00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:08,010
control together with the the defined

00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:12,330
policies which tell you about the

00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:14,910
actions which should happen you can

00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:17,580
achieve the governance features like for

00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:19,740
example policy if there is a policy that

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:23,670
their role can be assigned only for one

00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:26,430
user and then someone tries to assign

00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:30,750
this role to another one there is a

00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:33,240
situation that you have to resolve the

00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,700
conflict so you have to choose only the

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,600
one user which will help this role

00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:43,680
assigned at the end so this is what the

00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:47,190
governance basically is of the solution

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,710
or we work on together is based on the

00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:53,250
open source identity management system

00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:55,019
called midpoint it is implemented and

00:08:53,250 --> 00:09:00,300
we were under the apache software

00:08:55,019 --> 00:09:03,329
license 2.0 have you ever heard about

00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,939
the midpoint yeah actually my boss told

00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:09,720
me to look at that a while back so yeah

00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:11,699
I did an evaluation of it and so you

00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,579
know it's a java application it uses

00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:16,500
Java version 8 it runs inside of a

00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:18,930
servlet container any compliant servlet

00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,860
container will do it uses a relational

00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,290
database

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,300
it comes in vetted it comes with an

00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,100
embedded database but in production

00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,579
you'll want to have a relational

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,959
database to store the master copy of

00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:33,810
users and policies that it's controlling

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,689
and then it has you know as far as the

00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,250
way the way it works it uses spring

00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:40,470
Spring Framework you know it's built on

00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:43,230
top of a bunch of well-known Java

00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:46,079
principles best practices it uses Apache

00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:48,930
wicked which is a well thought of UI

00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:52,079
framework for its UI component and it

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:55,230
uses a framework called con ID for its

00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:56,850
connectors and so that's kind of one of

00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,639
the cool things about midpoint is that

00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:01,709
the connector framework is is outside of

00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:04,350
midpoint so the con ID if you build a

00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:05,970
connector that's compliant with con ID

00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,279
and that connector can be used across

00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,259
different identity management systems so

00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:13,529
for example maybe you have as a target

00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:15,750
resource rack F and you know a legacy

00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:17,610
system running in and so you could build

00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,800
a racket connector and then it could be

00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,360
used across any identity management

00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,519
system that that's compliant with that

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,740
framework as far as the architecture

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:29,009
it's a well-defined architecture it's

00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,720
comprised of five subsystems at the top

00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:32,939
is the GUI subsystem which I already

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,680
said was Apache wicked that's the unit

00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:37,079
user interface it sits on top of the

00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,660
model and that's every system that

00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:42,120
interacts with midpoint will go through

00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,100
that model and that's where the identity

00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,430
management services security and user

00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:49,800
account mappings reside and and then

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,930
those two top level components comprise

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,819
you know the order considered the high

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:55,529
level components and those are highly

00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:58,470
customizable and then that sits on top

00:10:55,529 --> 00:11:00,809
of the core and the core is the lower

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:03,000
components those are our low-level

00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:05,309
components they're configured they're

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,690
considered to be configurable and that's

00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:10,080
the repository that provide

00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:11,070
subsystem and the infrastructure so yeah

00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,440
I've taken a look at it

00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:16,920
I'm impressed so you've all heard about

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:20,460
the midpoint so before we start with

00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:24,960
demo I think is so important to make

00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:28,080
some main in combination resources is

00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:30,660
resource in the meaning program using

00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,970
midpoint is the largest system where the

00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,460
accounts will be created so is the

00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:39,570
tARGIT application or third system like

00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:45,830
UNIX system or ad or open LDS LDAP or

00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:50,340
some other application like Google and

00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:52,590
our connector is something what is used

00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:55,350
to achieve the provisioning to the

00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:58,620
target system basically is the protocol

00:11:55,350 --> 00:12:01,020
transfer translator it is connected to

00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:03,060
the midpoint and using this connector

00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:06,150
you can then create accounts and all

00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:11,130
these stuff in the target system then

00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:15,720
the second is other users and accounts

00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:19,560
user is a term used for the identity

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:22,950
which is created in midpoint and account

00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,320
is the name used for the account

00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:27,810
existing directory in the target system

00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:31,200
like Active Directory or open or Deborah

00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:32,640
Linux system or anything else so if you

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,920
can build a connector for it you can

00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:38,610
manage it yes exactly

00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:42,390
then of the provisioning or these well

00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:45,120
this is what we do so in our demo there

00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:47,640
is a HR system where we create a new

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,690
account and then pulling the information

00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:53,850
from HR system we create the user in

00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:57,150
midpoint and according to the position

00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:59,130
or for which the user was hired we will

00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:04,260
create the accounts in charge

00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:05,790
applications okay that's good so all

00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,740
right so we got to stuff running in a

00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:10,800
demo environment and that which is

00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,070
depicted by this or this screen right

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,180
here

00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:17,610
and so I already told you that midpoint

00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,459
was Java and so it's running inside of a

00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,860
web application archive

00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:24,170
I'm going to patch you guys so I'm going

00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,639
to I'm going to run that in Tomcat you

00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,730
could use whatever your favorite server

00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:30,589
container is and and so that's the main

00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,910
system and then it's talking already

00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:34,639
mentioned that it needs a relational

00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,439
database so I like PostgreSQL that's my

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,670
favorite so that's what I used in this

00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:39,740
environment it's running natively on

00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,679
that same you know by the way this is on

00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:44,300
a virtual machine running

00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:47,059
infrastructure-as-a-service inside our

00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:50,809
CenturyLink data center in New York and

00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:51,949
so PostgreSQL is running natively on

00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:54,589
that same machine it's just a

00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:57,139
proof-of-concept environment and but

00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:58,579
midpoint could use you know it's

00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:00,889
flexible in terms of what relational

00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:03,129
database it uses and then you can see

00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:07,249
off to the left we've got three

00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:09,410
resources that are being managed and so

00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:11,779
the two on the bottom you can see at the

00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,509
very bottom we've got open LDAP which is

00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:15,529
running natively on that machine and

00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:18,529
that's stimulating say in Active

00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:22,069
Directory and then in the middle on the

00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:24,619
left you've got Google Apps so we've got

00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:25,879
the Google Apps connector and so at this

00:14:24,619 --> 00:14:28,399
demo environment we're going to be

00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:29,959
creating and deleting accounts inside of

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,910
the cloud with the Google Apps connector

00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:35,209
and then finally on the top we've got

00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:39,579
the inbound resource which is a

00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:43,069
peoplesoft human resource system it's

00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:45,019
we're using the oracle human capital

00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:47,029
management connector that's in midpoint

00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:49,730
and so the way that we're going to demo

00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:51,860
this for you today is that we're going

00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:55,730
to be consuming that xml file and that

00:14:51,860 --> 00:15:00,249
xml files in the schema of the Oracle

00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:00,249
HCM system so if they define that schema

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:11,810
so the way that the okay so the question

00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:15,019
is is is the inbound resource is it is

00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:19,070
is midpoint query and HCM so if it is it

00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:22,670
interrogating HCM or is the is it is it

00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:24,790
pushing you know is it pushing in so the

00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:28,060
answer is it depends on the the

00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:30,440
capabilities of the target system and so

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,570
connectors you know we talked about

00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,399
connectors and and really a connector is

00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:36,589
just a protocol adapter and it's a very

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,620
simple unintelligent component and so

00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:42,740
it's it's got say six methods add update

00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,480
delete search and sync and then there's

00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,399
a live sync and so if the resource can

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,680
do a live thing then this can do a live

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:52,240
sync if it can't then it could be just a

00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:55,250
push where you know it there's like a

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,959
task that runs periodically but then

00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:00,800
pulls that and updates it so in this

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:03,110
case for this demo environment we don't

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,820
have the budget to pay the license fee

00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:08,420
to have an Oracle HCM system running

00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:10,459
live so we're stimulating this with this

00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,930
file and then we're going to go in there

00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:13,610
you already saw us pull it up in the

00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:15,230
beginning we're going in and we're going

00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,600
to edit it and we're going to we're

00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,670
going to create events say hiring an

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,060
employee firing an employee things like

00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:26,000
that so the answer is depends on the

00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:29,240
resource and in this case I'm not

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,670
exactly sure if I'm not sure if I'm sure

00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:35,750
it can do a lot I usually explain

00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:39,200
squaring the target system yeah that's

00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:42,200
the best way to do it for sure okay good

00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,700
question all right so so again we've got

00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,839
this XML file we're going to be going in

00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,520
there we're going to editing it and

00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:48,500
we're going to be simulating this in the

00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:51,320
real world no one would ever edit an XML

00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,180
file to hire an employee we're just

00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:58,670
doing that for this so that we can make

00:16:53,180 --> 00:17:01,370
these demo scenarios happen we will show

00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:03,920
different use cases so it will be on

00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:06,400
onboarding of new identity then we will

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:10,100
show the taste of the notifications also

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:13,340
approvals escalation validations

00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:16,520
we'll also segregation of duty and there

00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:18,590
are at the end certifications like

00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,080
access for those guys over to the right

00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:24,430
three Fugees on the mountain or those

00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,430
who are employees yeah

00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:31,610
so the first they're the scenarios the

00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,640
first is the unburdening of new employee

00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:37,210
of with the account activation then we

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,840
will show the self-service than the new

00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:45,470
employee deserve your request an roles

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:48,230
but as he he doesn't have appropriately

00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:52,250
derive so the these roles go through the

00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:56,000
approval and then when someone doesn't

00:17:52,250 --> 00:18:00,680
approve the request there is an

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,480
escalation process then next scenario is

00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,540
role assignments for example some

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,810
manager needs to assign permissions for

00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:12,050
the user and on this industry or video

00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:14,630
show the segregation of Duty the next

00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:17,810
scenario is deputy and last but not

00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:20,870
least Easter access certification so the

00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:23,330
first scenario is onboarding new items

00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:27,830
through hard worker yeah we are going to

00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:35,500
hurry even like this on the work you at

00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:35,500
home okay so let's hire Larry can go

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:56,390
so what's Hera worried we can see a bit

00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:59,580
is the Isabelle expert from HTM file and

00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:01,650
we can see that these are personal

00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:04,560
information about Larry and here our

00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:09,270
assignment we can see that Larry both so

00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:14,280
hard like developer in Kabul and evil

00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:16,940
heart also as developer you know Java

00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:21,450
wait you're gonna let Larry code Java

00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:23,700
seems so he's a stooge yes that it was

00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:34,080
hard like Java the ultra I can't do

00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:41,700
nothing yes yes it's in the Oracle HCM

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:45,410
schema format yes so now when we look

00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,410
into our identity management system

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:58,890
we can see that there is no worry and

00:19:53,930 --> 00:20:02,309
Larry was hired as developer in Java and

00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:08,120
and COBOL and we can see the dough there

00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:10,830
is just a development department but no

00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,530
Department for Java developer or COBOL

00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:15,180
that order so was higher learning so

00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:17,520
you're going to construct organizations

00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:22,740
in the target resource as part of this

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:26,040
import yes and here we have the HTM

00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:32,250
resource which is the motion for the

00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:36,240
Oracle HCM target HR application we can

00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:38,720
see here all the accounts we can see

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,640
that three accounts are either already

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:45,090
created in the midpoint and we can see

00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:48,150
that there is new account which doesn't

00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:52,200
exist in my voice so now we can import

00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:55,080
him okay

00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:58,559
although it was imported and we can see

00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,900
that there are some personal information

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:05,160
and we can see that Larry was assigned

00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:09,270
to three roles it's COBOL Java and basic

00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:12,390
role we can but we can see that he has

00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:16,500
only one account and is the HTM account

00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:20,490
from the HR system no other accounts

00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:23,340
were created yet and it's because what

00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:24,980
he needs to activate his account first

00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:28,650
how do you do that

00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:32,340
he wants a notification mail was sent to

00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:35,010
the Larry but what are intolerable yes

00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:37,050
sure I wanted to show also that there is

00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:41,400
the organizational structure which was

00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:44,040
created during the lawyers in court and

00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:49,230
but we can see that there are no members

00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:52,650
so he was not assigned to the COBOL and

00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:55,170
Java Department because he didn't have

00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:58,490
an activating his account it so what

00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:58,490
activated his account

00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:12,830
so we don't have an SMTP server setup so

00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:15,050
we're going to right now these

00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:17,600
notifications are going to a while so

00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:19,940
does simulation so we can see that the

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,910
notification mail was sent to Larry's

00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:26,780
with the register video activation link

00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:28,700
and also mail was sent to the system

00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,290
administrator to see that something is

00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:34,850
happening in his application

00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:43,040
so let's activate Larry sure you want to

00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:46,010
do that sorry okay we need to set

00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,170
password to activate these accounts for

00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:52,810
example so where he clicks on the ways

00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:52,810
I'm set to the password yes

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,220
that's where polls did you not put like

00:23:01,889 --> 00:23:08,370
the bang on the end so there's midpoint

00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:11,510
of courses password policies both in

00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:13,740
this in the users that are stored in in

00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:17,700
midpoint itself and in the target

00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:20,330
resource but this is very stressful for

00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,330
policy

00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:32,909
okay crisis mr. character probably okay

00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:36,349
now the second mail was sent to the

00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:40,789
Larry and it's the confirmation now

00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:46,349
Larry has to confirm the activation to

00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:53,309
be able to log into the identity

00:23:46,349 --> 00:23:59,009
management system and now Instagram

00:23:53,309 --> 00:24:02,190
should be activated that's right okay he

00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:05,369
is now able to log into the midpoint and

00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:07,289
we can see that he was assigned to Taco

00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:10,499
Bell and Java developer defied

00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:13,979
Department and he got also end user role

00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:16,580
and basic girl if you look into his

00:24:13,979 --> 00:24:20,729
profile we now see that there are three

00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:23,609
projections account was created in open

00:24:20,729 --> 00:24:26,279
LDAP and also he was added as a member

00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:29,749
of group COBOL groups cobble and Java

00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:34,619
and he was also created in Google Apps

00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:41,999
so is he really there and so we good our

00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:45,259
admin console and Google refresh sign

00:24:41,999 --> 00:24:45,259
ends at admin there

00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:51,570
so you got an account for me

00:24:53,390 --> 00:25:00,440
that there he is Larry so I could do the

00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:05,710
same thing with the LDAP but I hope you

00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,710
build with me I'm a skeptic yeah I know

00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:16,790
so in this first use case we shall

00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:19,850
onboarding of new identity where the

00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:25,010
account was activated to we're activated

00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:27,020
up after the Larry confirms said his

00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:29,840
password and confirm the activation of

00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:32,630
his account we show also the

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:37,400
notification mechanism which can be used

00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:41,240
for any other events and we show that

00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:45,860
the roles were assigned or activated

00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:51,799
only after the Larry activates his

00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:54,080
account the next khc self-service so it

00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:57,919
means that now we are working as a Larry

00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:00,429
and Larry meets or he realized that he

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:05,059
needs some root access to machines where

00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:07,490
initial development went very to the

00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:15,340
developer where he does the development

00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:18,650
so he needs to request a new role for it

00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:21,320
so we are working as a real Larry and we

00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:24,910
are going to request a role operator to

00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:28,370
be able to log in as a root to a machine

00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:30,880
which are given route to Larry oh you

00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,880
need it

00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:41,750
he thinks he needs it okay so he will

00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:46,620
request it huh okay oh we can see that

00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:49,620
the approval started and in the profile

00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:52,680
we can see that new role was not

00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:56,880
assigned because it is waiting for the

00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:59,970
approval in this scenario we have

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:03,030
configured the multi-level approval so

00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,780
first the first level is security

00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:07,830
officer

00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:13,950
so first the security officer has to has

00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:18,480
to has to approve the request so the

00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:25,470
security officer usual so I will login

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:27,930
as you and here we can see the work

00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:32,670
items and we can see that you have one

00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:36,120
approval request from Larry and he is

00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:40,140
requesting roll operator because he

00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:42,390
thinks he needs a root access Who am I

00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:46,410
the last one who approves this or no

00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:49,020
there's another letter also put in there

00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:54,380
that I'm skeptical you can put yeah just

00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:58,410
I'm skeptical that he's gonna say I am

00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:59,670
skeptical and he does and we're going to

00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,620
give him that but since it's not really

00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:03,300
me that's the final I'm going to kick

00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,580
the can down the next guy let them

00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:07,320
decide okay I'm not going to give a

00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:10,050
money you know there is no security

00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:14,630
there is another level of approval and

00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:18,300
it's a approval from application owner

00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:21,180
I'm mid point developer I'm the

00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:25,590
application owner so I will walk in as

00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:29,010
me and here I can see that I have won

00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:31,560
approval item and that you actually

00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:36,390
approved it but with comment than you

00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:40,700
are skeptical your arms too so these

00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:44,100
approval has a deadline and it's set for

00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:48,960
for the day my use case for one minute

00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:55,560
so if I miss the deadline or it will be

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:57,720
escalated so if or if some person who is

00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:01,110
responsible for their parole is on

00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:03,840
vacation disapproval is escalated so

00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:08,460
let's look first on the Larry's profile

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:11,840
and we can see that even if you approve

00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:16,550
the role there is no operator role and

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:20,550
meanwhile or the my work items are is so

00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:22,530
always so it was a good line yeah you

00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:25,170
didn't do it in time so yeah I'm very

00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:28,770
slow okay yeah I'm sorry you had better

00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:31,290
things to do probably it was it was so

00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:34,350
escalated tool so who's a desk away -

00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:36,510
yes manner it so yeah in this case it's

00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:41,940
administrative I'll configure well yeah

00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:44,340
he was a CEO or yeah anyone so here we

00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:47,550
can see that the already now it was

00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:51,960
assigned to me to auto battle assemble

00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:53,940
as I was so lazy and slow it was

00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,290
escalated to the meeting so this is an

00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,090
example of what happens in the real

00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:58,860
world right somebody goes on leave or

00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:00,420
they they don't they don't answer the

00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:03,210
email they go missing and then meanwhile

00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:05,030
people are sitting around and you know

00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:07,710
and they're not able to do their job so

00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:09,930
this is an example of governance word

00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:11,720
escalated and someone didn't do what

00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:16,410
they're supposed to do so it escalates

00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:20,280
automatically yes and now when the

00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:23,010
administrator approves his access we can

00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:25,860
see in Larry's profile that there is new

00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:31,440
assignment for the role operator so he

00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:34,980
does have room yeah he does so in the UK

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,810
we show the self-service requesting the

00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:39,320
roll and then approval process with

00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:43,380
multi-level approval stages and

00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:46,160
escalation when someone who should

00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:49,590
approve is not available or is too lazy

00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:53,060
it's so good when you have someone who

00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:56,750
is very slow you know you you can

00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:58,550
you're quite a scenario and you packed a

00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:12,410
lot in there a couple questions in the

00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:14,450
back yes sir are using organizational

00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:18,280
physics for example organizational

00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:21,170
structure you can you can set that any

00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:23,540
anyone from the organizational structure

00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:26,750
or from Department or managers of the

00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:28,160
organizational unit all clinical so the

00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:30,650
question was is there a way to have

00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:32,540
approval for a group so that's a good

00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:38,680
question and the answer is yes you can

00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:46,760
another question in the back okay thanks

00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:48,080
okay does a user interface support

00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,900
two-factor authentication is the

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:53,660
question not directly that you can have

00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:58,130
some single sign-on server before it and

00:31:53,660 --> 00:32:01,220
they will do it for you but this mid

00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:06,850
point doesn't now support only lvl have

00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:06,850
authentication and basic authentication

00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:17,120
so the third use case is when the

00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:21,020
manager who is small are you okay

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,560
good mo let me look at him it's a little

00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,940
irritating

00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:30,650
mo is the ladies manager needs to assign

00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:34,040
him in some neural because he realized

00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:38,120
that he needs someone in his team who

00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:42,800
will be responsible for another role yes

00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:45,520
okay Larry needs the Audis role so his

00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:50,150
manager is going to give it to him yes

00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:56,390
Mordor yes mo assign the auditor all but

00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:58,760
not for him but for Larry so here we can

00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:01,250
see that Oh

00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:07,490
it's not possible to request there are

00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:10,130
some conflicts ah I think it's this

00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:12,470
video we're going back to static

00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:15,650
separation yeah and also you told that

00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:17,330
he cannot be an operator well so we've

00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:19,940
got we've established a segregation of

00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:21,710
duty constraint between operator which

00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:26,500
would be say rude on a machine and

00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:29,060
auditor so which is a way of preventing

00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:31,070
you know bad things from happening right

00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:33,860
of creating a conflict of interest

00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:36,440
because if you are auditor and admin and

00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:38,360
you could cover your tracks right and so

00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,880
that's a way you know again it's

00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,980
governance of controlling your identity

00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:47,260
management system via policies to remain

00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:50,570
compliant so I think Maul knows better

00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:52,910
what Larry should be so Moe doesn't want

00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:59,300
Larry to have the operator role you can

00:33:52,910 --> 00:34:00,620
allocate he'll Magnum auditor okay so we

00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:04,400
unassigned the operator and assigning

00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:07,310
honor yes okay and as the more you so

00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:10,909
Larry so manager of you we don't need

00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:13,970
the approval process here because it's

00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:17,149
fine when manager assigned directly in

00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:20,149
our scenario so and now we can see in

00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:22,820
large profile that he is albita and he

00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:25,460
doesn't have operator role play more are

00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:26,929
you are you okay I'm a little sad well

00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:29,200
you still got Java there and that

00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:33,470
worries me

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:36,470
okay so balls alright the Java okay so

00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:39,590
in this scenario we showed the

00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:41,780
segregation of duty relation when the

00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:44,960
user has assigned they're all vehicles

00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:48,590
in conflict with another all the next

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:51,200
scenario is so that the mall is going to

00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:53,270
I think to Apache cone in Miami Mo's

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,010
here he's a veggie car I heard so

00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:58,490
where's yeah that guy owes me money

00:34:55,010 --> 00:35:04,490
oh you should find him yeah have you

00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:11,869
guys seen him around okay so

00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:14,930
is on the beach so mo as he's attending

00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:19,040
the Apache con he is not able to perform

00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:21,830
his word so he needs to make delegation

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:29,570
and he will delegate his work to curly

00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:31,430
but what try if Chloe has some right -

00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:37,190
curly can't even sign on right now no

00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:43,330
curly Colonel Tigh no okay so we can we

00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:43,330
can delegate most rights to curly

00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:54,410
okay and I think we should delegate all

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:59,200
right it's most it's his decision I

00:35:54,410 --> 00:36:03,260
guess I mean curly is his right-hand man

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:06,080
okay so the scenario was about the

00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:09,350
deputy even for example some manager Leo

00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:13,730
for vacation or go to the Apache calm

00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:18,440
and then he needs someone to do his sort

00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:22,010
of a while he's not available

00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:27,770
during his vacation or during the

00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:31,820
conference reason yeah cosmos the

00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:36,859
manager of the administrator decided to

00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:40,490
start the certification campaign what's

00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:44,480
a certification campaign you know for

00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:48,200
example you have users and they are

00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:51,230
assigned to some roles and so sometimes

00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:53,450
you need to review these assignments if

00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:55,100
they have only appropriate roles and

00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:57,890
that's a way of figuring out what

00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:02,930
everybody has nobody has access to and

00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:06,040
yeah so we will create a campaign and we

00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:06,040
will start the campaign

00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:14,589
and as small ease on the conference

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:18,339
curly has to do his work

00:37:14,589 --> 00:37:21,880
oh he can sign on and now look he's

00:37:18,339 --> 00:37:23,410
going now he can sign got all the most

00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:27,550
power basically yes

00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:31,839
and here you can see all those words

00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:35,140
direct reports yes the assignments in

00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:36,460
his department or in most Department

00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:39,099
working you don't so it's an opportunity

00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:41,859
to review every assignment and to accept

00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:44,500
or revoke those assignments individually

00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:46,540
so do know who is really I'm doing no

00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,700
but I mean we did

00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:55,920
why is he got two names that are the

00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:59,319
same we should get rid of them yeah and

00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,970
also here you still learn are you okay

00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:03,790
with Coble yeah he can do he can do

00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:06,640
trouble okay and you are not okay you

00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:11,760
should do Jim on by can you or can you

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:21,760
just do just says a stooge I mean it's

00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:23,920
okay so on he still and use it so multi

00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,810
or not the moment bad girl we did

00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:29,410
decision and now it's up to

00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:32,410
Administrator to start the remediation

00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:35,079
process so some period of time goes by

00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:38,020
that elapses and all the managers are

00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:42,270
able to review the reports and then

00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:45,700
after that time then we close it yes

00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:48,280
here are some times and when we open it

00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:50,560
we can see that there are more users and

00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,530
more assignments which we need to decide

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,690
but it is about it's according to

00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:58,240
Department and the manager should do the

00:38:55,690 --> 00:39:01,660
decision show so for us are important

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:05,290
only Development Department and here we

00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:09,270
can see the decisions so let's close the

00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:09,270
stage and start the remediation process

00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:14,680
so remediation is where those policies

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:19,119
are pushed down into the target

00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:23,280
resources yes going through the policy

00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,280
and when something happened

00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:31,730
what see it was this villain villians I

00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:39,410
felt build it right I told you we should

00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:41,530
that guy not so anxious yeah okay it's

00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:47,420
not doing job anymore okay I feel better

00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:52,250
good he can do COBOL all right okay Adam

00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:55,310
we will do it so this love this case was

00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:59,690
about the access certification when we

00:39:55,310 --> 00:40:02,060
need to recheck the access rights and

00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:04,340
permission for the users it was said

00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:07,610
that the manager of Department do the

00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:12,860
decision about his employees what are

00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:15,980
the benefits of the governance it put

00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:18,380
more security to your identity

00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:23,750
management in it improves our business

00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:29,770
responsiveness and also it'll make the

00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:35,000
processes more faster and safer and

00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:37,150
basically the governance is about the

00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,770
notification right certification

00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:41,810
approvals which can be also multi level

00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:44,810
than escalation on delegation that

00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:47,810
beauty but we can could see also in out

00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:52,520
the demo and the role lifecycle and all

00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:57,440
the try and more and more are you

00:40:52,520 --> 00:41:00,310
convinced them looks pretty good if you

00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,310
have any question

00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:23,109
get time for questions yeah any

00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:26,319
questions from the implement go eat from

00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:35,469
the scratch we started like seven years

00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:40,079
ago it's got a pretty rich history the

00:41:35,469 --> 00:41:45,099
the original creators were in the Sun

00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:47,019
IDM workspace yeah and so they were they

00:41:45,099 --> 00:41:50,319
were well versed in how all that worked

00:41:47,019 --> 00:41:54,640
and then they were part of the open IDM

00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:57,789
window and then and then there was sort

00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:01,209
of a split in terms of how to proceed

00:41:57,789 --> 00:42:04,380
and so they split and so one went one

00:42:01,209 --> 00:42:07,089
way and hasn't went the other way but so

00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:09,579
midpoint is you know as we said in the

00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:12,489
beginning it's apache software - oh it's

00:42:09,579 --> 00:42:14,229
it's there it's fully open source it's

00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:17,650
you know everything is in github there's

00:42:14,229 --> 00:42:20,309
nothing no lockdown you know it's all

00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:22,599
it's all there all the fixes and bugs

00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:27,059
public mailing lists it's all done out

00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:27,059
and open it's a open source project

00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:39,819
it's always been a fashion you analyst

00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:39,819
Apache - dr. V apart from the FARC

00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:54,260
week they went there oh no it was it

00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:56,180
wasn't a força before drop they are they

00:42:54,260 --> 00:43:07,150
are they're locking it down sudo

00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:12,220
open-source can't even get in yeah yep

00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:12,220
you're right any other questions

00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:28,660
all right evolve iam so ok so I work for

00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:31,930
Simon's and and and Catco works for

00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:33,820
evolving and so evolve iam is there they

00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:37,500
are the creators and the authors and the

00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:40,930
main contributors to that project sinus

00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:44,230
were that were the open LDAP guys ok

00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:48,760
and so we've been around since about 99

00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:50,290
and and so open open LDAP is our is our

00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:53,980
main where the corporate sponsors of

00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:55,240
that and so you know but we've been in

00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:58,990
the identity management space for a long

00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:00,910
time so we're now working with evolve

00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:07,330
into you know we're providing commercial

00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:11,980
support for that software yep which is

00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:15,190
what we do for open LDAP any other

00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:19,330
questions all right well thank you very

00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:21,599
