Publication date: 2017-05-18
Playlist: ApacheCon 2017 - Miami
Description: 
	Apache Way: Effective Open Source Project Management - Shane Curcuru, Apache Software Foundation

Join us all day Wednesday for six expert sessions about the Apache Way, the ASF's tried and proven set of behaviors and practices for effective open source project management that encourages long-lived successful projects.

Come learn from core committers and officers at the ASF how we help support the 170+ Apache projects in their successes, as well as how you can get involved either as an individual or a company in the ASF.  Learn the best ways to engage with projects, and how to successfully structure a project to come to the Apache Incubator.

This session will introduce the core concepts and inform you on which sessions during the day are the best fit for you or your organization to attend!

good morning hope everybody was enjoying

00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,750
Miami last night it sounds like we have

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,069
a looks like we have a good crowd it

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,300
looks like everybody's awake which is

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:12,210
great because sometimes later in the

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,250
conference we're not quite as awake I'm

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,350
here to introduce both my talk as well

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,550
as an entire track of talks in this room

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,510
all day today about the Apache way which

00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,760
has a lot of different meanings but

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,039
really what it means to you is effective

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,710
open source project management it's not

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:33,899
just part of the ASF it's a good way of

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:35,670
doing things really there were a lot of

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,680
Apache way talks in the past and I was

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,420
trying to think of what you want to

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,640
learn about the Apache way that makes

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,969
Apache projects so successful and so

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,719
long lives and it's really the behaviors

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:51,480
that a community has and works with

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,649
together to produce a result it's how

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,809
they do it that helps our communities be

00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:59,910
successful be welcoming be long-lived

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:02,039
encourage new encourage new contributors

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,939
because really our point is to have long

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:08,100
live projects and bringing in new

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,720
contributors is the most important thing

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,770
you can possibly have because then they

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,330
will help you continue the project and

00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:18,150
for those of you who you who are

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,790
committed on an Apache project these are

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,560
required behaviors and this is this is

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,780
part of what the Board expects projects

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,189
to do in some cases some people some

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,720
projects have a specific way that's

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,750
different if they can explain how that

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,320
works better okay then the board will be

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,909
fine with that

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,340
but you need to explain why you're doing

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,689
something better and different so that

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,570
we can evaluate it and maybe we'll add

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:44,579
it to what the ASF considers the Apache

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:47,369
way so today is a whole tract of curated

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,450
talks about the Apache way from

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:50,549
different perspectives

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,189
a lot of conferences in the past we've

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,360
had a single talk on it which doesn't it

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,619
kind of gives you a little bit of all

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,719
the pieces but it doesn't answer your

00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,159
questions about how projects work it

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,070
doesn't answer your questions about how

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,649
new contributors should do this and it

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,479
doesn't really help so today we have

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:07,710
this right after this will be a coffee

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,730
break which I'm looking forward to

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:14,069
myself at 10:15 in this room we have a

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:17,430
tale of two developers which will be a

00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:19,050
formal dialogue between two employees at

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,450
a large company that I'm not going to

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,790
name one of whom is an experienced

00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,060
Apache contributor and one of whom is an

00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:29,430
employee told to go join us project and

00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:32,160
the teaching process of how a corporate

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:35,849
contributor as an employee can learn how

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:39,269
to work with match projects at 11:15 we

00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:40,769
have from dev to user to the Apache Way

00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:43,230
with Steve Blackman who is here in the

00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:45,989
in the room right now he's going to tell

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,720
a story about how an existing project

00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:51,480
community outside of Apache came to

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,629
Apache came to the incubator and changed

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,780
how they work together as a community to

00:02:54,629 --> 00:03:00,150
better work with Apache and to find ways

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,970
to draw in new people some simple things

00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,470
and some harder things and of course we

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,980
save the the tough stuff for before

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,790
lunch

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:13,370
at 12:15 we have a panel discussion on

00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:16,739
software is easy but people are hard so

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:18,720
all the great coders on github who think

00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,040
the latest technical challenge is like

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,920
that's that's the hardest thing I'm

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,269
going to solve no the hardest thing

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,519
you're always going to solve in an

00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:28,459
interesting situation is how to get

00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,690
people to work together on that

00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:35,250
technical challenge or that voting

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:38,069
campaign or anything really lunch is on

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,510
your own today and then after lunch come

00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:41,760
back please because we have another

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,769
panel discussion the Apache way for

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,750
business with Nick birch who's given

00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:49,220
he's a very engaging speaker so he will

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:52,080
keep you awake after lunch I guarantee

00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,340
how your company who might want to have

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,189
a project that you want to bring to

00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,110
Apache how your company needs to think

00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:59,640
about structuring the project not just

00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,610
your employees but your marketing

00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:05,790
department your product manager how

00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:07,920
you're going to transfer control and and

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:11,519
gain the benefits of coming to Apache

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,849
and at 3:30

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:18,120
we have Sharon foga who will be talking

00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:20,340
about how contributions in Apache are

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,440
not just code everything else is

00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,680
important to documentation answering

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,229
user questions on the you

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,930
list or providing helpful bug reports

00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:31,000
are all things that are valued and ways

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,470
that you as an individual whether you're

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,919
an employee or whether you're working on

00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:37,509
your own or you're your college student

00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:40,539
the little ways you can get started and

00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:41,650
get some recognition in our projects and

00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:45,789
of course this evening we have a couple

00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:47,830
of keynotes some talks of IOT from the

00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:50,110
Apache IOT conference here the machine

00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:52,389
learning and then a great talk about the

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,850
last keynote is related to this how

00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:58,080
Comcast and their developers and some of

00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:00,370
their projects that were donated to BASF

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,630
got some efficiencies from working in

00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:06,070
our way and of course at 5:50 after the

00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,020
keynotes stay tuned for the Lightning

00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:10,270
talks that Jim and I will be hosting

00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,680
which will be guaranteed pend five

00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:16,840
minutes you can talk about whatever you

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:19,000
want but no slides and we time you so

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,130
let's talk about our topic here the

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,349
apache way and i think the important

00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:26,470
thing is defining the behaviors but

00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:30,360
first let's take one pause for apache

00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:32,949
way history i reviewed most of the past

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,690
probably 10 years of presentations about

00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:36,159
the apache way and they all start with

00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,340
how the ASF was created in the

00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:41,169
corporation how PMC's were organized and

00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,220
we we sort of thought through the rules

00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:47,199
or we we grew the rules as we did things

00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:50,830
and the history of the organization our

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:55,210
projects in the way but that's not what

00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:57,639
I want to talk about because what is

00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:00,220
history matter now and you come here to

00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:01,659
learn what you can do how you can make

00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,210
your project better how you can get

00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:06,340
involved I think what's important here

00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,289
is learning what the behaviors are

00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,210
learning the actual actionable

00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:15,340
information as we'd say in a corporate

00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:17,259
speak slide deck what can I do to help

00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:20,560
my project gain new contributors to make

00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:22,150
it more friendly to answer the board's

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,240
question because they were upset with us

00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,289
for something so I don't want to talk

00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,930
about the history I don't talk about the

00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:31,900
past or the rationale here now I do have

00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,490
a question we're just skipping all that

00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,680
history in all the past

00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,150
information do you think that's a

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,580
completely good thing or do you think

00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:42,160
we're missing something if we just skip

00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,270
that and you just want the actionable

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,250
information or do you want the history

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:49,919
too so that's that's something I'm just

00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,360
going to leave you to think about

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,880
throughout the day I think a lot of our

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,919
talks later in the day will enter those

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,259
questions for the points they bring up

00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:00,669
like Steve will talk about we had a

00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:02,680
great project community what came to

00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:06,039
Apache and we needed to change things

00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,190
and after we did it oh that's why this

00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:10,509
is better we got more people interested

00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:13,389
because you learn the history but the

00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:16,750
history doesn't doesn't help you unless

00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:20,500
you've seen the actual example so let's

00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:24,610
move on and we have a menu of services

00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:28,330
today so what behaviors we want to talk

00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:30,370
about so you can call me lazy if you

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:33,430
want but I'm gonna make you do the work

00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:38,139
because Apache is participatory so I

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:39,219
have five topics and then questions to

00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:40,289
answer is not really topic that's just

00:07:39,219 --> 00:07:44,050
Q&A at the end

00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:47,889
community is a topic over code which we

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:50,949
we say we believe in merit recognizing

00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:54,699
and individuals work and what comes from

00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:56,440
that open development which the ASF

00:07:54,699 --> 00:08:00,520
requires for everything that's just how

00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:03,900
we do any artwork decision-making how we

00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:07,150
get consensus and how we use votes and

00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:10,000
communication so today we're lucky

00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:11,319
because we can communicate in person we

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,500
can talk to each other but usually we

00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:18,969
write at each other type at each other

00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:20,469
so that's a different aspect so I'm not

00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:22,300
going to do this slide you guys into

00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:24,849
this slide what topics you want to talk

00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,889
about first so there's something that

00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:28,360
somebody has a particular question for

00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:32,649
in their projects or you're just dying

00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:36,209
to hear first or don't make me pick a

00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:39,190
random topic because I do some

00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:40,180
decision-making okay I should have

00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,870
thought of that I should have thought

00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,870
that that would be

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:48,420
not good nice I like that

00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:54,149
decision-making how do we make decisions

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:55,740
in Apache projects so one important

00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:58,200
thing is consensus we talked about how

00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,980
we want to have consensus based decision

00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:05,700
making there is no perfection in

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:10,350
software things are never finished but

00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:12,810
things can get better step-by-step so

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,250
fundamentally at Apache projects our

00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:17,940
goal is to serve the public good with

00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:19,950
software that does stuff so any new

00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,750
features from from you over there or you

00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,970
over there you and back they're probably

00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:27,480
good things so we don't all have to

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:29,580
agree on some new addition as long as

00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,130
it's good enough or as long as it

00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,230
doesn't make our test fail because what

00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:37,680
you might think is really important I

00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:39,330
might not care I may who cares but okay

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,839
you can still add it because you care

00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:45,420
it's valuable to someone so that's why

00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:47,220
we want to get consensus and us like

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,830
okay this is good enough or hey you

00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:53,700
really should think about changing the

00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:54,000
API that way because this would be

00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,760
better

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,410
okay we'll discuss it a little bit so

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,480
that does make you take a little bit

00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:02,640
longer to develop things but you end up

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,560
with a better product in the end

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,209
or sometimes you end up with a bunch of

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,440
things that are put together that some I

00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:11,850
care about and some you care about and

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:15,150
that's okay so when we do need to have

00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:18,930
votes we do have them so they're here

00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:22,770
two quotes about voting in the Apache

00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:26,670
way so the first one is voting is a

00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:27,930
shortcut so Charlie pause voting is the

00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:30,570
plus one minus one

00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:32,130
sometimes plus or minus zero we're plus

00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:35,070
one means yes that's a good idea and

00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:37,770
I'll help you do it minus one means no I

00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:40,740
don't agree and here's why I don't agree

00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,480
you have to say why and there has to be

00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,010
a reason that people can recognize not

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,310
just because you don't like it organisms

00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:50,520
it doesn't help you so voting in the

00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:54,089
shortcut to move consensus forward in a

00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,110
timely manner so that's one aspect of

00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:57,120
voting

00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:01,140
when we're deciding things another

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:08,880
aspect is voting is a way to record an

00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:13,320
official consensus okay so one of these

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,690
quotes is what is good and we want to

00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:20,820
see it in fact we have to see it it's

00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:23,240
required and the other quote is okay but

00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:26,310
it's not really the best way to proceed

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:29,070
anybody know the obvious answer which

00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:34,529
one is definitely right which one is

00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:36,540
important so the second one recording

00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:38,910
official consensus that's required that

00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:42,149
is a good way of using votes when a PMC

00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:45,690
makes a release we have a formal vote

00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:50,459
and that is the PMC as part of the

00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:52,170
foundation saying as there is a role of

00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,640
people working for the foundation this

00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,370
release is appropriate it's a good thing

00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,440
to put out to the public and that or

00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:02,339
just deciding on new commanders or PMC

00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:04,620
members you specifically gain a recorded

00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:06,420
vote that says okay this is done that

00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,520
means those actions you're not doing

00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:12,990
those as yourselves you're doing those

00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:15,000
actions on behalf of the ASM which you

00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,670
know hopefully will never matter but if

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,640
there ever is a lawsuit that is how we

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:22,800
provide a legal shield for everyone it's

00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,740
also how the board can can provide

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,440
oversight to say yes the PMC has decided

00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,910
on this that's what we're doing okay we

00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,800
can see the list we can see the vote

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:34,220
you're done you might change your mind

00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,550
later but you'll record how you do that

00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,529
so the first quote voting is a shortcut

00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:42,149
if if you really can't decide then

00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:43,920
sometimes you need to have a vote say

00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:47,130
okay do we really have enough people who

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,260
will agree and maybe you'll get a lot of

00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:51,540
+1 you get a bunch of plus or minus the

00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:54,350
zeroes people who aren't really happy

00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:58,860
but they don't have a veto then I have a

00:12:54,350 --> 00:13:00,420
reason to stop the new action and there

00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,279
are some projects they say there's some

00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,589
projects that happily use votes for a

00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:06,360
lot of different things on you know the

00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:08,430
new roadmap and a new feature set and

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,930
they like using votes it

00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:12,420
works for their community it's

00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,310
documented and it's expected and that's

00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,620
okay that works for a community great

00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:18,870
but if your community can't get

00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,550
consensus repeatedly and turned falls

00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:26,690
back to using a vote to force something

00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:29,310
through that's not healthy so we want to

00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:32,550
speed up the decision making process

00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:35,580
with vote sometimes well at the Apache

00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:38,100
way there is a timeline for decisions

00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:40,680
and a timeline is not it must be done by

00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,140
the end of the quarter like an accompany

00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:46,020
our timeline is you can't finish this

00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:52,290
decision until at least 72 hours have

00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:54,870
passed so we all come from around the

00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:57,089
world I don't there's anybody actually

00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,440
from Australia or Down Under or the Far

00:13:57,089 --> 00:13:59,850
East in the room right now who lives

00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,880
there but we have several little meta

00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:05,910
Patrick on ensuring that any vote is

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,339
open for at least 72 hours means that

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:10,500
people can see the vote have time to

00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:18,779
respond even if it's over a weekend or

00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:20,970
something yes yes um yes you should you

00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:23,190
should be cautious of major holidays in

00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:25,440
different geographies that your

00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:27,480
community has and it's certainly always

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,080
good to wait longer than 72 hours if

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,610
it's a you know big decision it's also a

00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,900
good reason why you have a discussion

00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,720
thread if you want to have this crazy

00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,790
new architecture well discuss it for a

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,850
while and then once people have kind of

00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:43,770
said okay that's good we've solidified

00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,510
some things it's not completely done but

00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,690
it's closed and people have had time to

00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:50,310
talk about it then have a vote thread

00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:52,620
right because people have had time to

00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:55,110
digest and the people we're talking

00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:59,339
about are from around the world from

00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:01,890
different backgrounds so this is a

00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:05,700
complete opposite from the corporate

00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:08,040
world many of us work in there are no

00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:12,959
deadlines or they're there very few

00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:14,940
deadlines at Apache because we as a

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,670
project don't have any deadlines to get

00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:21,029
something done by accept those that we

00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:23,769
agree to do together so

00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:25,420
we all volunteer from from the Apache

00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:27,459
perspective you're all volunteering

00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:30,250
you're all being super nice to give us

00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:34,120
all this great code we can't ask you to

00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:35,920
do something on time so if the community

00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,019
decides yes we want to get this release

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,449
out by X because our users want it and

00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:42,699
we're going to put the effort in great

00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:51,399
but that's up to the community to decide

00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:55,410
together so that brings us on to back to

00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:59,010
the menu so we've done decision-making

00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:00,850
so where where do we want to go today

00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:05,519
not sure if I should use that phrase

00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:11,680
here but communication okay

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:12,940
indication how we write so like I said

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,370
we're lucky today to be able to talk in

00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:17,199
person and there's a lot of richness but

00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:19,510
almost all the time we're typing and

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:22,839
we're typing from our little offices or

00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:25,630
our you know beachside patio if we're

00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:27,209
here in Miami or from our our bed at

00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,589
night after every else's gone to sleep

00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:30,670
so it's important remember that when

00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:32,949
everybody else is reading their little

00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:39,459
screen they're in a very different world

00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:41,860
so don't be a jerk that's you know

00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:43,329
they're really cheap way to say it and

00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,760
this is the way that many of the early

00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:47,290
Apache ways slide said it avoid the

00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,709
poisonous people now we can't always

00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:52,329
avoid them we like I can't and you maybe

00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:54,940
can't because they send mails and

00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:59,560
they're in your list but we as a

00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:01,660
community can work to mitigate the

00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,179
damage they can do we can not feed the

00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,709
trolls all those things this is still a

00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:08,589
good it's a little bit long but it's

00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:13,480
still a good talk by Brian Fitzpatrick

00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:15,069
and I can't remember his name how open

00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,299
source projects survived poisonous

00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:19,569
people

00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:20,709
but that is still a talk worth listening

00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:22,689
to for whether you're an Apache project

00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:24,429
or anywhere else where it's you know

00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:26,290
people people choosing to gather

00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:29,069
together rather than a company where

00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,069
you're told what to do

00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:39,000
so we can't can't emphasize this one

00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:40,890
enough we have a code of conduct at the

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,500
ASF thank you to the CouchDB project

00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:46,430
with that originally drafted one in a

00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:49,020
very thoughtful way as a community

00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:50,880
focused on the behaviors not on the the

00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,890
people or the whatever so it's a good

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,690
thing it's not something we want to use

00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:56,460
it's not something we want to say this

00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:58,890
is a code of conduct violation it's

00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:03,030
something we we hope that communities

00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:06,180
can you know surface as an expected way

00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:10,710
that they communicate and that when you

00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:13,650
communicate remember to hold that in

00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:16,800
yourself even if someone else is not try

00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:20,610
to respond politely I know that's hard

00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:24,990
but and the other one is when someone is

00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:26,640
regularly abusing or coming or what you

00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:30,030
feel might be abusing but you're not

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,170
sure in a project community work with

00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,900
the rest of the project community to

00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:35,220
address it and ask the question whether

00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,990
that happens that's one of the few

00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,430
things that if if you're really not

00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:41,160
comfortable having it happen on the

00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:45,270
public development list ask a few people

00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:47,160
you know in private and the great

00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:49,320
majority of time even if you were

00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,720
worried about the feedback if you ask in

00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,490
private you'll find yes other people are

00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,830
exactly in the same situation you are

00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:56,850
they have exactly the same thought and

00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:00,450
they're like I just don't have the

00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:01,350
energy to call on this and once you find

00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,550
that there are three other people who

00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,670
are like I don't have the energy I'm

00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:08,790
like that's exactly what I thought then

00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:09,990
one of you can bring it up and you know

00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,990
there are people who are agreeing with

00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:15,000
you who are saying we need to be polite

00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:18,170
and respectful of everyone else and we

00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,940
need to focus on the project work not on

00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:22,940
whatever else in the world there is and

00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:32,190
language for communication this is not a

00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,140
slide I'm happy about in terms of what

00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:38,250
we do but I think this is the reality

00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:40,170
the at at Apache I mean the Apache way

00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:42,880
can the methods can be applied elsewhere

00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:45,850
but at Apache as we practice it

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:50,020
the ASF the core development activity in

00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:51,540
a project must be in English and at the

00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,820
current time there's no way around that

00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:56,710
and we've we've had a couple of real

00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,870
questions where we've had projects and

00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:03,220
other languages with primary developers

00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:06,820
there and we we can't bring them into

00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:10,960
incubation because translation software

00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:12,160
isn't social you can't just read a

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,410
mailing list and put it through Google

00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,840
Translate or Bing Translate and then

00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:19,570
expect to be able to evaluate what's

00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:23,620
happening and the most important thing

00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:25,120
for community is that the PMC can

00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,610
provide oversight to the community that

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,160
the PMC as a whole knows what's

00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:32,560
happening can give feedback on crazy

00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:36,190
ideas from creators can make a decision

00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,750
to make a release or wait can make a

00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:39,820
decision to add a new committer

00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:43,150
who's been adding a list who's been

00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:45,880
contributing code if the PMC as a whole

00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:47,920
can't understand the process by that

00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,530
which that work happens they can't make

00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,960
an informed decision and in particular

00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:55,770
the board needs to be able to provide

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,990
oversight for all of our projects so

00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:00,580
when we have a project report projects

00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,560
report quarterly to the board and the

00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:05,740
board reads all the reports you know or

00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,630
reading today later actually when the

00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,400
board when a director has a question

00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,600
about project report we will go into

00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,920
your lists we'll go into your private

00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,290
list and we'll review the past several

00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,460
months of traffic to see you know you

00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:18,460
said something kind of funding the

00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,690
report I want to see if you're going off

00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,300
the rails or if maybe there's a reason

00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:25,810
for it and if the board can't provide

00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:28,300
that oversight we can't operate and the

00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:30,100
board currently we all share English is

00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,510
a common language so in terms of

00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,250
development activity we can certainly

00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:35,170
support user lists answering questions

00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,720
for multiple languages and of course

00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:40,120
developing software that has language

00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,490
packs and so on is fine but the way the

00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:46,780
project moves its activity forward must

00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:48,580
be in English so that was communication

00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:51,250
communication this was kind of simple

00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,690
because that's sort of just working

00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,460
online and working an email and

00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,720
remembering everybody else's looking at

00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:00,600
a screen like this

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:04,049
so I've done the last two we've got the

00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:08,149
first three where to go next community

00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:11,299
okay well that's really obvious suppose

00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:11,299
there we go

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,710
well that's so that's a really good word

00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,390
community so we all have many

00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,760
communities it's like a gigantic Venn

00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:24,020
diagram of millions of overlapping

00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:28,289
circles so what do we mean by community

00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:31,020
so we don't live together most of us

00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:33,330
don't work together many of us don't

00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:35,220
know each other until we've met today hi

00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:39,120
I'm Shane by the way nice to meet you

00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:44,480
all glad to see you accept through our

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,480
project so this is a different

00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:49,230
open-source development is is in some

00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,240
ways a different human activity than

00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:54,360
virtually any other activity in human

00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,250
history and that we can all work

00:22:54,360 --> 00:23:01,590
constructively in a very very rich way

00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:03,870
on realistic tasks completely

00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:06,570
anonymously online from anywhere in the

00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:08,549
world at any time in the world and it's

00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:10,649
hard to remember that the project

00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:12,750
community all the members of it all have

00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:14,549
their own communities of communities and

00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:20,490
that we're coming together for this one

00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:22,140
software thing so it's through our

00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:24,149
projects that we know each other and

00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:26,490
that's the community when we're talking

00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:29,220
about in Apache Way community and that

00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:31,230
includes the developers writers for

00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:34,470
documentation testers sis admin's DevOps

00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:38,760
and users so the people who are not

00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:42,090
always obvious in an Apache community

00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,289
are the users who are using it and who

00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:45,929
might be frustrated but haven't gotten

00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:48,029
around yet to reporting a bug or who are

00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:51,740
going to try and sell their boss on

00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:54,809
using this for everything so those are

00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,760
great projects like some of the ones we

00:23:54,809 --> 00:24:01,399
have really engage users and make it

00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:05,130
easier for users to get help have forums

00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:06,899
you know have an ecosystem of developers

00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:08,250
or consultants who who can provide all

00:24:06,899 --> 00:24:08,909
the services to around the project

00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,369
separately

00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:13,710
but we need to think about that whole

00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:15,690
community and that's what the goal is to

00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:23,840
serve that whole community with the best

00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:26,549
software we can so yeah this comes back

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,249
but this is a different message than no

00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:32,700
jerks allowed earlier in that Apache

00:24:29,249 --> 00:24:33,450
communities value group contributors not

00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:37,229
lone wolves

00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:39,749
so Apache is different than a number of

00:24:37,229 --> 00:24:43,409
other foundations or common or popular

00:24:39,749 --> 00:24:46,700
open-source projects in that BDF ELLs

00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:49,590
benevolent dictators are not allowed

00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:52,759
where you will not accept projects who

00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:56,249
act that way and the board is here to

00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:58,529
backstop PMC's who you know if your PMC

00:24:56,249 --> 00:25:00,419
for some strange reason find somebody

00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:02,879
who looks like they're trying to crown

00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:06,389
themselves King the board will prevent

00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:08,580
that because that is not in our view a

00:25:06,389 --> 00:25:11,519
healthy long-lived community because it

00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,200
doesn't allow it doesn't make it

00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:14,700
welcoming for new contributors if you

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,720
perceive that this if you don't get

00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,799
along as one person you won't be

00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:21,599
accepted same way with companies if it's

00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:24,029
perceived that one company runs a

00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,950
project then why would other companies

00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:27,119
ever have their engineers contribute why

00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:29,309
would they consider using this because

00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:32,210
the other four company has a lock so

00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:37,739
that's why we need a diverse community

00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:39,419
and your primary goal for the really big

00:25:37,739 --> 00:25:42,919
picture is attract new contributors

00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:47,700
that's how you have a long live project

00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:55,409
so any immortal words of Bill and Ted be

00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:59,809
excellent to each other that's I don't

00:25:55,409 --> 00:26:03,179
know how to how to say it and it's it's

00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:06,029
it's being respectful of everyone else

00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:09,269
and it's also focusing on the work of

00:26:06,029 --> 00:26:12,210
the project so other discussions some

00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:15,029
projects have a social community too but

00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:16,979
that's not necessarily part of how we

00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:19,019
need to builds offer so the other

00:26:16,979 --> 00:26:20,549
question sometimes is keeping the

00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:22,720
discussions focused on what the project

00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:26,390
really needs

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:29,630
so for community we all wear different

00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:32,390
hats so for those who aren't aware hats

00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:36,260
are sort of the symbol for who you're

00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:39,080
speaking on behalf of are you Shane the

00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:42,020
you know Hawaiian shirt guy are you

00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:43,340
Shane the currently unemployed has

00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:47,750
husband and father

00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:53,840
um are you Dan who works for the company

00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:55,670
or are you a director of the ASF who is

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,890
telling a project they should be doing

00:26:55,670 --> 00:27:03,980
something what role are you taking when

00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:05,480
you are speaking or typing on a list so

00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,300
that's doubly important for any wouldn't

00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,430
anyone in a corporate setting because

00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:12,200
Apache does not recognize corporate

00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:13,400
contributions I mean we have a

00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,300
sponsorship program with money that's

00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:20,240
separate in terms of project act actions

00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:21,740
you are all you when you're coming to

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:26,270
the Apache list and contributing and we

00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:27,830
recognize you as an individual so for

00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:30,350
corporate teams which we have many of a

00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:32,930
side effect is that if your corporation

00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:35,000
wants to work on a project each of your

00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:37,610
individual engineers or managers or

00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,410
product development people we don't see

00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:41,240
them as a team apache sees them as a

00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:44,540
bunch of different people they each need

00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:48,040
to do their own work to gain merit which

00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:51,410
is one thing and a side effect is that

00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:53,240
your actions reflect on you throughout

00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:55,700
your personal career not just when

00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,170
you're at one company so it's important

00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,940
sometimes you do need to speak for your

00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:00,200
company you say my company has this

00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,180
really serious bug and we have other

00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,350
customers and we you know I'm going to

00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,200
work on this in the project and I hope

00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:09,140
I'll be still will okay but the rest of

00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:11,350
time we expect you to be speaking for

00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:14,570
the benefit of the project of the whole

00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:17,990
which is sort of cutting slide backwards

00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:23,750
perhaps check your affiliation at the

00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:25,670
door so when we make decisions at an

00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:27,380
Apache project there's there's not a

00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:29,690
hierarchy with it with our project it's

00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,950
not the chair of the PMC and then the

00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:35,120
senior members of the PMC and the rest

00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:37,100
of PMC and then tomaters it's the PMC

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,200
and its creators that's the decision

00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:41,810
level of the project and everyone has an

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,270
equal vote and every project has a

00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:48,980
completely separate way of doing things

00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:51,440
so the other aspect of this is that your

00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:52,970
fellow PMC members when you're when

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,430
you're interacting on the project list

00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:57,860
about the project we don't care what

00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:59,350
company you work for usually we don't

00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:03,680
care what role you have at your company

00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:08,540
so we actually have airline pilots and

00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:10,190
major financial company C CTOs and you

00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:12,620
know marketing directors who are

00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:14,630
committed on Apache projects that

00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,400
doesn't matter on the project what

00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:21,950
matters is how they act in the project

00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:24,170
space and what job they do there so the

00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:28,520
upshot of the hats and affiliation and

00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:30,230
having a flat PMC is that part of the

00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,990
Apache way it is required of all

00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:35,450
projects is that the project is governed

00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:40,070
independently of undue commercial

00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:43,940
influence the way that we enforce this

00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:48,920
is that the ASF owns all trademarks on

00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:52,280
behalf of the projects and the board of

00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:54,050
Apache will ensure that if a PMC goes

00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,660
off the rails or if some company tries

00:29:54,050 --> 00:30:00,920
to subvert a project the board can step

00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:02,480
in unilaterally and fix that now that is

00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,070
not a pretty sight and you don't want it

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,740
to happen but it rarely happens so

00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:07,280
hopefully we'll talk about it but your

00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,640
project

00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:12,320
you own your brand and your your how you

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:17,090
interact with the world and your code

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:20,690
and you own your own governance as long

00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:23,060
as you are independent as long as when

00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:25,310
new contributors to your project show up

00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:26,990
and do valuable work that they're

00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:30,770
recognized on their contributions and

00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:32,660
not on their corporate affiliation so

00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:34,160
there's some times where it's it's

00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,120
easier when you you know one of your

00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,710
teammates happens to be a new

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,640
contributor and it's all you you know

00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,080
them and you want to watch me just

00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,250
committer quickly because you you can

00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:44,060
explain all the good things about them

00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:45,980
the project hasn't seen that the project

00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:47,610
hasn't seen the things that you've seen

00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:50,880
as being a co-worker of theirs

00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:55,110
so that's one thing to look out for and

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:57,750
the other one is we're great committers

00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:59,760
from this consultancy and this other

00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:02,010
competitor of the major company in the

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,440
area put in a lot of work to the project

00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:08,250
but never get recognized by the PMC

00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:11,850
nobody in the PMC chooses to vote de

00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:14,190
minimis committers and it's it's rarely

00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:17,220
ever planned but there clearly have been

00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:19,800
cases where many of the PMC members who

00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:23,340
work for the dominant vendor simply

00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:25,020
choose not to recognize them and that is

00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,940
not good because that will then

00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:29,070
discourage anyone else from contributing

00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:33,270
and that is something the board of pays

00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:37,200
attention to it's not a hierarchy it's a

00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:39,210
community in the context of this project

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:43,020
community separate from your employers

00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:47,850
and the rest of the world so that's what

00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:50,580
I have on community so we have merit and

00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:52,680
open develop the next OB Development

00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:56,420
okay she's been paying attention wants

00:31:52,680 --> 00:32:00,300
to speed things up here open development

00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:02,910
so just one quick reminder when you're

00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:05,040
thinking this we all kind of know what

00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:07,320
open source is we can have an esoteric

00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:10,380
debate on the legality of the term

00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:13,140
perhaps we're talking about open

00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:16,640
development we're in the process of

00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:19,020
creating the software is explicitly open

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,320
it's also open source but that's the

00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:24,030
point here so yes we use veiling less

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,320
than patching and sometimes they're

00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:29,760
annoying but that's how we do it because

00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:33,270
mailing lists are asynchronous

00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,770
communication so we're a community about

00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:37,260
a project we're community in this room

00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:40,050
and we come from all around the world

00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:42,270
they come from day jobs that are 9:00 to

00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:46,200
5:00 we come from DevOps people who work

00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:47,640
on shift off shift we come from college

00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,430
students and people who are unemployed

00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:53,370
and do this is a hobby

00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:55,860
so ensuring that we don't make decisions

00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:57,570
today we're not going to decide a new

00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:00,390
aspect of the apache way here in the

00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:01,400
room we might talk about one but then we

00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:04,610
bring it back to the list

00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:07,760
and let the broader community think

00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:10,030
about it so when we only know each other

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,590
through the project we need to make sure

00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:19,220
everyone else has a chance to respond to

00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:21,260
our great new idea so archiving

00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,900
everything is another big thing in

00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:25,490
Apache if it didn't happen on the list

00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:29,410
then it didn't happen

00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:33,440
that's an old adage at the ASF we're in

00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:35,390
in the big picture if something wasn't

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,580
surfaced on a list then we don't

00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:41,270
consider it a proper action of the

00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:42,650
project because the board can't provide

00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:44,060
oversight though or your PMC can't

00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:48,320
provide oversight if what's up group for

00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:49,280
commuters newcomers to your list or new

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,920
corners to your project

00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,870
can't learn about what happened they

00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,070
can't suddenly a bunch of code shows up

00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:57,830
they don't know where it came from or

00:33:55,070 --> 00:34:01,900
why I never had a chance to participate

00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:01,900
in the development of that thing so the

00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:07,430
having everything in a public list in

00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:10,570
particular is important because that

00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:13,610
allows everyone else to okay there we go

00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:16,100
everyone else to see both today as it's

00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:18,680
happening and in the future when people

00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,760
can come back come by and say to

00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,410
themselves well I don't want to ask

00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,640
about the stupid question well if they

00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:26,810
look in the list archives they can see

00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:28,160
how you've got someplace so making sure

00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:31,340
that we have an archive of everything is

00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:32,600
important for bringing in newcomers and

00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,670
it's important for community members

00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:37,610
because we have arguments in a year from

00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:39,410
today about what happened and somebody

00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:41,180
will say oh here's what we decided on

00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:46,340
the list or you have a clear reference

00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:48,590
of what the group decided so a key part

00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:50,330
of this is both is motivations and

00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:54,920
decisions so we need to have transparent

00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:56,870
decision-making so we have our own

00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,510
motivations for being here I'm here

00:34:56,870 --> 00:35:00,710
because I love Apache some of you are

00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:02,960
here because you work for your lawyer

00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:04,700
and it's important to play with Apache

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,650
projects some of you are here because

00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:10,430
you work on five Apache projects and you

00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:13,850
want to learn all those motivations are

00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:15,180
invisible to the rest of us I mean even

00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:17,579
more so than when you're at work

00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:18,900
when you're an accompanying you and all

00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:21,119
your co-workers and your bosses you all

00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,819
understand the company direction we all

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,250
are completely separate individuals we

00:35:23,819 --> 00:35:27,809
only see the work through the project so

00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:30,569
it's doubly important to make sure that

00:35:27,809 --> 00:35:32,760
we Telegraph what we're thinking about

00:35:30,569 --> 00:35:34,589
for the project so I was just just

00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,960
talking yesterday and I want to figure

00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:38,730
out a better way to to write this list

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,279
really concise list that we can just

00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:44,250
post someplace the best way to work in

00:35:41,279 --> 00:35:47,520
an Apache project is Telegraph your

00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:49,109
intent I've got a great new idea maybe

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,210
if we switch from JSON diamo

00:35:49,109 --> 00:35:56,150
we could make it faster I don't know

00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:59,789
right put that on the list crazy idea

00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:01,380
then wait a little while throughout the

00:35:59,789 --> 00:36:03,990
design say hey here's how the API would

00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:08,130
work I'd use this parser put that on the

00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:10,380
list let people see the process because

00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:12,119
you're part of a community other people

00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,319
are going to have feedback sometimes

00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:14,010
other people are going to say oh I've

00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:18,900
already done that

00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:22,099
just copy this when you're working on

00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:24,660
your code check in early check it often

00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:28,020
submit work in chunks a bit okay here's

00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:30,029
the API level it's all the thing it's a

00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:32,130
basic test but there's no code in it

00:36:30,029 --> 00:36:34,650
okay now I'm going to code all the file

00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:37,890
modules so people can see oh here's how

00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:39,329
you're actually using format doing a

00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:43,380
giant code dump is not helpful because

00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:45,660
no one can review 50 code modules that

00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,829
are brand new as a code review which on

00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:51,059
projects do some projects don't that's

00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:52,829
fine doing each of those steps on the

00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:55,200
list gives the rest of the community

00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:59,880
time for feedback time for new ideas

00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:02,640
time to help you with your work so that

00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,109
is important for all Apache projects and

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,960
this is what we mean by open development

00:37:04,109 --> 00:37:11,099
that the process is done on the public

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:13,440
div list and I wasn't quite sure where

00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:14,700
to put the license but I think it kind

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,390
of falls under open development as

00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:21,380
Apache is pragmatic about licenses so we

00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:24,420
use the Apache License version 3.0

00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:27,780
that's that's

00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:29,270
period we have a very specific list of

00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:31,950
all their licenses that are allowed as

00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:33,600
subsidiary bits but everything that

00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:38,850
comes from Apache is under the Apache

00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:41,070
License the point of doing that which

00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:42,090
sometimes and we've you know every

00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:43,350
couple months we have a project saying

00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:45,300
oh we really want to use this library

00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:49,140
it's the best one out there but it's GPL

00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:51,300
or it's different no sorry I like but

00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:54,270
it's easier I'm like yes but it does not

00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:57,210
meet our goals as a foundation as the

00:37:54,270 --> 00:38:01,770
ASF as the Apache brand it does not meet

00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:04,500
our goals of maximum user freedom when

00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:07,830
we give out software we give it out for

00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,310
the public good and when push comes to

00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,900
shove

00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:12,590
that's a key way to decide things that

00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:16,110
Apache is doesn't help the public good

00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:18,780
so the the benefit of that is that

00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:22,800
people can then use our software any way

00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:24,420
they want and the real benefit is using

00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,850
the apache license on everything most

00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:30,540
makes makes it super easy to consume us

00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:32,970
anywhere and encourages the maximum

00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:35,010
inbound contributions that's what we

00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:37,590
want for a long with project is new

00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:39,990
contributors and this makes it easy

00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:43,790
anyone can contribute to us I suppose if

00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:45,960
you only use the GPL then you can't but

00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:47,460
we want anyone to contribute because

00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:54,150
then they can simply take the code back

00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:55,860
right share it and part of the reason

00:38:54,150 --> 00:39:00,170
that the foundation is important is that

00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:02,250
people have trust in the brand and the

00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:04,110
they they know what to expect from

00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:06,150
Apache projects because we always use

00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:09,300
this license we always provide the code

00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:10,950
we always do up a development even one

00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:15,030
of the things longevity of software

00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:16,170
projects we may not care about struts or

00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:17,430
wicked anymore because they're kind of

00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:19,620
old they're you know there's so many new

00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:21,410
JavaScript frameworks whatever people

00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:24,780
still run them people still want them

00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:27,030
right even if they serve as need for

00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:29,490
them even if the struts PMC goes away

00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:31,020
and we move the project to the Attic

00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:33,600
because they don't they can't actively

00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:35,850
see that oversee the project the ASF

00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,950
will always provide the complete history

00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:40,650
all the source code all

00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:43,349
the past releases all the development

00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:45,630
discussions all the lists as long as the

00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:47,400
SF is around so another key part of

00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:49,410
about Apache is that we will always be

00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,180
here and you compare that to some things

00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:52,680
on github

00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:56,430
who knows if some developer is going to

00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:57,720
disappear or in the left pad case if

00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:00,450
some developer is going to get annoyed

00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:05,430
and simply take their code away Apache

00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:08,520
will never take the code away and that

00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:10,829
is what I have for open decisions over

00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,839
development so and merit so we're gonna

00:40:10,829 --> 00:40:15,810
have to do merit quickly which is kind

00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:19,290
of funny actually because we are close

00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:25,609
to the end right think tennis okay so

00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:25,609
merit is about recognizing your work and

00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:31,859
some communities some people don't like

00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:33,900
Apache because they think meritocracy

00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:36,829
and then they think some sort of strange

00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:39,990
social construct that is inappropriate

00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:47,190
which is not what we really do is

00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:49,109
attaching so for us merit is really it's

00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:52,500
defined by the value that you as an

00:40:49,109 --> 00:40:55,530
individual bring to a specific project

00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:58,290
and it's defined in the context of that

00:40:55,530 --> 00:41:01,079
project by the rest of the project

00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:04,770
community so it doesn't matter if you're

00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:06,780
an architect or if you're you know a

00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:10,560
g-wiz developer and it doesn't matter if

00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:12,750
you're a suit that's not part of your

00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,579
merit it's it's and it doesn't matter

00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:16,920
what you talk about what you blog about

00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:18,180
what you've done in the past what you've

00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,670
done on other projects what matters is

00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:24,060
what you've done in this project

00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:26,640
community that defines your merit and

00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:30,329
it's defined by the peers of that

00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:33,300
community not by anyone else every

00:41:30,329 --> 00:41:35,310
project has their own merit structure so

00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,079
recognition in one project doesn't

00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:38,670
matter for other projects now obviously

00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:40,140
if you're if you're a long term Apache

00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:41,970
creator on some project and you want to

00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,980
work on another project they can see

00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:45,119
your history clearly right and they can

00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,680
see you

00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,900
you actually well with the project you

00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:50,819
fit in that helps but it doesn't give

00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,940
you merit to take chunk code changes and

00:41:50,819 --> 00:41:52,940
therefore

00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:58,989
a growth in merit is users and

00:41:57,489 --> 00:42:01,539
contributors who give us stuff we love

00:41:58,989 --> 00:42:03,849
them thank you you get voted in is a

00:42:01,539 --> 00:42:07,089
committer a committer means that for

00:42:03,849 --> 00:42:10,239
that project you get voted in by the pmc

00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:12,069
you have commit rights to that projects

00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:14,170
for posit or EES now they may have a

00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:18,640
commit than review or review then commit

00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:19,749
but you have write access that's the

00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,509
first important step the second

00:42:19,749 --> 00:42:26,979
important step is the pmc may elect you

00:42:22,509 --> 00:42:30,609
as a PMC member as a PMC member you can

00:42:26,979 --> 00:42:33,190
vote on releases and you can propose and

00:42:30,609 --> 00:42:38,019
vote on new computers or PMC members

00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:39,430
members excusing there's sort of another

00:42:38,019 --> 00:42:41,380
level of merit that's not really that

00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:44,259
important is a PMC chair or the vice

00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:46,960
president of the project they're not i

00:42:44,259 --> 00:42:48,940
made them not bold because they're

00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,849
really sort of a secretary they their

00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:55,210
job is to communicate between the pmc as

00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:57,700
a whole and the board and ensure that

00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:59,859
the board report is submitted but

00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:02,700
they're not meant to be a leader of the

00:42:59,859 --> 00:43:05,799
project everyone helps lead the project

00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:10,119
some people are elected to membership in

00:43:05,799 --> 00:43:12,089
the ASF as a corporation that's nice and

00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:15,460
it's a good honor big honor but it has

00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:17,259
nothing to do with projects really it's

00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,969
recognizing your work in many projects

00:43:17,259 --> 00:43:22,150
but it doesn't give you any abilities

00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:24,849
there and then we have directors who are

00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:27,670
elected by the membership to serve on

00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:32,319
the board of the corporation and that

00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:35,170
provides oversight for the PMC's so

00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:37,869
we're still part of a community that's

00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:40,539
very flat we're not a hierarchy so

00:43:37,869 --> 00:43:42,880
everyone with a commitment on your

00:43:40,539 --> 00:43:44,979
project has some say in the code on that

00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,039
project and can add their own new code

00:43:44,979 --> 00:43:50,769
to it everyone with pmc membership can

00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:54,039
vote on that projects issues so Mary is

00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:55,539
not Authority you can't say this is what

00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:58,119
we're going to do you still need some

00:43:55,539 --> 00:44:00,549
consensus but there it does get you

00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:02,529
privileges it lets you take actions in

00:44:00,549 --> 00:44:04,960
the project and it lets you have a

00:44:02,529 --> 00:44:10,630
binding vote or binding say

00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:13,450
in some things within a project so one

00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:16,599
problem area and I'm just but done is

00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:19,300
umbrella projects which I put in merit

00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:21,280
because we have several examples one is

00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:23,410
Jakarta which is long back in history

00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,579
Jakarta was an early project at the ASF

00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:27,099
that had a lot of different java

00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:29,380
technologies and then kept growing with

00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:31,569
it was great because you know Java was

00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:34,089
cool beans and it was going to you know

00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:37,960
run the world everywhere right once run

00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:40,030
well hopefully there were so many

00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,380
different components and modules and sub

00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:44,559
projects within Jakarta

00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:49,450
that the communities of people working

00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:51,910
on each of them diverged and that's a

00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:53,950
problem because the pmc needs to provide

00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:56,950
oversight and governance for the project

00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:59,950
so if the the TMC as a whole can

00:44:56,950 --> 00:45:02,170
evaluate is this project is this sub

00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:03,880
project this part acting appropriately

00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:06,520
there are there any great new committers

00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:08,319
is it time to make a release if the PM

00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,790
see as a whole can't evaluate each of

00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:12,010
the different bits of software they're

00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:14,950
making that's too big they're they're

00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:18,040
becoming a board above several projects

00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:21,579
and that's just it's not efficient it's

00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:23,260
it's also difficult to ensure that the

00:45:21,579 --> 00:45:24,910
apache way and the corporate

00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:28,180
responsibilities we have are being held

00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:29,530
to the same standard so that is why we

00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:33,809
tend not to have umbrella projects

00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:33,809
because each community needs to be

00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:39,609
focused on a set of tasks that in

00:45:36,849 --> 00:45:43,210
general the community members the TMC

00:45:39,609 --> 00:45:45,099
members and creators all can have some

00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:47,680
effect on or at least can evaluate the

00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:49,450
work of on going forward and that way

00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,250
they can provide feedback on on things

00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:52,720
and when projects get bigger than that

00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,559
we didn't we tend to simply say well you

00:45:52,720 --> 00:46:00,369
know why don't you split up into two

00:45:53,559 --> 00:46:01,930
projects no big deal and that is all

00:46:00,369 --> 00:46:04,030
right so if we take a different way we

00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:10,809
will come back to the lovely beach scene

00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:14,530
and we will go to questions so these

00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:18,160
slides are online I'll tweet them out

00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:20,250
again later and indeed the

00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:23,590
the whole of the Apache org website is

00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:25,870
online and is open to all traders of

00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:28,900
course only members can actually publish

00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:32,260
the top-level website but this is an

00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:35,200
area where we need you to help out so

00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:37,690
anytime that you are reading a piece of

00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:41,200
documentation on any Apache project that

00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:44,730
doesn't make sense please ask about it

00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:47,880
and if you can if you're going to answer

00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:50,740
submit a change for that documentation

00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:52,500
that's one thing I think sometimes we we

00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:55,390
fall back whether we're in a hurry or

00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:56,650
lever to simply asking a question

00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:59,190
somebody goes just answer like oh okay

00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:02,100
great and we go off and do our thing

00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:05,590
anytime that we can change that and say

00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:09,280
great here's the patch to add that FAQ

00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:11,500
or hey I know this step of the install

00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:14,830
instructions are wrong submit the patch

00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:16,690
that's just something that we some

00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:19,480
projects do a great job of a lot of

00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:22,780
projects not as much the foundation

00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:26,910
website itself I'm not going to say

00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:29,920
anything there and separately I have and

00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:33,100
the Apache Way website that I've written

00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:35,380
it's my perspective on all this kind of

00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:38,470
thing that goes into a lot of the

00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:42,070
history and rationale of all these

00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:47,550
behaviors so that also is open source

00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:50,620
and I'm happy to take pull requests so

00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:57,310
questions so we have with the end of the

00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:58,570
session okay ah yep so I'm happy for a

00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:00,340
quick question and I'm also going to be

00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:03,840
here for you know the rest of conference

00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:03,840
obviously so thank you

00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:09,959
