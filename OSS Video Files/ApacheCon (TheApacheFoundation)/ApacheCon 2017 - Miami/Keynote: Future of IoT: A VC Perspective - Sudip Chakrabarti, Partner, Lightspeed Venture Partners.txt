thank you so thank you all for coming

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,660
here to listen to me

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,730
my goal over the next 20 minutes is

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,349
going to be to make sure that is not the

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,929
least productive session for you at this

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:19,020
amazing conference so the Bark's that

00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,240
pretty live for myself let me just tell

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,859
you a little bit about my background I

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,320
think rich touched on a little bit of

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,420
that but I'm especially I'm an early

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,550
stage investor at a venture capital firm

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,630
called Lightspeed Venture Partners so we

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,590
are located in Menlo Park California

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,059
with offices in Israel India and China

00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,399
so I actually started my career as an

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:41,040
engineer and an entrepreneur when I was

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,200
still in school at Georgia Tech the

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,270
company was a spectacular flameout

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,160
complete failure but I learned a ton

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,960
about what not to do which I think

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,870
qualifies me as a venture investor quite

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,010
a bit I did start a second company after

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,170
that when I was in business school

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,320
that's going much better so I did learn

00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,020
a few lessons from my earlier gig but

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,600
then fast-forward a few years I joined

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,860
Anderson Horowitz at the partner where

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,350
you know you heard some of the companies

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,320
where I was involved in and then I moved

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:13,320
on about 18 months back as an investing

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,700
partner at Lightspeed so in the last 18

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,920
months or so I have invested in

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,860
companies like silver let's calm stream

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,020
Lear and then a security company call

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,750
XIV and another seed company we have in

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,180
network management space now a few words

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,060
about Lightspeed very quickly the firm

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,340
started about 17 years back and we

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,619
managed close to about 5 billion dollars

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,079
today our most recent fund raised last

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,460
year with a billion to fund that we are

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,430
just in the early stages of deploying

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,720
some of our recent some of our portfolio

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,479
companies that have been in the news

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,159
recently are companies like app dinamics

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,189
we were seriously investors Nutanix

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:53,220
cities investor snapchat we were seed

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:55,409
investors muse of cities be investors so

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,780
we actually have at least we claim to

00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,490
have deep expertise and experience in

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,710
building enterprise and consumer

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,810
technology companies so if any of you in

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:07,439
the audience is thinking of starting one

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:10,610
do look me up offline please now I was

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,370
asked to come here and share with you

00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,840
our perspective

00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,909
investor and my perspective as an

00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,549
investor in investing in the IOT space

00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:21,950
for the time we have today I'm going to

00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:23,900
talk about the areas within the IOT

00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,120
ecosystem where we are spending time as

00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,799
investors trying to identify you know

00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,549
the businesses and the teams we should

00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:33,950
partner with the only thing I would urge

00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:36,650
to you is that take this as one person's

00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,989
viewpoint share and nothing more so if

00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,180
you have if you have other areas that we

00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:43,040
we are not looking at and we should be

00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:47,090
you know I'd love to have that dialogue

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,530
place now as an investor whenever we are

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,890
looking at a space to find opportunities

00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:53,629
to invest in we first try to figure out

00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,400
if there are macro trends or driving

00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:58,220
forces that we should pay attention to

00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,230
so we are not super flies for any

00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,930
particular pieces because then you tend

00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,030
to miss outliers but what we do we tend

00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,590
to do is we keep this blueprint in our

00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,480
mind as we are filtering through

00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,859
business plans and teams and companies

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,900
in our day job

00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:14,480
in the IOT space here are the trends

00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:17,000
that we feel that we are seeing and I

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,609
will quickly walk you through so this

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,530
particular few ones I have there so

00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:23,419
first is the number of end points are

00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,310
increasing exponentially so I'm going to

00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:26,840
spare you the eye chart off to how the

00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,370
number of devices are moving up and to

00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,760
the right but I think you know we all

00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:34,160
can agree that it's really huge and then

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,769
you know if you talk to people like

00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,919
Gartner they estimate that by 2020 we

00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:42,199
should see 20 billion devices Cisco says

00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,849
it's going to be 50 billion I don't know

00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:46,340
who is right but I know that it's going

00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:47,690
to be pretty big the other thing is if

00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,849
you really look at consumer and

00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,459
enterprise applications of IOT sprawl it

00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:55,129
split 60 and 40 60 percent in consumers

00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:57,650
forty percent in enterprise now because

00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:59,329
of the increasing number of devices what

00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,980
what is naturally happening is the

00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:03,079
volume of data that these devices are

00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,599
collecting and sending back is also

00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:08,269
growing exponentially and this is even

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,069
getting worse because for every use case

00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:12,650
that you can imagine we are collecting

00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:15,049
more data and hopefully richer data as

00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:17,599
well the other thing that we are seeing

00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:18,979
happening quite a bit and I will talk

00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:21,229
about in a some of the projects that we

00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:23,000
are tracking later on is that the IOT

00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:24,650
devices endpoints are actually getting

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,330
smarter and they're of course getting

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,670
cheaper but they're actually getting

00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,830
some

00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:30,600
order to the point that you can now run

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,000
a stripped-down version of Linux or

00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,370
Android on the endpoints and actually

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,170
can run some lighter applications the

00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,670
other thing that's happening here is not

00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,650
only are they getting smarter for the

00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:43,170
price points are falling to the level

00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:45,600
and out of the derby that that's already

00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,550
happening where a lot of use cases are

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,290
actually finally making sense which

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,540
wasn't the case two three years back and

00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:54,150
the last point I'm going to make on the

00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,760
trend is use cases are evolving quite a

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,860
bit so while the majority of the use

00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,140
cases even today tend to be data

00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,050
collection for visibility control

00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:07,170
alerting things of that nature we have

00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,940
started to seeing see use cases where

00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:12,660
instead of just alerting a human being

00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:15,750
the IOT system is supposed to take an

00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:18,180
action automatically now this evolving

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,040
use case is having a profound impact on

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,420
the infrastructure stack infra chirality

00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,550
stack we're going to touch on some of

00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:26,280
those things but as a result of that

00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:28,800
real-time processing streaming

00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,930
technologies event-driven computing are

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,080
becoming really important when you think

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:36,240
about investing in IOT and IOT vendors

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,460
are already exploiting some of those to

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,550
create to skeeter to some of those use

00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,200
cases now I'm going to put up a very

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:46,050
simple framework in terms of how we

00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,640
think about the IOT ecosystem so we tend

00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,680
to think about the technologies and the

00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,050
businesses we see in the IOT in four

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,610
buckets so there is a build bucket which

00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,100
is where we group all the technologies

00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:58,230
that go behind creating the device

00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,750
building the device the hardware at the

00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:03,300
actual hardware then we have the manage

00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,100
bucket where we put all the technologies

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,140
that are required for connecting the

00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,510
networking then the managing the

00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:11,640
controlling securing all of that for IOT

00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:13,440
devices then we have the infrastructure

00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,750
bucket at the bottom which is where we

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,730
put all the infrastructure technologies

00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,490
you need to cater to the emerging use

00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,320
cases that I've been talking about I was

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,120
talking about just recently and then

00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,460
finally you have the Deaf category where

00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,370
we tend to think about all the developer

00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,930
resources that you need the past

00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,370
developer tools the open source projects

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,810
you need to kind of cater to the

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,890
developers who are going to build out

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,250
IOT applications

00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:40,249
so let's talk briefly about the

00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,289
technology in the bill

00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:43,999
Ecosystem so just to be clear I'm

00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:46,939
actually talking about real hardware the

00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:48,829
stuff that goes into the devices and you

00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:51,199
know we investors tend to be fairly

00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:53,029
allergic to anything that smells or

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,769
feels like hard work a lot of start

00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:58,219
issues we have when are competing with

00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:59,539
large hardware manufacturers but the

00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:01,939
question is like why am I even talking

00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:04,489
about that well you know as the devices

00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:06,499
are getting smarter guess what they need

00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:08,989
fancier brands i Eve in a better

00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:10,639
processors and custom processes not only

00:07:08,989 --> 00:07:12,799
they have to have custom functionality

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,229
they need to be cheap they need to be

00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:17,149
power efficient and you know when it

00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:19,249
comes to building custom devices that

00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:22,039
have embedded processors today arm is

00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:23,329
probably the only game in town probably

00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:26,029
and there are some other solutions as

00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:28,399
well but given that you're trying to

00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:31,129
build devices where the price points are

00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:34,429
in low to double-digit dollar arm is not

00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:35,839
the probably a great misfit there so you

00:07:34,429 --> 00:07:37,099
know there are some probably interesting

00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:40,069
products out there and one of them all

00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:41,929
call out is the risk 5 project out of UC

00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:44,779
Berkeley which is the open instruction

00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:47,149
set processor architecture and the way

00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:48,559
in our naive way we kind of almost think

00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:50,629
about it as a sort of an open-source

00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:52,849
version of arm where you could actually

00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:55,129
use the technology to go and build

00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:57,139
custom processors in a self-serve way

00:07:55,129 --> 00:08:00,769
where you can meet the price point you

00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:03,469
need to me to get to the market now as

00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:06,259
we move you know once we have the

00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:07,999
devices the next task is to hook them up

00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:10,189
and connect them to a centralized system

00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:13,129
running in the cloud could be public

00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:16,369
could be private and what I would argue

00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:19,549
is that at this point it feels like it's

00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:21,259
a relatively more mature ecosystem as

00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:23,299
there are a number of companies already

00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:25,519
targeting this particular aspect of the

00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:28,099
ecosystem and I use the word relatively

00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,509
because it feels far from being solved

00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:31,339
it's just that there are more companies

00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,439
and teams out there some are already

00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:37,069
shipping and to end systems consisting

00:08:33,439 --> 00:08:39,379
of sensors that talk to a gateway over

00:08:37,069 --> 00:08:42,949
ble or ZigBee the Gateway talks to a

00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:45,709
cloud back-end over Wi-Fi or cellular

00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:47,779
and the use cases they're handling is

00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:50,540
mostly around visibility analytics

00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:52,129
alerting running on the cloud and then

00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,270
some of the other approaches that we

00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:55,670
have seen is

00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:57,890
companies taking their software is

00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:59,920
mostly as DK's trying to partner with

00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:02,690
device manufacturers the device

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,910
manufacturers use those SDKs to embed in

00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,170
their devices and the startups build the

00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,470
breasts of the back end which is a

00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:12,649
gateway and the cloud back-end as well

00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:15,680
now in our view we tend to think that

00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:18,290
you know as devices get smarter and they

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,959
come built with network connections and

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:23,029
as some of the standardization happens

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,459
on the connection side the protocol side

00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:27,380
the opportunity for some of the startups

00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:31,070
might shrink in the long run just just

00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:32,450
in our view the opportunity the part of

00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,770
the ecosystem what we think there's a

00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,959
lot of opportunity and we are very

00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,060
bullish about is once you have these

00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:41,510
devices connected how do you manage them

00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:43,310
now managing is a loaded term so you

00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:45,950
know it for us it covers a bunch of

00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:48,050
things first is monitoring so once you

00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:50,750
have the IOT solution in place how do

00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:53,060
you know what's going wrong and what is

00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,399
going on a device might be offline

00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,779
because it is run of run out of power or

00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:00,470
it might be sending data in the wrong

00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:03,680
format now corollary to monitoring is

00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:04,790
debugging so as devices get smarter you

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,070
are running applications on the

00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:09,290
endpoints so there's a need now to debug

00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:11,110
when an application is not running

00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:14,120
properly on the endpoint

00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:16,130
now the question is like you know has

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,640
this problem not been solved already in

00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:20,990
the IT world yes but the scale at which

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,579
this problem has been solved for the IT

00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:24,560
world it's very different from the scale

00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:26,390
that you are going to see in the IOT

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,029
world which is like several orders of

00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:31,040
magnitude more devices and data volume

00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:34,160
so we definitely think there are a lot

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,600
of opportunities there the other area

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,149
that we are spending a lot of time in

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,550
this particular part of the ecosystem is

00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:43,130
security so if you look at traditional

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,260
IT security approaches they have been

00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:47,870
designed to secure hundreds of servers

00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,779
maybe low thousands of endpoints in a

00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:54,140
mobile phones tablets and laptops at

00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:56,630
best but the other point about the

00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:59,060
traditional IT techniques is the servers

00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:01,310
on the end point have powerful compute

00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:03,860
available so you can run agents on the

00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:05,660
endpoints to gather data to detect a

00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,920
security breach and once you detect it

00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,630
you can actually apply

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,070
I'm going to polish your enforcement

00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:14,300
policy to stop that breach none of that

00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,529
exists in an IOT world where your

00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,329
endpoints do not have such a

00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:18,860
sophisticated computer getting better

00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:20,990
it's far from there where you can run

00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:24,470
agents to collect and apply security

00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:27,680
policies so the approaches we are seeing

00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:29,420
in securing IOT devices is lot to do

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,540
with machine learning and kind of

00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:35,120
profiling the devices from observing how

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,800
they operate in a in a in ideal

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,839
condition and then trying to come up

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,060
with the policies automatically and then

00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:43,100
trying to secure those devices using

00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,660
those policies at the network level it's

00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,339
a very different at the coldly different

00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:49,670
class of technique than that we have

00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:51,920
seen in the past in the IT world now the

00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:54,019
final task within the management layer

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,720
where we think they're still in a lot of

00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:58,610
opportunities is the patch delivery so

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,110
you know those patches could be former

00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,670
upgrades could be where sub where it

00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:03,470
could be application in a different

00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,329
versions of the application but you need

00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,920
to deliver those to the endpoints over

00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:09,170
the network connection that could be

00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,149
passive or at times so how do you manage

00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:14,089
all of that how do you build a stack

00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:15,680
where you are not dependent on the

00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:17,269
network as much or at which you build

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,680
some fault currents in that and we are

00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,690
seeing some companies that are trying to

00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,519
solve that part of the problem now the

00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:26,089
bottom line that I'm trying to make here

00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:27,949
is techniques the problems exist today

00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:29,899
90 words but they are not going to

00:12:27,949 --> 00:12:31,790
translate very easily to the IOT world

00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:34,519
because of two things one is device

00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:36,230
count and all that is data volume so as

00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:38,540
a result we are seeing a lot of very

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:40,959
interesting ideas and themes going after

00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:47,420
this particular part of the ecosystem

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:49,750
now I'd have fundamental sorry at a

00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:53,300
fundamental level I strongly believe

00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:55,339
there are a lot of opportunities in the

00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,740
infrastructure IT stack that you need to

00:12:55,339 --> 00:13:00,529
build below all this monitoring or

00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,120
securing part of the ecosystem and you

00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,319
know that's the part where that's the

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,269
part of the ecosystem where we are

00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:07,279
probably spending the most time and

00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:09,110
we're probably most bullish about so we

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,350
strongly believe that the infrastructure

00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:13,790
we have today is not going to sustain in

00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:17,449
a world where you have billions of

00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:19,339
devices sending petabytes of data so I

00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:20,720
want to touch on a few different aspects

00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:22,819
or the few different needs

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,060
this infrastructure and in a way we are

00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:27,740
spending time so first it's real time so

00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:30,290
as more and more devices get connected

00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:32,779
the translates a lot of data that needs

00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:36,290
to be managed and analyzed continuously

00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:40,579
across large data sets so now these

00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:42,439
specific capabilities are new and out of

00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:43,939
out argue that you know they are very

00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:45,740
specific to the IOT use cases that are

00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:48,350
emerging today with all the autonomous

00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:50,240
cars and the in a key kind of use cases

00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:52,009
that we are seeing so we're seeing in a

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,360
lot of smart and entrepreneurs building

00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:55,279
the next generation of data processing

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,500
technologies that is moving away from

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,420
batch processing getting into real time

00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,160
and they're like bunch of you know open

00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,480
source projects out there we actually

00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,579
have invested behind couple of those

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,259
that are trying to go after that

00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:08,269
particular problem and trying to solve

00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:10,639
it with real-time data processing

00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:13,220
systems the second is even driven

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,069
infrastructure so in the traditional

00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,959
world we are used to sending our servers

00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:19,579
physical or virtual we are used to

00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:22,310
turning up those servers that cater to

00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:25,009
climb the clients can be mobile mobile

00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:27,139
app or a web app and you know the server

00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:29,329
you run the server pretty much non-stop

00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:32,120
you know trying to cater to the client

00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:34,819
request in an honestly world where you

00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,259
have billions of devices and not most of

00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:38,959
them are sending probably sports data

00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:41,480
you don't want to send the kind of

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,730
server infrastructure you normally would

00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,350
be cater to that kind of use cases

00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:48,259
because the cost is just unsustainable

00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:49,879
you cannot do that so people are turning

00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:51,139
the problem on its head and they are

00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:53,509
trying to going after the event driven

00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:55,519
paradigm where you only come up with the

00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:57,379
server-side application when there is a

00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,059
request from the device so we actually

00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:00,889
invested in a company called service

00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:03,139
comm which is based on this server list

00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:05,329
or event-driven paradigm where you only

00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:07,129
stand up a server service server-side

00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:10,279
application when there is a request from

00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:11,930
the device side the final piece here in

00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:13,670
terms of what you need from this

00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:16,670
next-generation infrastructure is edge

00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:19,309
computing so as both in a device count

00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:22,360
and data volume increase kind of

00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:25,850
imperative that the data processing

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:27,860
needs to move away from a central model

00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,899
to a more distributed model so more

00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,939
needs to happen on the edge because you

00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:33,470
don't want to send all the data back to

00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:34,250
the central

00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,620
whatever you are running your

00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,840
application so you know it saves time

00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,060
and money it's better deficiency and it

00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,460
prevents the needs to overwhelm your

00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:47,210
databases that are running centrally now

00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:48,770
you know as divisive i also devices are

00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:51,920
getting smarter the point I was making

00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:54,200
earlier you know that you know beyond

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,120
not overwhelming your central data

00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,860
processing system the other need is you

00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,560
can actually run applications and not

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,450
just analytics on the edge so it might

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,820
sound a bit like science fiction today

00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:08,900
but we strongly believe that in a few

00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:11,390
yourselves your data processing system

00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,670
will probably be not confined within a

00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:16,010
few servers in a light slice our data

00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,840
centers more more importantly it will be

00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,880
the distributed systems will be truly

00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,250
distributed some processing happening on

00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,170
the edge some in the Gateway some may be

00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,480
in a data center in a closet and then

00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:29,420
some that absolutely needs to happen in

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,550
the cloud will go to the plug but what

00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:34,220
now you know you might imagine if that

00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,320
happens you shows up a whole set of

00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,950
challenges how do you monitor how do you

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,660
deploy

00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,640
how do you do bugs how do you secure

00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,890
this truly distributed systems so you're

00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,650
spending a lot of time over there trying

00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,850
to you know sort through some really

00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:49,370
interesting companies we have seen

00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:52,370
lately the final point I would make here

00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:54,830
is giving to the developers so no matter

00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:57,050
what you do what you've built eventually

00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:58,430
you need to get developers adopt that

00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,230
framework so that they can build

00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:02,600
applications that can eventually cater

00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:05,330
to the use cases so open source is a big

00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,580
part of our focus as an as an investment

00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:09,770
firm obviously Apogee has done a great

00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:12,200
job there and then we are looking at a

00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,230
lot of dev tools a lot of paths kind of

00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,910
solutions that help developers build

00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:18,860
applications that go on and run on this

00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,390
new infrastructure and the new IOT

00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:25,490
systems that that are coming to the

00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:27,740
market now no talk on IOT can end

00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,540
without a cautionary note so as

00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,430
investors we have been looking at the

00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,880
IOT space for I would say four or five

00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,040
years now

00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,170
and every year it feels like the market

00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:39,020
is going to take off this year but it

00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:41,480
hasn't happened yet so the reason

00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:43,010
question is why was what has the market

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,050
on the front underperformed

00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:46,500
over the years the first problem is

00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:48,500
monetization

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,570
so we can talk about all the interesting

00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,100
infrastructure needs and all the

00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:55,410
different kinds of monitoring and

00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,720
securing solutions for IOT the problem

00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:00,450
is it's very difficult to charge a

00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,070
respectable amount of money to secure

00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,680
the monitor and end point which only

00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:06,210
costs a few dollars or even less and we

00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,100
didn't have that problem on the

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,630
traditional IT side because the servers

00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,970
and the mobile phones and tablets

00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,460
they cost several artists more magnitude

00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:17,000
more in the IT world that business model

00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:20,310
needs to evolve we are seeing some

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,650
initial work on that but it's far from

00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:24,330
to a point where we can say well in the

00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,710
disability that's going to create the

00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,960
next billion-dollar company in this

00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:30,780
stage that also brings me to the next

00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,360
point which is fragmented use cases if

00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:35,190
you look at the most of the IOT use

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,630
cases and specifically on the enterprise

00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,600
side which is where I spend more of my

00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:41,910
time use case with a fairly fragmented

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,800
of some of the bigger use cases like

00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,210
temperature monitoring things like that

00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,370
are probably a few hundred million

00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:50,280
dollar markets and most of the use cases

00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:52,140
are smaller than that so the question or

00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,970
the challenge is how do you build an IOT

00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,470
not only from a technology standpoint

00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,060
IOT system from a technology standpoint

00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:59,760
we're also going to business model

00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,560
standpoint that can cut across multiple

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,170
use cases so that you can capture a much

00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:07,260
wider market across all of those and

00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:09,600
then the other point I would make here

00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:12,360
is interoperability so I was actually

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,220
looking at a McKinsey study some time

00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,730
back and you know somebody mentioned

00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:20,040
that 40% of value from an IOT solution

00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:22,200
could be lost if we do not take care of

00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,610
interoperability and you know we might

00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,040
divide about the exact number but I

00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:28,320
truly believe that is the case that is

00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:31,020
going to be the case because unless we

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,880
have standards and open protocols a lot

00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:35,190
of the solutions will be custom

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,810
solutions and a lot of the a lot of the

00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,750
startups will struggle to break into

00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:42,660
this ecosystem so that needs to happen

00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:45,570
so in summary I would say in a summer

00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,550
and our kind of categories our invest

00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:50,310
our sentiment in this market as

00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:52,770
cautiously optimistic and there are two

00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:55,650
things that's happening in this market

00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:58,260
which makes us more optimistic than

00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:00,029
before the first is we are finally

00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,849
finally seeing emerge the emerge

00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:05,489
agents of real use cases with VL are

00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:07,049
wide so it's happening on the consumer

00:20:05,489 --> 00:20:08,369
side with autonomous cars and

00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:10,289
smartphones it's definitely happening

00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:12,479
probably happening more on the

00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:15,029
enterprise side with ot kind of use

00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:17,129
cases as well as in a smart energy and

00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:18,749
service management kind of use cases so

00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:21,210
the use cases are finally emerging where

00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:23,429
somebody is saying okay I have a budget

00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:25,710
if you can improve my efficiency or if

00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:28,590
you can you know help me diagnose my in

00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:31,200
a the failures much better than I could

00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:32,909
do before the second part second thing

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,309
that's happening is the underlying

00:20:32,909 --> 00:20:37,139
technology stack has matured a lot in

00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:38,339
the last five seven years because of all

00:20:37,139 --> 00:20:40,559
the stuff that's happening on the Big

00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:42,179
Data side so techniques such as machine

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,279
learning streaming and all the big data

00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:45,929
processing we have seen finally mature

00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:48,389
enough or they can cater to those use

00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:51,179
cases the convergence of those two

00:20:48,389 --> 00:20:53,309
trends make us very optimistic than we

00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:56,159
were probably two three years back still

00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:57,989
very early in an awfully large market so

00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,669
at light speed we continue to be super

00:20:57,989 --> 00:21:02,909
bullish about this way spending a lot of

00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:04,169
time here so any of you planning to

00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:06,359
build a billion-dollar company in the

00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:09,320
space do look me up thank you thank you

00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:09,320
