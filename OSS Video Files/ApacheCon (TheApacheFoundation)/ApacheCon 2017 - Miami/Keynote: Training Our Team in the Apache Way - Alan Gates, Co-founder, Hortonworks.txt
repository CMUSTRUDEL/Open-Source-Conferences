	Keynote: Training Our Team in the Apache Way - Alan Gates, Co-founder, Hortonworks

Hortonworks contributes to a number of Apache projects.  When we started we depended on our many experienced Apache community members to train their fellow Hortonworkers in the Apache Way.  However, as we grew we found that training "by osmosis" was no longer sufficient.  So we have instituted training for our teams in what Apache is, how it works, their responsibilities as part of Apache and how that meshes with their responsibilities as Hortonworkers, as well as a practical list of best practices and what to avoid. This talk will share some thoughts on the need for this training, give an overview of the content, talk about the results we have seen, and discuss how we are now working to role this out beyond engineering into the rest of the company.
