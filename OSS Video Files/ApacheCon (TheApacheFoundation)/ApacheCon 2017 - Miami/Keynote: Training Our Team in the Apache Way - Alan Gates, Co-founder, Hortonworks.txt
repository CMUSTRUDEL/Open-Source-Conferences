Description: 
	Keynote: Training Our Team in the Apache Way - Alan Gates, Co-founder, Hortonworks

Hortonworks contributes to a number of Apache projects.  When we started we depended on our many experienced Apache community members to train their fellow Hortonworkers in the Apache Way.  However, as we grew we found that training "by osmosis" was no longer sufficient.  So we have instituted training for our teams in what Apache is, how it works, their responsibilities as part of Apache and how that meshes with their responsibilities as Hortonworkers, as well as a practical list of best practices and what to avoid. This talk will share some thoughts on the need for this training, give an overview of the content, talk about the results we have seen, and discuss how we are now working to role this out beyond engineering into the rest of the company.

all right good morning thank you for for

00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:08,880
welcoming me here today

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,280
so as rich said I am involved in a pig

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,960
hive I've helped mentor a lot of Apache

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,139
projects but I'm really talking here

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,710
more as my role in as part of

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:22,199
Hortonworks

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:24,539
today so for the those of you don't know

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,320
at Hortonworks we contribute to a number

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:30,000
of Apache projects we have I've actually

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,300
lost count four or five product lines

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,070
now several of which are based around

00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:37,290
Apache Hadoop and Friends in its

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,770
ecosystem but also some based around

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:44,309
other Apache technologies such as Kafka

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:46,850
Metron and others and I'm sure I forgot

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:50,340
some on this slide but the point is

00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:52,110
contributing to Apache and supporting

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:57,539
Apache projects is core to our business

00:00:52,110 --> 00:01:01,489
it's what we do every day so we started

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:05,040
almost six years ago now with 25 people

00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:06,689
all those people knew Apache most of it

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,729
everybody in engineering was already a

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:12,030
contributor to Apache I believe we were

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:15,360
already all committers even today we are

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,729
a worldwide organization of over eleven

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,640
hundred and fifty people we've grown

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:23,340
very very quickly now

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:28,110
what works at twenty five doesn't work

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:30,900
at over a thousand right so early on as

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,130
I said all our employees even people who

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,409
aren't in engineering understood Apache

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:38,820
and the Apache way and for those who

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:40,470
didn't we could do that by osmosis right

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,770
that's why I picked the Luke and obi-wan

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:46,409
here it was kind of the old gray beards

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,360
I guess giving the amazed new people the

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:52,170
technology but it was pretty easy to

00:01:48,360 --> 00:02:02,790
pass on when you have a critical mass

00:01:52,170 --> 00:02:07,070
there but what works at 25 doesn't work

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:13,650
at 11:50 you have to start to switch

00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:15,450
your your thinking as you grow and how

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,370
did we know this I mean part of it's

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,990
just when you say it out right it's

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,510
obvious right well it works at 25

00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:24,360
doesn't work at 1,100 but but what did

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:26,670
we see we started to see some mistakes

00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,740
internally cause people do some things

00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,720
they weren't supposed to do and just to

00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,370
be open about it we saw some other

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,100
companies make some mistakes where we're

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:38,160
like we don't want that to be us right

00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,780
we don't want to do that so how do we go

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,490
about preventing now what do we do we

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,530
realized we needed to become more

00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:46,080
intentional so we switched from the you

00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,400
know obi-wan and Luke to the Dead Poets

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,530
Society here where we're going to

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,980
actually teach yeah sorry you have to be

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,900
like old like me to get many of my movie

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,459
references though I did shave this

00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:02,220
morning so we don't have the gray beard

00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:04,560
but the we decided that the best way to

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,110
take this on was to develop a curriculum

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,620
for our teams to go through so we

00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:13,019
developed a curriculum and I'll talk

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,970
about what's in there in a minute that

00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:17,310
we took all we took first all our

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:21,690
engineering team through we started with

00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:26,310
devs and QE then went on to Doc's

00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:29,299
product management support all the all

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:32,250
those groups and ran them through this

00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:34,650
it's really about 45 minutes of content

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,750
and we leave lots of time for discussion

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,959
and questions and we do it in smaller

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:42,090
groups of we targeted 20 people or less

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,030
so that people feel comfortable asking

00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,850
questions bringing up issues we wanted

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:50,850
people to be feel free to say hey I'm

00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:53,190
seeing something else in my group or hey

00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,560
what about this right and that those

00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,750
small groups encourage that we also

00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,400
added a scope down version of what we

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,170
call our boot camp when we hire new

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,100
employees we put them through a an

00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:07,470
entire day of training for Hortonworks

00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:09,090
we put together a scaled-down version of

00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,410
this into our boot camp so that all of

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:13,109
our employees even people who aren't

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:15,090
maybe touching Apache on a regular basis

00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:15,780
at least have some understanding of what

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,030
Apache

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,820
is why we choose to work with it and and

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:22,109
all that kind of stuff and also we have

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,900
an ongoing cooperation with our

00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:26,340
marketing PR and conferences groups to

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,840
help them review their material because

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,050
they don't always know what they can and

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,730
can't say those are you know the kind of

00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:37,350
the forward face of our company often

00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:39,540
and we we want them to to make sure

00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,889
they're in sync with Apache and how it's

00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,570
working we want to make sure we don't

00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:46,230
end up saying things like Hortonworks to

00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:47,700
do or something like that right and so

00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,040
that's something where we work with our

00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:56,010
marketing team to help them go over

00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:59,220
their material so what exactly is in

00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:01,320
this training what do we put in there we

00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,210
started out with just really basic stuff

00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,850
what you know the structure of hacci

00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:08,160
what roles do people play there and one

00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:10,080
thing we stress in this roles and that I

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,460
would encourage you to take back maybe

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,060
to your companies if this is applicable

00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:18,000
is don't have to be a coder to play a

00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:21,120
part of Apache there are many things

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,650
that Apache needs right we need people

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,020
that write tests we need people that

00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:30,979
help others on the list we need people

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:34,710
that want to do you know legal things or

00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:36,390
all those sorts of things can play a

00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,490
role at Apache and that's something that

00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:42,200
we put in our training we do talk

00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:45,750
through the Apache way openness

00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:48,150
collaboration meritocracy no corporate

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,010
affiliations all those things that you

00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:52,020
all know from being part of Apache we go

00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,700
through that we talked to the apache

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,560
license particularly for our engineers

00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,060
helped them understand how that plays

00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,640
with their code and help them understand

00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,760
if you're bringing in code from another

00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:05,789
source what do you have to be aware of

00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,190
what does that mean all those sorts of

00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:09,900
things we spend time on widest

00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:13,979
Hortonworks choose to work with apache

00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:16,979
we of course have choices we could now

00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:18,300
some of that's obviously historical many

00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:20,039
of the projects we contribute to our

00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,020
already apache projects but we have also

00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:25,020
helped initiate a number of apache

00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:27,630
projects when other people come to us

00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,880
and say you know i want to do open

00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,620
source we

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,540
often not always because sometimes it's

00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,040
not a good fit but often we recommend

00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,460
you should look at Apache why do we do

00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,100
that

00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,840
so we talked through that we talked

00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,160
through what it's like to be both a

00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,690
heart and worker and a part of Apache

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,860
how do you balance that and obviously I

00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,680
can't go into all that here because I

00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:51,530
don't have time but to sum up we try to

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,940
show that 99% of the time our interests

00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:56,480
align because Hortonworks

00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:59,150
is so invested in Apache in the projects

00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,920
we strive to minimize times that you

00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:03,110
have to go okay which you know how do I

00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,730
resolve this we give people a lot of

00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,120
practical tips what have we found that

00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,430
works

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,400
what are mistakes we've seen that we

00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:12,290
want to avoid you know things we would

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,670
rather not see again and then we talk

00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:17,420
through trademarks how do we make sure

00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:23,240
and respect Apaches trademarks what it

00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:26,570
was that mean what do we need to do so

00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,760
we started this last fall we have now

00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:33,020
run the almost the entire engineering

00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:34,400
team through it all the support team the

00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,460
feedback has been pretty much

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,550
universally positive kind of some of the

00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,900
most common comments we got were you

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,340
know I knew a bunch of this stuff but I

00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,960
didn't know how it all fit together

00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,450
I knew the random facts but I didn't

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,690
understand the structure kind of so that

00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:52,280
was good one of the most common things

00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:56,090
we actually got were from people who

00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:58,190
were not writing Java code day-to-day

00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:00,170
they were very glad to hear they could

00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,270
have a place at Apache to that it wasn't

00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,830
just for coders it's something that the

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:06,470
least internally we hadn't done a good

00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,210
job making clear to people and it's kind

00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,590
of something we learned that we need to

00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,090
get it better at is how do we include

00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,610
all those other people and make sure

00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:15,530
they can have a place here too and then

00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,300
interestingly enough one of those common

00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,910
things I got is can you do this for my

00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:23,720
group too we actually just started with

00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:26,720
dev and QE and I think I put in product

00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:29,930
management I wrote them in the docs team

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,430
the UI team the support team all came

00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:34,099
and said can you please do this for my

00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:36,620
group as well and were then glad when we

00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:38,360
did it so it there you know it was more

00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,210
popular than I actually expected it to

00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,710
be I honestly kind of expected this to

00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:44,030
be treated the way people treat a lot

00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,050
training you have to do in a corporate

00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,400
environment where you're just like

00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,430
really I have to sit through yet another

00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:52,220
training and there I mean there was some

00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:58,160
of that but by and large the feedback

00:08:52,220 --> 00:09:01,400
was very positive that would be clear

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,220
this is this is a journey right it's a

00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:08,960
it's not one step it's not like okay we

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:10,370
did this we're done good away as new

00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,900
engineers come in we're going to need to

00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,610
continue training as I already said we

00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,990
put this in our boot camp so everybody's

00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,150
going to get at least some background

00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,530
but even for people who've already been

00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,910
through the training what's the next

00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:23,930
step for them what do we need to do for

00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:25,760
them one thing that became clear as we

00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,230
went through this is we need to be able

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,230
to answer people's questions going

00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:32,270
forward so part of that is simple

00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:35,120
putting together an FAQ a lot of which I

00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:38,390
well I haven't done this yet so it's on

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,650
the to-do list but a lot of it I think

00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,450
we'll be just pointers to the

00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,980
appropriate Apache documentation right I

00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,390
have a question about trademarks well

00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,820
there's this page on that I have a

00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:48,470
question about licenses and is this

00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,030
license okay well there's a page for

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,040
that but of course some of it will be

00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:54,860
questions internal to Hortonworks that

00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:57,800
we need to have answers for there and

00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:59,240
then a suggestion that was made to me

00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,800
that again I haven't implemented yet but

00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,600
I like it I think I will implement it is

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,030
building an internal mailing list that

00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,310
the Apache members that work at

00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:09,710
Hortonworks are subscribed to and where

00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:12,410
people can ask questions and say hey I

00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:14,570
don't understand is this okay or you

00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:17,560
know I just I have this question about

00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:19,340
this or that or the other thing and

00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,960
sometimes the answers to those questions

00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,460
are going to be that's a good question

00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,020
to ask on an Apache list that's a good

00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,300
public question sometimes those are

00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:28,580
going to be internal things that we we

00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:35,570
need to hash out first and that's a good

00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:39,170
place for us to do it right now in a

00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:42,160
good open-source spirit we are I've

00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:44,720
uploaded these slides on my SlideShare

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,100
well a scrubbed version some of them

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,900
some of the things we're adding work

00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,750
specific but I've scrubbed out that

00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:53,600
stuff put it up there I warned you that

00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,070
you know version one I haven't yet

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,150
worked through to get version two I'm

00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,330
going to do that

00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:01,460
sometime soon because having given this

00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:04,550
training more times than I care to

00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:07,250
remember now I learned a few things I

00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:08,870
need to clean up the slides you will

00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,700
need if you want to use them you're more

00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,800
than welcome to use them you will need

00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,120
to adapt them there's a lot of stuff in

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,100
there that's specific to the way we

00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,630
think about it like you know answers to

00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,080
the question of why does Hortonworks

00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:23,210
choose Apache obviously for you or your

00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,120
company that you may have a different

00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:27,589
answer than we have to that question but

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,970
please feel free to take those and use

00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:34,520
them as a starting point we're also

00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:36,410
working with our the community

00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:39,589
development team inside Hortonworks to

00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:41,480
do a meet-up of the with me doing this

00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:44,240
training and then do a youtube recording

00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,740
so that others could watch it as well at

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,360
first I was like really seriously you

00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,740
think anybody will care and then

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,000
somebody said well if you do this you

00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,200
can quit giving the training because we

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,100
can just show the recording I'm like

00:11:51,200 --> 00:12:01,220
alright I'm on board

00:11:52,100 --> 00:12:03,770
done so that you know I encourage you to

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,990
if if you find this useful or helpful to

00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:09,980
to take this in and start working with

00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:11,600
it as well now if you're interested in

00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:14,029
this I want to give a call out to

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,339
there's a whole track tomorrow in Apache

00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:17,990
con on the Apache wave where people will

00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:22,040
be talking about some of these things as

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:23,959
well as some other interesting parts of

00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:27,140
the Apache way much more in depth

00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:28,520
there's a couple tracks and our couple

00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,230
talks in that track that I saw that

00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,270
we're focused on how do i balance being

00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:35,270
a hard worker and a member of a company

00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:37,640
and what's it mean to for a company to

00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:43,040
work with Apache encourage you to take a

00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:46,070
look at those for a good source of yet

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,130
more information on this and I too was

00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:55,850
fast so thank you very much

00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:55,850
