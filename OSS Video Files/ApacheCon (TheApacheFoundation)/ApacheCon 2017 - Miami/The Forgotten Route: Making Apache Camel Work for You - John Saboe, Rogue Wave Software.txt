	The Forgotten Route: Making Apache Camel Work for You - John Saboe, Rogue Wave Software

Apache Camel is eight years old, and some say it's effectiveness as the glue between components has diminished. John Saboe says, "Not so!"

This is a classic example of older technology not being used to its fullest, which John proves by walking through little known configuration and optimization tricks that get data flowing reliably and efficiently - even for today's complexity and scale. This session covers:
Camel basics, understanding Exchanges, Routes, and how to implement EIPs with them
Examples of real implementations of common EIPs like Content Based Routers and Recipient Lists
Integration of Camel with common endpoints, like JMS, FTP, and HTTP
