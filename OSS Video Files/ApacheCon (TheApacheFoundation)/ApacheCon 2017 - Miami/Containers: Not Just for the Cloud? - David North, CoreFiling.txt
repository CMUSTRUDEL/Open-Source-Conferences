	Containers: Not Just for the Cloud? - David North, CoreFiling

Taking a containerized application and deploying it to the cloud is getting easier every day: the big cloud providers all have an answer, and it's the natural environment for Docker et al. But what about those of us whose customers still want applications on-premises instead of in the cloud?

In this talk, David North will summarize his real-world experience in deploying containerized applications on-premises, including in environments with no access to the public internet.
