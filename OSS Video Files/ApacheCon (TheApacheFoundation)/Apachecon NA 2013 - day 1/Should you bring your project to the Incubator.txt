morning everyone welcome to the first

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:09,559
section session of the overture and

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:12,269
beginners track first up we have Brendan

00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:15,509
megales who's going to talk about should

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:17,970
i bring my project to the Apache

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:29,760
Incubator and he is the chair of the

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:33,450
incubator pmc well well good morning

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,550
everyone this talk was born from a

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,860
hypothesis that some people coming to

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,070
the Apache con might be people who are

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,260
participants in open source software

00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,879
outside of Apache or participants in

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,800
some sort of commercial enterprise that

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,510
produces something that they're thinking

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,940
of perhaps moving into open source at

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,190
Apache and might find it informative to

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,930
learn something about what are the

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,820
conditions under which it makes sense to

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:01,250
bring a project to Apache and what on

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:04,320
earth happens to you once you tribe so

00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,850
just to give people a preview in a very

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,640
brief sense of what this talk is going

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,110
to discuss I have a kind of it's not big

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,630
enough to be a table of contents so I

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,070
made it an ottoman of contents we're

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,340
going to I'm going to spend the first

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,900
chunk of time talking about what belongs

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,670
at Apache now in some sense this

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,020
produces an odd situation which is you

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,060
could answer the same question perhaps

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,770
with less snark by listening to Nick

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,409
birches talk in the other track on

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,990
community / code or community and code

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,189
talking about the Apache way but here

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:36,240
you are and you'll get it for me with

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:39,180
sarcasm once I've given some explanation

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,890
of what sorts of projects make sense and

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,720
perhaps more importantly don't make

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:46,020
sense as projects to bring to the Apache

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,759
Incubator then I will proceed to talk to

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,860
give a bit of an overview of what is the

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,659
incubator how does it work what happens

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,030
to you if you come there but i want to

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,170
emphasize even before i start that no

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,920
one should think they're going to take a

00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,659
test on this there's a copious quantity

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,340
of documentation about the incubator and

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,560
of course a mailing list full of people

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,119
all ready to give you misleading answers

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,700
to your questions about what's going on

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,200
and so you don't have to feel like you

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,080
need to learn this for me but this will

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,880
give you a flavor so

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,920
should you bring a project to the Apache

00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,390
Incubator well really if you're asking

00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,520
should you bring a project to the Apache

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,250
Incubator you're asking should you bring

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,930
a project to Apache what are the

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,660
characteristics of projects that make

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:30,000
them likely to be happy and successful

00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,470
as open source projects at Apache and on

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,150
the other hand what are the

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,700
characteristics of projects which would

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:39,470
make them relatively unlikely or in fact

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,640
likely to be unhappy or unsuccessful so

00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:45,060
let's start with the negative of course

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:47,340
ok so I titled this talk should i bring

00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,620
my project to the Apache Incubator that

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,650
was a trap ok that's a trick that was

00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,600
there to fool you if you are the proud

00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,490
owner of a piece of open source that you

00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,040
have been lovingly and carefully

00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:04,530
curating and controlling every bit

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:07,310
twiddle and you know and and supervising

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:10,200
every capitalization of every comment

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:12,360
you probably need to think long and hard

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,010
or perhaps consider medication before

00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,950
you try to bring that project to Apache

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:19,050
because if one of the particular

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:22,080
specimens that Apache is very interested

00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:25,260
in avoiding is a species called the

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,239
benevolent dictator for life now you can

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,650
go on YouTube and you can find a number

00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,959
of talks about people talking about

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,459
styles of open-source projects and as a

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,709
kind of recurring theme here I'm not

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:37,410
here to tell you that the neville and

00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:39,630
dictator for life projects are evil but

00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:44,910
they sure don't belong at apache an

00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:47,459
Apache project is contrariwise a project

00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:50,780
that is a community it's not just a code

00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:53,250
base with one or even a small

00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,260
self-selected group of people acting as

00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,260
gatekeepers and sentinels and you know

00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:01,560
and and very carefully selecting who and

00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,660
what comes in and out it's a large

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,610
enough grits an open group of people it

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,709
adds people all the time it loses people

00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,750
from time to time those people somehow

00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:11,160
or another learn to rub along wherever

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,870
they are and whatever their particular

00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,910
personalities or organizational

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,590
affiliations are to make collective

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,590
decisions more or less by consensus

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:21,330
about what's going to happen what code

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,740
changes are acceptable what code changes

00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:25,470
are not acceptable who's going to join

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,520
the community are we going to capitalize

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,259
all the variable names

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,900
whatever it is it's a community decision

00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:34,199
it is not the Fiat of some one person or

00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,819
small group of people in charge now this

00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,860
means that for your project to succeed

00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:39,240
it will eventually have to grow to have

00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,699
a viable community there's a kind of

00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,830
minimum definition absolute rock bottom

00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:46,830
minimum definition of viable which is

00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,300
three really that's just eating along

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,919
you cannot have to do with voting

00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,530
procedure you can't have less than three

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,199
you're looking to build a community of

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:56,699
people oh you know roughly speaking

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,470
you're a happy project if you're

00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:00,539
starting out with about a dozen you know

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,819
it within your first year or so and that

00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:04,470
means finding these people and so if

00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:05,699
you're one person or two people or three

00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,900
people and you have some code and you

00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,849
bring it to a patchy it's a great idea

00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,789
that's wonderful but you won't be a

00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:14,220
successful Apache project unless you

00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:16,889
manage to you know act as a sticky

00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,449
object and pull in some number of

00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:21,360
additional participants they don't all

00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:23,669
have to be the chief hackers of the

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,830
Western world many projects have many

00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:28,289
important contributors who organize

00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,120
things right documentation keep track of

00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:31,560
business but there has to be a big

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,870
enough community or your project won't

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,219
be a successful Apache project and the

00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,360
other thing to note which sort of

00:05:35,219 --> 00:05:38,940
relates to some things in the keynote

00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,500
speech we just heard is that keeping all

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,690
these people happy and successful in the

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,250
community is going to involve making

00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,960
allowances for the fact that they're

00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,490
spread in many different places that

00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,990
they're in many different time zones

00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,240
that they have different ways of

00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,310
thinking about things and that you won't

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,599
always move as fast as you think you

00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,460
could move if there were three of you

00:05:54,599 --> 00:06:00,389
drinking a lot of coffee and Starbucks

00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:02,699
for an afternoon now what's another bad

00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:05,039
idea for a sort of an attitude to bring

00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:07,500
to an Apache project well the second you

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,120
know the second relatively unhelpful

00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,520
idea that I wanted to highlight about

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,860
bringing projects to Apache is the

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,569
sentiment in quotes in red on this slide

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,250
now interestingly enough when I sent

00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:20,940
these slides out for movie for review

00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:22,800
someone who is reviewing them for me his

00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,419
first reaction was what do you mean

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,889
corporations are evil corporations are

00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:28,080
finding Apache well in fact that's the

00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:31,080
point of this okay now there there are

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,270
open source communities that have goals

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,180
and even build whole licenses around

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,020
these goals which are relatively

00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,060
incompatible with corporate involvement

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,990
now different people will express

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,170
different opinion

00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,880
about whether particular licenses are

00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,040
more or less compatible with corporate

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,080
involvement but at the end of the day

00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,000
Apache is particularly an acutely

00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,520
friendly to corporate involvement so if

00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,920
you have qualms and squeamishness about

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,350
corporations if the idea that someone

00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,570
might make some money by incorporating

00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:03,090
your code into something they do gives

00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:05,640
you the heebie-jeebies or sends you off

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,890
to you know to in to put to put up a big

00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,450
sign that says no then please don't

00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,800
waste your time bringing that project to

00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,480
bringing your project to Apache you'll

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,120
only be miserable because it it's a

00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,950
principle of things that Apache that and

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,660
I'll explain more like the details in a

00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:22,320
moment that corporations are really just

00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,760
fine with us now how our corporations

00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,740
find with us they're kind of two sides

00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,320
of this coin we say corporation

00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:31,380
corporate involvement making money is

00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:34,860
not an evil thing at Apache but on the

00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:38,400
other hand Apache projects are not the

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,930
puppets of corporate influence so Apache

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,580
is also not a place to bring your

00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,110
project if what you are doing is running

00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,600
a company and you think it would be

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:48,330
great marketing buzz if your project

00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:51,150
have the Apache feather all over it and

00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:52,560
you could say oh yes we're Apache X but

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,240
meanwhile you're very carefully making

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,800
sure that the project consists only of

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,110
what you need and only of what you want

00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,580
and nothing that could possibly benefit

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,900
your competitors and you're going to

00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,400
work very hard to make sure that your

00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,800
competitors are kept at a safe distance

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,380
no we're not doing that here okay add

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,200
Apache while corporations use apache

00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:12,560
products corporations very frequently

00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,030
pay people to work on Apache projects

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,580
corporations do not control Apache

00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:19,140
projects all of us who work at apache on

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,720
the code projects as Jim said in the

00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:25,290
first talk today are operating as

00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:28,290
individual volunteers now let me stop

00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:30,000
for a second on that I kept to confess

00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,320
that the first time I heard this my head

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,480
almost exploded from cognitive

00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:36,780
dissonance how can it be simultaneously

00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:39,270
true that a person is a free will

00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,740
volunteer contributing code just for the

00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,900
fun of it when Apache project while

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,490
they're being paid for it somehow or

00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:47,400
another this seemed to go right up there

00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:49,320
with we believe it because it is absurd

00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:52,170
or whatever that famous Latin saying is

00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,910
from Christian theology well

00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,709
at Apache we have this concept called

00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,870
hats and I wish I had a funny slide for

00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:59,639
this but I don't but we expect people to

00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,620
understand what role they're playing on

00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,269
any given day if you're operating within

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,399
an Apache project if you're making a

00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:07,560
code contribution critiquing someone

00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,329
else's doing whatever you're doing we

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,699
expect you to be wearing your hat of

00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:14,070
your role as an individual Apache

00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:17,010
contributor doing your best for the

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:19,680
project and the larger community to for

00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,510
the mission of Apache your corporate hat

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,980
is a very nice hat it probably pays your

00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:28,649
rent but you're not wearing it while

00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:30,389
you're doing those things now I've sort

00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:32,430
of as typical gotten a little bit ahead

00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:34,889
of my slides so you know this is this

00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:36,449
short list of things you don't do as

00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:38,370
part of corporate involvement in Apache

00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:41,010
we don't have projects that are fronts

00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,630
for corporations another thing we do is

00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,190
defend trademarks and this will be an

00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,420
issue if you've got code and you're

00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,860
associated with a corporate environment

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,459
and you want to bring that code to

00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:52,290
Apache so Apache came to the conclusion

00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:54,360
the foundation came to the conclusion a

00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,880
few years ago that trademarks really

00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,070
were important that if it were if there

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,050
was a patchy Tomcat it was really a bad

00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,240
thing if people were running websites it

00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:06,120
said tomcat all over them that were

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,730
really selling malware that happened to

00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,680
incorporate apache apache tomcat or

00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,300
entirely selling services for apache

00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,709
tomcat and not acknowledging the

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,420
involvement of the foundation that the

00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:17,010
taught the trademarks are important so

00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,170
the foundation goes to a lot of trouble

00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:21,000
or to be exact the foundation makes its

00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,550
participants go to a lot of trouble to

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,940
hold and defend trademarks so if you've

00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:28,500
got some lovely body of code that you as

00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,269
a corporate entity you want to bring to

00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,709
a patchy one thing you have to be

00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:33,420
prepared to do when you bring it to a

00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:36,779
patch is to bring the trademarks with it

00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:39,029
or rename it either way but you can't

00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:41,040
have an Apache project operating under a

00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:43,110
name that can't be trademarked you can't

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,089
have an Apache project operating under a

00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,800
name that's a trademark held by someone

00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:50,339
else the product the trademarks have to

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,829
travel with the code and really as I

00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:55,170
said before the projects are operating

00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:56,699
as neutral turf now I would be lying to

00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:58,260
you if I told you that everything was

00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:00,630
sweetness and light and ponies and

00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,630
unicorns every day there are the the

00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:05,699
down sought one of the interesting

00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:07,980
stresses should i say of success

00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:09,899
seen it Apache projects is that once a

00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,399
lot of people have their livelihood

00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:13,529
depending on what's going on in an

00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,089
Apache project strangely they develop

00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:18,689
very strong opinions about what happens

00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:20,850
next and those opinions can lead to some

00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:23,489
pretty sticky moments in the communities

00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:25,529
where people have to sort out what's

00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:27,629
going to happen who's going to be the

00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:28,649
next PMC chair which way is the code

00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:30,419
going to go when are we going to have a

00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:33,179
release what's going to be in it and all

00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:34,949
those the hardest job almost next to

00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:37,619
actually building the community in the

00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:39,569
first place is keeping a community happy

00:11:37,619 --> 00:11:41,819
relatively speaking and successful and

00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:46,889
functional in spite of the stresses that

00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:48,600
success brings so the other side of this

00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:50,549
coin the good side of the coin is if

00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,769
you're a corporation you can bring a

00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:55,169
court you can bring code to Apache you

00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:56,879
can encourage your people to work to

00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:59,129
participate and contribute to Apache

00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:02,220
projects you can pay them to do that um

00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:04,199
and all in all as a corporation you can

00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,759
play nice you know nothing is more

00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:08,040
boring than reading the trademark

00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,169
mailing list at Apache and finding

00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,179
yourself faced with email from somebody

00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:14,009
from one company complaining bitterly

00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:15,629
bit somebody from another company is

00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:17,129
sent an email message that you know they

00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:19,679
think violates the trademark of an

00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:21,059
impact you know all this stuff I would

00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:22,499
use a different for letter I use a

00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:26,850
four-letter word if I wasn't trying to

00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:28,949
be nice okay you know ah no one's we're

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,779
all in this together we're sort of

00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:32,339
neutral turf a good attitude to bring to

00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:34,499
Apache in some ways is like the attitude

00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:36,689
that's occasionally been manifested at

00:12:34,499 --> 00:12:38,160
standards organizations where somehow or

00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:41,089
another everybody managed to check their

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:45,539
tomatoes at the door and get on with it

00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:47,489
now another way of introducing sort of

00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:50,579
what makes a suitable project for

00:12:47,489 --> 00:12:52,259
Apaches to talk a little bit from a kind

00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:54,569
of a particular sarcastic tone of view

00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:56,189
point of view about the infrastructure

00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:59,429
to pachi so Jim said you know isn't it

00:12:56,189 --> 00:13:01,470
great Jim Jim jiggle see the president

00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:02,939
who gave the the introductory talk today

00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,589
I keep forgetting that this thing will

00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:06,119
probably turn up on YouTube and people

00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:09,059
will be watching it who have no idea

00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:10,589
what happened 15 minutes ago he talked

00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:12,179
about how we have this all that we have

00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:13,589
these infrastructure contractors we have

00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:16,350
all this infrastructure it serves the

00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:18,089
projects well he also told you that

00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,139
relatively speaking the Apache

00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:22,589
foundation is lean

00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:24,359
it runs on a surprisingly small budget

00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:25,980
for what it does it tries to make those

00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:28,139
dollars go a long way and one of the

00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:31,019
ways it does that is by being something

00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:33,239
of the Ford Motor Company of project

00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:35,129
infrastructure for those of you who

00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:36,569
aren't quite as old as I am perhaps the

00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:38,910
expression you can have any color you

00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:42,299
like as long as it's black may or may

00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:46,319
not ring any bells now it's not really

00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:48,660
quite as bad as that but and but it is

00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:51,059
true that if you if you have a really

00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,470
ferocious attachment to some fundamental

00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:55,290
piece of infrastructure likes a

00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:56,609
particularly I've source control system

00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,040
which is not currently part of the

00:13:56,609 --> 00:14:01,169
Apache infrastructure then you're not

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,220
going to get a happy answer when you

00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:03,689
come and bring your code to the

00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,279
incubator you're not going to suddenly

00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:07,199
discover the people are going to lay

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,139
down in front of you and say yes indeed

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,939
we'll have that your curiel

00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:14,609
infrastructure setup review in a week no

00:14:11,939 --> 00:14:16,739
problem and even many smaller things

00:14:14,609 --> 00:14:18,239
than an entire copy of mercurial are not

00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:21,959
going to materialize just because you

00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:23,579
asked for them now the other side of the

00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:25,199
coin from this the positive side of the

00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:26,669
coin is there is in fact a fair amount

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,110
of infrastructure present at the

00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:30,869
foundation which is there for you to use

00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:33,689
as far as version control systems are

00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:37,379
you have your choice of subversion or

00:14:33,689 --> 00:14:39,239
get as far as bug tracking is going

00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:42,360
we've got a jeer instance in a bugzilla

00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:44,040
instance as far as somebody asked me to

00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,079
mention review board a commonly used

00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,329
device for helping people do code

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,799
reviews and there's a wide variety of

00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:52,589
other smaller bits and pieces available

00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:55,499
and if you have some particular item

00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:57,480
that is not too horribly challenging or

00:14:55,499 --> 00:14:59,459
for which you have a really good reason

00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,290
yes you can bring it to the

00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:04,499
infrastructure team and you can make

00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:06,480
your case and you might even there's

00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:08,129
support you might very likely get it

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,899
stood up but you will not get it set up

00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:11,399
in five minutes flat and you will not

00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:13,499
get stood up sort of just because you

00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,699
say so and one particular things warn

00:15:13,499 --> 00:15:17,039
you about is you won't get it stood up

00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:19,309
by saying oh but I'll do all the work

00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:23,069
the Foundation's infrastructure is

00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:24,299
considered a security issue if the

00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:26,429
Foundation's infrastructure is

00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:29,100
compromised bad things happen at the awe

00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:30,600
at the extreme it results in serious

00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,670
problems for people's confidence in the

00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,670
Apache products and so the

00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:40,170
contractors are for good reason very

00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:41,940
very averse to handing out karma as it

00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:44,340
were to administrative access privileges

00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:47,040
to systems at Apache so you can't really

00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:49,140
just sort of waltz in and say no problem

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,700
I need this it doesn't need much

00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,230
hardware footprint I'll take care of it

00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:55,590
just hand me the keys to a server and

00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:57,120
I'll take care of it and really save

00:15:55,590 --> 00:16:00,030
yourself some stress if you come to

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,100
Apache seek out advice before trying

00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:07,080
that trick okay it isn't going to be as

00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:09,570
simple as that now so that's the end of

00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,670
my first sort of large section which was

00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,780
what kind of projects come to a passion

00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,730
well I didn't leave myself an

00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,970
interstitial slide I'll talk a little

00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:20,250
bit about what that all summarizes so

00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:23,490
Apache projects are community groups

00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:25,170
they have to be a medium-sized handful

00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:28,350
of people to have any chance of function

00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:30,210
they are intended to be potentially

00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,680
geographically organizationally

00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,960
culturally and I don't know

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,420
attitudinally diverse in spite of

00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,530
whatever Java monocultural tendencies

00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,980
we've been diagnosed with in the

00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:44,010
previous talk and they operate within

00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,480
the Apache infrastructure and they you

00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,890
know are friendly to corporate

00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,050
involvement friendly to corporate

00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,850
contributions without being particularly

00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:53,990
friendly too overbearing corporate

00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:57,060
overbearing this so having said that

00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:58,770
what's an incubator anyway I mean we all

00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,600
know what an incubator is it's a thing

00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,920
for hatching eggs what on earth does

00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,530
this have to do with the problem well

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:08,250
the incubator came into existence at

00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:11,070
Apache to solve a gooch trapping problem

00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:13,410
of course we're computer people we think

00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:15,630
in those terms right where mommy mommy

00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:17,130
we're two New Apache projects come from

00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:20,370
right where are we going to get one from

00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:22,440
so I wasn't here for this but extensive

00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:24,600
rumor suggests to me and the occasional

00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:27,390
mailing list quotation from long ago

00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,730
that when the Apache foundation when the

00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:32,490
Apache group first contemplated the

00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:34,230
possibility that some other people might

00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,780
show up and look at what they were doing

00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:38,340
with the original HTTP demon and say we

00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,290
think we could do something like this

00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,180
maybe we could do something like this in

00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,320
Java maybe we could do something like

00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,990
this that solves a slightly different

00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,380
problem that they they set some people

00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,030
up and they

00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,200
turn them loose and honestly once or

00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,730
twice something completely horrible

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,850
happened okay there was a horrible

00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:56,370
meltdown in which they discovered that

00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:58,440
community values do not arise by being

00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,730
picked out of trees community values or

00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,560
something people have to learn not

00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:04,200
everybody has an idea in their head to

00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,850
begin with of how to operate as a

00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,920
community how to operate by consensus

00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:10,170
how to avoid some of the pitfalls I was

00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,930
talking about a moment ago so some years

00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:14,790
ago quite a while ago now the foundation

00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:17,580
launched the concept of an incubator as

00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:21,720
a bootstrapping device for helping

00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:23,370
projects get off the ground so one way I

00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,930
wanted to present the process was by

00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:27,150
presenting it in reverse and the reason

00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:29,130
I wanted to present it in reverse was to

00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:31,020
really emphasize the goal of the process

00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:34,080
you bring a project to the Apache

00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,100
Incubator to become a top-level project

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,170
of the apache software foundation

00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,790
there's some other outcomes that could

00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:40,470
happen i'll talk about eventually but

00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:43,650
that's what we're aiming for the whole

00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:45,660
incubator exists only as a way to get to

00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:48,150
help groups of people to get themselves

00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,680
into a situation where they can function

00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:52,500
as a top-level project reporting to the

00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,570
board everything else is just mechanism

00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,400
it's a means to an end it has no value

00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:59,010
except to the extent to the effect that

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,900
it supports that process so the end

00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:03,240
process therefore is being a top-level

00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,610
project how do you get to be a top-level

00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,410
project you get to be a palpable project

00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:08,790
if the board votes to establish you as a

00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,890
top-level project that's the legal

00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:14,190
structure when does the board vote to

00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:16,110
establish top-level projects well 99

00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:19,020
water we don't have had enough project

00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:21,450
to say 99 times out of 100 but in mutton

00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:23,250
current practice essentially the only

00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:25,620
way that a top-level project is

00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:28,590
established is if the incubator PMC

00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,670
votes to recommend to the Foundation

00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:32,580
board that they should establish a

00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,870
project so there's a vote of the other

00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,160
thing called the incubator of the

00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,570
incubator project committee I'll tell

00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,610
you what that is in a minute okay when

00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,810
does that happen that happens on the

00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,310
project demonstrates that it's been

00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:43,200
operating in a way that could be

00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:45,690
mistaken in a dark alley for an Apache

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,910
project okay that means it has a

00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:51,390
community it can build a community and

00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:52,860
it can build code so you might think

00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,640
that those two are obvious but as I'll

00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,750
discuss in a couple of slides maybe not

00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,100
okay how do you get to the point of

00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,240
demonstrating you can operate what you

00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,059
have to set up shop

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,470
simple enough and when what gives you

00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:06,330
the permission to set up shop while

00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:09,120
another vote of the incubator says yes

00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:11,520
we've seen a proposal we like this group

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,010
we think this group of people can is set

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,679
is ready to start we'll let them have

00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:18,270
the infrastructure and apache to have a

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,760
what's called a paddling a project

00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:22,170
supervised by the incubator and when

00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,179
does that happen when you're right a

00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:27,150
proposed so now reversing the order

00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:28,740
let's start with a proposal what's the

00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:30,660
proposal while the proposal is a

00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:33,900
document built from a template that says

00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:35,550
what do you want to do what's your

00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,830
mission going to be every Apache project

00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:40,500
has to have some moderately concrete

00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,970
mission up projects occasionally grow

00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,870
and change and mutate and even sometimes

00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:47,190
split and merge but you can't just say

00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:48,960
write software for the benefit of the

00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:50,130
public the foundation already owns that

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,100
one you have to be a little more

00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:56,460
specific um you have to make a specific

00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:58,140
mission like create a web services sweet

00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,580
conforming to very to certain well

00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,679
understood standards that's written in

00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:04,830
Java that might be a mission statement

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,570
more or less now then what are your

00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,940
initial conditions have you already got

00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:10,800
code very frequently incubator projects

00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,020
start because there's an existing body

00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,090
of code somewhere it's inside a company

00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,350
it's sitting on github it sits on

00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,780
sourceforge that you're going to bring

00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:20,400
who are going to be the initial

00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:21,720
participants generally the initial

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,429
participants are people who have had

00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,809
some involvement with the code to begin

00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:26,700
with if there is code though

00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:28,950
occasionally when codes being

00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,900
contributed by a company will see sort

00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:33,059
of a suspiciously long list of people

00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,380
who are employees of that company and we

00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:35,490
don't really ask a lot of questions

00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,770
about their Providence because their

00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:39,120
long term membership in the community

00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:41,640
will depend on their contributions to

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,140
the community and who are going to be

00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,640
your mentors i'll talk about mentors

00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,960
some more in a bit but mentors are

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,520
existing members of the apache

00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,580
foundation or at least of the apache

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:53,070
program of the incubator who are there

00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:55,140
to supervise what you're doing coach

00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:57,929
what you're doing make sure that the

00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,970
right things are happening um and the

00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:02,700
because of the whole question of

00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:06,210
companies seeing Apache as an attractive

00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,770
target for brand building the proposal

00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:09,960
template has a bunch of specific

00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:11,669
questions in it about corporate

00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,140
involvement from the particular point of

00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:14,070
view of making sure that we're sort of

00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,220
filtering out people

00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:21,620
registered transparently trying to build

00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:23,520
Potemkin villages at the foundation now

00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,770
under this section I thought it was

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,880
worth baking a brief summary of who all

00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:30,030
these people have been talking about

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,850
anyway um at the top of the governance

00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:34,380
tree is the board that's nine people

00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:37,650
elected by the members of the foundation

00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:39,210
I suppose oh I should have put it the

00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:40,320
very even above the board of the members

00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,270
themselves but this is not really to

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,830
talk for that the incubator project

00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,830
management committee is a committee of

00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:48,690
volunteers who's on the committee well

00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,460
the rules of the foundation are that any

00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:51,990
member of the foundation can be a member

00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,580
of the committee and then the committee

00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:55,200
sometimes elects other people who aren't

00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,630
members of the foundation who want to

00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,690
participate in its activities members of

00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:03,060
the ipmc like members of every other PMC

00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:05,640
at the apache foundation have binding

00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:08,880
votes on things like releases or commits

00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,130
to the code base which they you in the

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,970
eye PMC get used a lot for releases and

00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:17,490
hardly ever for votes on the code where

00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,780
the who else have we got here well I'll

00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:20,130
going to skip the shepherds and come

00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:23,100
back to the memo and who are the Mentors

00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:24,330
well we can't just you know somebody's

00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,590
got to be paying attention around here

00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:27,060
and somebody's got to tell you what to

00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:28,500
do if you're coming to the foundation

00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:31,110
yeah we have a bunch of things written

00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,240
down but it's never quite enough someone

00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:35,070
has to mediate between the people

00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,480
wandering in from the street and the

00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,800
Foundation's existing policies and

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,620
structures and help them to figure out

00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,570
how do we do this how do we hold a vote

00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,490
on a release how do we put the right

00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:46,500
headers in our source files what is the

00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:48,270
stuff that has to be on you know what

00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,950
has to be in a release anyway those are

00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:51,540
mentors of course your mentors are also

00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:54,360
accepting some responsibility for

00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:57,120
keeping track of what you're doing after

00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,800
all at the end of the day the PMC is

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,480
responsible for a number of things it's

00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,770
responsible for the fact that the code

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,840
that gets checked in to the source

00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:05,970
control system really is licensed to the

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,090
foundation it's responsible for the fact

00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:10,710
that the project is playing nice and

00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:12,060
having good community values if we

00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,740
already trusted you all to do all that

00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:15,690
perfectly we wouldn't be a paddling you

00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,280
just be a project so your mentors are

00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:20,940
the pr the people who are particularly

00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:22,710
responsible for paying attention ok so

00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,690
now for a little dirty laundry there are

00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:27,570
a lot of pollings and a certain number

00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:29,310
of mentors and it's not always true that

00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:31,140
we have enough mentor attention on the

00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:32,640
projects on any given day inside the

00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,860
incubator that's just the fact about

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,330
life at Apache and so with the project

00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,640
what the committee has come up with is a

00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:40,170
way of mitigating that difficulty a

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,510
little bit is a group of people called

00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:45,090
the shepherds so the shepherds are

00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:46,860
people who aren't specifically mentors

00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:49,440
of individual projects necessarily but

00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,240
who devote time and energy to looking in

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,070
on individual pod llings from time to

00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,690
time seeing how they're doing looking

00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:58,380
over their mailing lists looking at

00:24:54,690 --> 00:25:00,720
their releases um just giving a bit of a

00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,850
checkup to help the PMC as a whole

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,690
understand what's the state of health of

00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:09,660
the paddling so those are the Shepherd's

00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:13,080
gourds the bottom of the page are the pp

00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:15,360
and CI well labeled ppmc and committers

00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,920
which is to say the people who actually

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,690
are in the paddling the people doing the

00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,990
work now put them in the same color for

00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:24,810
a reason so in a full-blown running up

00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:27,060
and going a patching project there's a

00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:29,730
PMC these are people who have been

00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:32,430
elected by their peers and accepted by

00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:34,350
the board mind you that's pretty much a

00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:37,260
rubber stamp formality and who have

00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:38,580
actual responsibility for supervision of

00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,290
what goes and source control and what

00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,910
comes out as releases and then their

00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:43,830
committees committers are a much

00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:47,100
potentially larger group of people who

00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:49,290
are given permission to modify what's in

00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,120
the source control system so the

00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:52,500
committee's are just given permission to

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,030
go ahead and commit stuff that's how

00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,560
work gets done but the PMC are the

00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:57,240
people who actually are responsible for

00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,160
worrying about what's in there now when

00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,830
a paddling starts out there almost

00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,510
always exactly the same people in fact

00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:05,640
to tell you the truth there a number of

00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:06,750
full-blown operating top-level projects

00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,490
that Apache in which they're all the

00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:10,080
same people anyway many some projects

00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:12,600
that Apache just decide as a matter of

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,860
policy that anyone they trust enough to

00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,270
give them access to commit to the source

00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,980
code they're also going to give them

00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:18,900
authority as part of the committee other

00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:21,150
projects maintain this is a tus a

00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:23,520
two-phase process where you get commit

00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:25,290
access by showing some engagement with

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,820
the community you get PMC access if you

00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:30,180
hang around and participate in some

00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:32,190
larger ways so over time some paddling's

00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:35,040
choose to begin to stratify in that

00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:37,830
fashion frankly most don't most pod

00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:40,050
llings just maintain a prop ppm c which

00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,220
is all the committers and they worry

00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:45,539
about who's the PMC when

00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:47,340
time to graduate now when we have a

00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:51,000
proposal the next step in the process is

00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:52,980
there's a vote on that proposal so big

00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,070
secret it's hard to lose one of these

00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:57,330
votes I mean honestly the real reason

00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:59,190
it's hard to lose went to loot for one

00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:01,799
of these votes to fail is that what

00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:03,600
tends to happen is that proposals don't

00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:05,100
make it to a vote that don't have the

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,260
necessary wherewithal to be successful

00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:09,419
if you put up a proposal and it just

00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,760
does not seem like you have enough

00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:13,080
people or enough code or you have some

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,880
of those other problems I was talking

00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,500
about before a polite but firm

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,059
conversation will ensue on the mailing

00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,460
list and that will kind of be the end of

00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:22,440
that on my time around the incubator I

00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:29,010
have never actually seen one of these

00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:40,710
proposals be brought to a vote and then

00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:48,200
oh dear and then fail I don't really

00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:48,200
okay this is going to make a great video

00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:55,499
and I thought I turned all the necessary

00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:57,330
crap off um so a very important question

00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:59,190
about having a proposal that succeeds is

00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:00,749
to actually stop some mentors now if

00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:02,460
you're a lucky set of ducklings who are

00:28:00,749 --> 00:28:04,109
proposing to be a paddling you already

00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,700
have connections at Apache your mentors

00:28:04,109 --> 00:28:08,100
or people you know but more likely

00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,029
you've put up a proposal you set mail to

00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,999
the mailing yes and you said would

00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:13,799
anyone please mentor us and your ability

00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:16,080
to attract mentors will honestly depend

00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:18,059
on your win some ways and whether your

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,619
technology or subject matter attracts

00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:21,239
the attention of people if you beg hard

00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:25,559
enough though you can usually come up

00:28:21,239 --> 00:28:28,649
with some mentors now so you made a

00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:31,320
proposal the p.m. the ipmc voted you're

00:28:28,649 --> 00:28:34,409
in business now what okay a whole bunch

00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,669
of infrastructure happens um so that's

00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:39,450
not the order in which I put this on the

00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:42,269
slide silly me okay well so in order to

00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:44,519
get any code into Apache really why do

00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:46,559
we have a foundation what is the purpose

00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:48,809
of having a foundation as opposed to I

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,999
don't know a giant secret conspiracy or

00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:52,489
something the foundation is all about

00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:54,960
certain about intellectual property

00:28:52,489 --> 00:28:57,029
management the code that comes into the

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,859
foundation is licensed to the foundation

00:28:57,029 --> 00:29:01,440
the foundation licenses out to other

00:28:58,859 --> 00:29:03,269
people and as a result that limits the

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,249
liability of the people who work as

00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:07,109
volunteers in the foundation to certain

00:29:05,249 --> 00:29:09,029
kinds of potential legal and broadly

00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:10,649
otto's that could arise I am not

00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:13,859
qualified to talk about the details of

00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:15,629
that but how does the code get to be

00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:17,820
long get to be licensed the foundation

00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:19,590
there are basically two ways either a

00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,600
big lump of code is coming in all at

00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,919
once in which case it's granted to the

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,769
foundation by an individual or

00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:28,289
corporation or individuals are making

00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:30,989
contributions one commit or patch at a

00:29:28,289 --> 00:29:32,850
time individuals who are doing that have

00:29:30,989 --> 00:29:34,679
to file with the foundation a thing

00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:37,529
called an individual contributor license

00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:40,019
agreement which says that which which

00:29:37,529 --> 00:29:41,669
basically legally documents their

00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:45,480
willingness to contribute the code to

00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:46,889
the foundation so week or so that's one

00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,419
of the very first bootstrapping steps

00:29:46,889 --> 00:29:50,009
it's often the slowest one is for all

00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:52,320
the initial people on the on the

00:29:50,009 --> 00:29:54,359
committee in the paddling to say here is

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,460
my form you fax it into the foundation

00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:59,690
or you mail a scanned image to the right

00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:02,340
email address and things happen I

00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:04,020
already told you what a ppm c is

00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,789
so once you have once you have some

00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:08,370
accounts which you get as a result of

00:30:05,789 --> 00:30:10,700
filing your I CLA you can set up source

00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:15,750
control mailing lists bug tracking

00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:17,850
builds all that stuff okay you do this

00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:19,260
in fact by opening tickets in many cases

00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:21,059
by opening tickets in the Foundation's

00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,980
JIRA bug tracking instance past the

00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:24,299
infrastructure team politely to do

00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,610
things for you and these things all

00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:29,340
happen in a couple of days now to finish

00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:31,620
up on what I started with in most cases

00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:33,240
that i have seen paddling's come to the

00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:36,360
foundation with a non-trivial body of

00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,950
existing code okay that needs a little

00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,260
more legal handling than just one person

00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:44,669
submitting one patch on one day and for

00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:46,740
this we have the CC clas and sgas what a

00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:48,270
lot of alphabet soup a corporate

00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:50,669
contributor license agreement is what

00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:52,169
goes into place to allow in fact I think

00:30:50,669 --> 00:30:59,250
I have a slide with more details on this

00:30:52,169 --> 00:31:00,899
yeah so individuals make contributions

00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:02,580
individuals license their contributions

00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:04,169
you give us a form that says who are you

00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:06,270
are by the way you're trying to keep

00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:08,070
yourself a secret well not quite okay

00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:09,630
eventually that document is really a

00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:11,279
matter of public record though the

00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:12,929
foundation will indulge people and

00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,820
having user IDs that don't reveal their

00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:16,980
names sort of gratuitously all over the

00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:20,460
place once you file this you get an

00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,750
account now what if you're part of a

00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,909
corporation after all that's quite

00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:26,039
likely well if you're working for hire

00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:27,330
then your company proud the company you

00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:29,549
work for it probably has some rights to

00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:31,020
your work so your company also has to be

00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:33,390
willing to pitch that work into Apache

00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:36,210
for you to contribute it that's a ccla

00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:37,649
so if you're just all by yourself

00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,330
working in your spare time all you need

00:31:37,649 --> 00:31:41,370
is a nice ela if your if your work is

00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:43,080
work for hiring you to see CLA if in

00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:44,520
addition to that there's some giant ball

00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,380
code that already exists that you're

00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,270
bringing into the foundation and how big

00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,529
is giant I can't tell you we make up

00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:51,899
that answer that question every time

00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:53,429
when it comes up then there's a separate

00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:54,929
piece of legal documentation called a

00:31:53,429 --> 00:31:57,120
software grant agreement which is used

00:31:54,929 --> 00:32:01,559
to clarify the legal status of some

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:04,320
existing code coming in now okay yeah

00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:07,200
the last bullets important to this comes

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,059
up from time to time can your legal

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,799
department asked for modifications to

00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:15,840
these agreements no

00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:18,630
I've seen them turn down over and over

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,040
again so the foundation can't afford

00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:21,840
enough lawyers to get involved in

00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,179
negotiations on this so if you can't

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:27,540
learn to live with those agreements by

00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:28,830
and large you're out of luck now as

00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,540
you're setting up you have to answer a

00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:32,730
few policy questions for your project

00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:35,510
are you going to commit then review or

00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:37,950
review then commit or haven't you know I

00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:39,179
don't know a weekly Sabbath the full

00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:41,429
moon in which you make decisions about

00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:43,320
code most projects the foundation are

00:32:41,429 --> 00:32:45,690
simply commit then review or review then

00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:48,870
commit foundation doesn't care pick one

00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:51,240
document it stick to it who's going to

00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:53,010
commit okay I confess there's been a

00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,240
long controversial discussion about this

00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:56,790
around the foundation lately and I'm

00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,250
going to summarize it as follows the

00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:02,220
source control systems at Apache will

00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:04,260
allow you to say who's got access to

00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,299
commit to your project and you have to

00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:08,700
make some decisions do you want to say

00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:10,740
well we're very careful about who

00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,630
actually has physical permission to

00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:15,780
commit to this project or do you want to

00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:17,070
say huh early broad group of people in

00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:19,230
some cases as broad as the entire

00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:20,669
foundation have physical permission to

00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,260
commit but of course we have these

00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:24,150
policies than anybody who violates these

00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:26,100
policies will be spoken to sharply and

00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:28,440
maybe we'll then take away their access

00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:30,000
that's again your decision to make you

00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,760
have to decide how much structure to

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,980
have as I said a few minutes ago you've

00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,809
got to decide whether you're going to

00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,370
bother to distinguish between committee

00:33:36,809 --> 00:33:41,070
members who have responsibility and

00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:42,480
binding votes and committers who just

00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:44,130
have rights to commit to the code base

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,570
there are a lot of people who believe

00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:47,760
strongly that those two categories could

00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:49,470
be the same but not everybody the most

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,540
important thing however the most

00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:54,330
important aspect of this is don't build

00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:57,419
a moat and I'll explain that in a second

00:33:54,330 --> 00:34:00,330
so now you're up and running what

00:33:57,419 --> 00:34:02,130
happens okay well you got to get code

00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:04,080
right there's no project without code

00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:06,120
community a community is nice but it's

00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,040
here to make releases okay that means

00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,750
you have to have people that means that

00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,340
somehow or another your project has to

00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:13,200
be attractive to people to come and

00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,609
contribute to it people have to use it

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,560
people have to be interested in it this

00:34:14,609 --> 00:34:19,369
can be a hard bootstrapping problem not

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,080
everyone succeeds you make releases

00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:24,770
police's are a whole story and your

00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,770
mentors help you

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:31,230
now where are the contributions come

00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:34,379
from people who have commit access

00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:37,440
commit people who are PMC members they

00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:40,230
watch the process they watch content and

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,450
in very extreme cases you know I

00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,710
mentioned the idea of voting on code now

00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:45,569
again I'm not trying to do the whole

00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:49,109
foundations operational policy here in

00:34:45,569 --> 00:34:51,089
this talk but every once in a long while

00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:54,389
there really is an argument about some

00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:56,550
code and PMC members have the right to

00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:57,960
say no you can't commit that that might

00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:59,339
be because they think it's a really bad

00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,540
idea technically they might be because

00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:02,369
they think there are legal problems with

00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:05,130
it it comes up very infrequently but it

00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:07,800
comes up that's what PMC members have

00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:09,150
those votes committers don't ok PMC

00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,849
members have to vote to release things

00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,900
other people supply patches now an

00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:14,819
interesting thing about the apache

00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,829
licenses and one of your best recruiting

00:35:14,819 --> 00:35:18,900
techniques is the apache license says as

00:35:16,829 --> 00:35:21,359
part of using the content of the license

00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,250
you agree that if you give us a patch we

00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:25,410
can keep it unless you say something

00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:27,420
very specific to avoid that so anytime

00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:28,619
somebody sends you a patch that's code

00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,869
that can just be committed to the code

00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:33,000
base more importantly that's a person

00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:36,109
you can try to suck in again don't build

00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:41,490
a moat your job is to pull them in and

00:35:36,109 --> 00:35:45,420
in particular the biggest problem that

00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:47,250
paddling's have is growing if you now I

00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:51,030
was discouraged from writing up here

00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:52,920
grow or retire but you've got to get

00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:54,420
people into the paddling that's what's

00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:58,170
going to make the paddling us success

00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:59,609
and that's not always easy and so you're

00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:01,589
again I'm just sort of repeating myself

00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:03,480
your biggest challenge is to figure out

00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:09,359
how to attract people and get them to

00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:10,619
contribute and join the show now we

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,109
wouldn't be here if we weren't making

00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:14,970
releases so we're making releases or

00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:16,740
making releases of source code we're

00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:19,500
making releases of source code which fit

00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:21,510
under the apache legal umbrella this

00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,579
means that there are a whole bunch of

00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:25,559
niggly details that have to be right

00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:27,690
before a release is allowed to be a

00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:29,970
release and there are a few dedicated

00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:32,549
volunteers on the ipmc who make it their

00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:34,640
business to make sure that your release

00:36:32,549 --> 00:36:36,310
conforms to those niggling details in

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,140
glorious and

00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:40,510
perfect detail even sometimes a little

00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:42,250
more than is absolutely required and so

00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:43,780
what you should expect when you're being

00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:45,160
incubating you go to make a release is

00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:48,040
the first time you put up a release for

00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:50,560
a vote try though you may someone named

00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,120
se bebe by email address is going to

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,350
show up and give you a list of four or

00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,970
five things you got wrong that you'll

00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:57,400
have to fix that's just how it works and

00:36:54,970 --> 00:37:00,570
that's just life in the big city that's

00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,570
how that's what we're up to here

00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:07,480
decision-making Apache communities are

00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,430
open communities they make decisions in

00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,680
public they make decisions on mailing

00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:13,510
lists why do they make decisions on

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,370
mailing lists in the modern world of

00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,930
google hangouts and IRC and all this

00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:18,670
real-time stuff because that person

00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:20,890
who's ten time zones away from you

00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:22,450
cannot reasonably be expected to be

00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:25,720
there and participate in the process

00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:28,810
with you from ten time zones away so yep

00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:30,490
that slows you down and yeah you can get

00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:31,990
together in a hangout or at a bar or

00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:34,690
something and talk something through

00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:40,330
work it out with a formal decision has

00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:42,280
to be made on the mailing list now now

00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:44,950
we're reaching the end of the story at

00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,690
the end so so in order to get at we're

00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:48,610
trying to get rid of you okay the IP MC

00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:50,680
is drowning in things to do it needs to

00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:52,840
get rid of pollings okay our biggest

00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,400
problem as a PMC is to help paddling's

00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,290
get their act together and get out of

00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,980
there one way or the other so we so we

00:37:56,290 --> 00:38:01,420
can mentor the next group of people so

00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:03,610
you don't have to have a mature software

00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:05,380
product you do have to have a mature

00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:07,570
community there's a big spreadsheet

00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:09,010
essentially a kind of a four I know it's

00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:11,350
not really a spreadsheet but it shows up

00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:13,090
as a big diagram with a lot of columns

00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:15,670
on a pay called called called the clutch

00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:17,560
another one of these egg jokes okay and

00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:23,020
when all of your boxes are green we want

00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:24,970
to get rid of you now so what we'd like

00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:26,890
you to have by the way have seen you add

00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:29,950
a few people to your community as part

00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:32,080
of this process but not always entirely

00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:33,490
practical there are even exceptions made

00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,290
to that if you have a critical mass of

00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:36,760
people and you've been seen to have good

00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:38,320
relations with people who come and bring

00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:41,710
you patches and whatnot you may still

00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,600
graduate so when you are your mentors or

00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:45,640
some shepherd busy body decides it's

00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,020
time for you to graduate a resolution is

00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,670
drafted some piece of you know

00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,770
boilerplate legalese for the board that

00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:52,440
says hey you're

00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:54,480
object that gets put up for a discussion

00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,910
in your community you vote on it if we

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,920
if it passes with you it goes and gets

00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:00,480
voted at the general incubator list and

00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,220
if it passes you go on the agenda for

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,300
the next board meeting what about the

00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:08,010
footnote oh well of course at the board

00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,630
all I've never seen the board fail to

00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:12,870
accept one of these resolutions myself

00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:15,240
so the next step is generally beer now

00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:16,650
but I would be remiss if I didn't say a

00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,930
couple words about what happens if this

00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:22,200
doesn't work okay not every idea is

00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:24,150
viable community what's going to happen

00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,160
to you well your code is assuming your

00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:27,690
code past IP clearance the code is

00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,090
always there available under the apache

00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:31,710
license now maybe you can find a home

00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:33,480
with an existing TLP this happens

00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:35,340
sometimes it may be that your code

00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,840
really just makes sense as just part of

00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:39,690
the yet goo ecosystem of some existing

00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:43,560
project and some negotiation takes place

00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:45,690
and you join the show maybe not what's

00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:48,420
your worst case scenario your worst case

00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:50,400
scenario is that your project is retired

00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:52,530
the code gets put in to read onlys first

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,970
control space and it's available for

00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:58,650
everyone you can take it off somewhere

00:39:53,970 --> 00:40:01,310
else in your done and I'm done so

00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:01,310
questions

00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:11,990
apparently not

00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:29,940
alright well sort of this lightning bit

00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:32,280
of nonsense didn't entirely inform you

00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:43,280
you know various of us are around just

00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:43,280
ask if you have more questions yes yeah

00:40:54,260 --> 00:41:00,510
well III okay here here's what i can

00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,740
tell you about that if you're just if

00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:03,089
you just want to dabble on it's going to

00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:05,130
have to be our only question i'm told

00:41:03,089 --> 00:41:06,510
then you can certainly dabble under

00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,680
anonymity because under the apache

00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,510
license if you're just submitting

00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,339
patches we don't have to have a nice ela

00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,839
from you you can submit patches they can

00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:15,470
get committed that's great but as soon

00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:18,750
as you want to get karma on a project i

00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:20,760
cannot imagine any the foundation

00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:23,580
issuing a second apache ID to an

00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,770
existing person and now the only case

00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,940
i've seen is there is a guy i only know

00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:28,380
about this because it happened i watched

00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:31,650
it happen at the open office project

00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:33,330
from a distance on who chose an Apache

00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:36,089
ID which is completely obscure and

00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:38,280
unrelated to his name and whose name you

00:41:36,089 --> 00:41:40,349
know is there if you go looking but it's

00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,820
not obviously displayed anywhere but

00:41:40,349 --> 00:41:44,550
that's his one and only identity at

00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:46,380
apache so i can't give you a way to be

00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:48,690
two different people at apache if you

00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:50,369
want to be someone different if you want

00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:52,470
to be dr. Jekyll at apache and mr. hyde

00:41:50,369 --> 00:41:53,760
everywhere else you can do that to some

00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:56,180
woman at extent all right now I really

00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,180
