	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,930
morning so um can I just do a couple of

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,269
quick shows of hands to try and get a

00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,740
sense of what your experience level is

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,530
so I you know which kind of things to

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,929
concentrate on so if you are a member of

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:20,550
the apache software foundation can you

00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:22,410
raise our hand okay I may point to you

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,920
later on to help with some of the

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:29,550
questions if you're a committer can you

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:35,600
raise your hand squall Erika mrs. if you

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:40,020
have seen an Apache way talk before okay

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,820
so can you come to the front because i'm

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:52,110
going to point to you guys when I need

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:55,770
some help so I don't want this talk to

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,510
be a lecture with me standing at the

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,030
front and telling you exactly how it is

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,989
always because that's not really the

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:09,000
Apache way so what I'm going to try and

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:11,100
do is have questions coming in point to

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,159
various Apache members who all around

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,790
the room get them to feed in and try and

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,170
make this a bit more collaborative

00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:23,340
because that is at the heart of the way

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,979
that we develop our software so I do

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,780
have to stand roughly here and have the

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,810
mic on because it's being videoed and

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,579
but ideally we will we will try and make

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,049
it more collaborative gets and get some

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,850
input make sure that we focus on the

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,759
things that you really want to hear

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:41,460
about some of the things in my slide

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,170
deck duplicate what Jim's ended up

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,149
saying so I'll tend to skip over those

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,939
assuming that all of you got out of bed

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,009
in time to hear Jim speak but the slides

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:52,290
will be available later that we going

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,640
off on the website so hopefully won't

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,320
matter if I skip over some of those

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,729
because you can always come back later

00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,229
on have a look at them and they're more

00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:59,759
importantly discuss with your colleagues

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,290
and your friends and your communities

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,380
about some of the stuff that's been

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,060
mentioned and so I have to say a big

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,940
thank you to a few people who helped

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,150
with these slides and what would be

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,930
quite good as an idea if some people

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,640
want to write

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,310
code at some point is it be great if we

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,950
had some software that let us track the

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,409
branches and evolutions of the different

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:25,349
slide decks that have sort of folks

00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:27,150
emerge and things that would be great I

00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:30,359
mean we've got technologies like Apache

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,069
tikka that will make the work of getting

00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:34,290
the text out and I'm hopefully maybe

00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,819
some of the subversion guys will know

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,769
some great stuff about briefing the code

00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:39,150
and we can make it happen and I think

00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:41,069
that would sort of revolutionize the

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,769
Lord of presenting but in the meantime

00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:45,540
and if you've been to other Apache way

00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:47,459
to actually may you may see some of

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,889
these slides before and if you've got

00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,970
any feedback let me know afterwards and

00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:53,099
I can put them in and then the next

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,200
person who stands up to give the updated

00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:59,849
version is talk and can inherit from

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:02,669
them so what is the Apache way the short

00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:05,879
answer is it is this thing that we've

00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:09,209
come up with that lets us build code and

00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:12,989
communities and manage all despite the

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:14,189
problems that we face in the process so

00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:16,139
I'm going to try and cover a little bit

00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:17,729
about how the foundation works but I'll

00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:19,829
go quite quickly through that because

00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:21,840
Jim's covered a lot of it already try

00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:23,549
and talk about how we develop code what

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,560
we found that works and importantly what

00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:27,810
we found that hasn't really worked a

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,409
little bit around business on apache and

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:33,329
will be pointing around the audience so

00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:37,470
some history how did we get here today

00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:39,930
as Jim mentioned started out with the

00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:43,379
Apache group some people collaborating

00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:45,359
on a codebase a formerly abandoned

00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:47,009
codebase that they needed for their

00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:51,150
business and then used to get together

00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:55,739
work on it develop it and prove it that

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:59,489
was 95 they started sharing patches then

00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:02,579
in 99 there was a formal legal structure

00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:05,189
was needed so the apache software

00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:06,959
foundation was created and it's a

00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:09,569
virtual worldwide organization there's

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,229
not one office somewhere filled with

00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:15,449
coders and administrators and things

00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:17,729
would spread all around the world and we

00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:22,079
come together events like this to meet

00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:23,969
and actually put a face to a name and so

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,220
today we've got hundreds of projects

00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:29,520
some of them are tiny small

00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:32,790
breeze some of them are huge systems

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,130
like a deep many of them are critical

00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:37,950
pieces of infrastructure components that

00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:40,680
get built up into the systems that get

00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:43,500
used and deployed and we have some end

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,530
user tools as well like Open Office and

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:50,100
what we try to emphasize is the

00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:53,910
community the way of working the way of

00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,920
resolving problems which come up so by

00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,680
numbers as Jim said earlier we've got

00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,120
over 100 projects got 34 currently going

00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,210
through the incubator and I'll talk a

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,580
little bit about what the incubator is a

00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:09,060
bit later on they're over 500 members

00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:10,400
and and then got lots more people who

00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,380
are involved in different capacities

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,780
such as being committers and I see

00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:19,350
Eleison filed who've made significant

00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:22,140
contributions this is the list as of

00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:25,320
Saturday at the different projects we've

00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:27,270
got it's quite all them and I think

00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:33,900
we're still missing a why if any

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:37,860
incubating projects are due e that's

00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,419
what we heard on ivy hmm yes there's a

00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,790
couple of letters still to it still to

00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:45,300
go and if you think you put proposing a

00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:47,610
new project so instructions the

00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,080
foundation one way to view it which I'm

00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,490
not a big fan of because i think it

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,840
emphasizes the wrong things you have a

00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,370
project that's responsible for code and

00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:01,560
the board with the foundation above it

00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:04,020
the way i like to emphasize is that we

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,540
have a number of projects they are

00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,580
responsible for their code for their

00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:11,400
community and the direction that it's

00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:16,490
moving in the board is there to provide

00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:20,310
oversight but it's not got any impact on

00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:22,950
what code gets written the ball doesn't

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:25,740
say hmm I think what we really need is

00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:28,530
another big data solution and the board

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,030
doesn't turn up and go tomcat what we

00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,979
need you to do is we need you to add a

00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,080
new method in here and refactor that

00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:37,800
class that doesn't happen it's up to the

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,780
communities to decide what should be

00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,760
done where they should be going

00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:46,110
the foundation does provide the support

00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:48,919
to make easy to focus on the code and

00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:53,010
the community there are things that are

00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:54,720
not so good for volunteers to do things

00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:57,600
that don't tend to work well when

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,250
volunteers go who now you know I've got

00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,930
some other stuff to do some personal

00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,940
stuff to do we won't worry about that

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:05,790
and so the foundation tries to provide

00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,230
the support that means that the projects

00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:12,710
can concentrate on their code in their

00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:15,780
community hope we have apache labs and

00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:19,860
which is a place where committers can

00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:23,010
come together and try out an idea most

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:27,150
things go into the labs and then they

00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:29,970
finish it's an idea try it out some

00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:32,780
things either from within labs or from

00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:35,520
outside start to gain a bit of momentum

00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,979
there's some code there's some people

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,350
and they've heard about this Apache

00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:43,169
thing and they want to get involved in

00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:46,110
Apache and that's where the incubator

00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:50,000
comes in the incubator is the process

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:52,890
where a project enters the foundation

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,200
learns the way that the foundation works

00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:58,110
lens the way that we develop software

00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,780
loans the apache way and at the end of

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,580
that they will either graduate to a

00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,950
top-level project or within another

00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:07,590
top-level project or they would decide

00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:09,630
that maybe the the apache way is not for

00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,340
them and leave and there are some

00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,470
projects who come into the incubator try

00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,450
it out and go you know what actually

00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,370
this is not it's not the right fit for

00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,630
us it's not the right fit for kind of

00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,190
things we want to do the way we want to

00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:23,820
work and then they leave again and

00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:25,530
that's fine incubator is a so is a trial

00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,110
it's a process that people go through

00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:29,550
communities go through to build and I

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,680
believe there's a talk on the incubator

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,469
a bit later on and so if you're

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,440
interested in bringing a new project in

00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:40,050
to Apache when you want to know more

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,599
detail on what's involved and the ways

00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:44,760
of that your community would potentially

00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,800
need to change as you as you learn and

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,040
incorporate the Apache way then do go

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,959
into those talks alternately there's a

00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,900
barcamp happening tomorrow night we did

00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,790
a bar camp on

00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,680
may we have quite a few sessions on the

00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,840
incubator there there's a small barcamp

00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,120
happening tomorrow night so if you want

00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,790
to know more and you want to have a more

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:08,980
informal chat about it that's a good way

00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:10,690
to do it so I'm from the incubator

00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,570
something will go up to being a

00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:20,920
top-level project then we also have the

00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:23,620
attic software projects can last forever

00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,870
that the communities around them don't

00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:29,200
necessarily there are technologies that

00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:30,910
are no longer relevant that were at one

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,590
point really important but things have

00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:38,080
moved on and we try to explain to the

00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:42,220
world the state of the software within

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:44,170
the foundation so with the incubator if

00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,240
you look at the project it's branded as

00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:49,750
being part of the Apache Incubator the

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,760
releases are incubating releases that as

00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,160
someone thinking of using that software

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,520
you know that it's mostly playing by the

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,020
Apache way but maybe there are some

00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:01,450
issues maybe the community is still

00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:04,300
learning when it's something to

00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:07,990
top-level project you know that it will

00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:10,200
be working to the Apache way and it will

00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,940
have a diverse community that's and

00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,310
driving it on but it over time a project

00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,050
can can end up without that community

00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:19,090
where everyone has moved on to new

00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:21,220
things and then we try and make that

00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:24,610
clear to you as a potential user that

00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:27,340
this software no longer has an and that

00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:29,350
an active community around it if you

00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,630
want to you can come along and say hey

00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,860
and I know everyone else has got bored

00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,660
of that piece of software but actually

00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,640
it's important to us can we we bring it

00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,020
back out of the Attic can we will renew

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,870
community around it and that's finally

00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,550
it does sometimes happen but often it's

00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:46,750
just reached the end of its natural life

00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:49,360
and we need to say a sad goodbye to it

00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:53,290
and then put it the bits will still be

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,660
there that community has gone and the

00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:58,960
apache way is not all plain sailing we

00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:01,720
have had problems many of them and not

00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:04,200
all of which are around massive massive

00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:08,850
mailing lists threads but many of them

00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:12,290
to involve that the sort of the most

00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:15,660
well-known of our of our failings was

00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:17,970
Jakarta Jakarta was a great success in

00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:21,480
terms of the software produced but it

00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:24,120
did have issues around its community and

00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,480
so what happened was that Jakarta was an

00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:31,350
umbrella so almost all the Java projects

00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:35,640
at Apache we're within the the Jakarta

00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:38,190
band Tomcat struts and and so on and and

00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,810
then the side to be problems around who

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,490
was responsible for it who was going to

00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:43,680
provide the oversight for it when things

00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,690
started to go wrong when things stopped

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,420
being properly according to the Apache

00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:51,440
way whose responsibility was it to help

00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:55,470
guide it back onto the the correct path

00:11:51,440 --> 00:12:00,170
an Avalon was the project that really

00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:03,270
triggered that and it showed to the

00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:05,580
foundation as a whole that we needed to

00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:07,800
have the same model for all of our

00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:11,760
projects having these different lawyers

00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:15,690
confuse things so now we have no

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,940
projects and our are equal within the

00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:20,970
eyes of the board and all projects

00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,880
submit reports every quarter but they're

00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:25,500
not focused on the technology it's not a

00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,270
sort of management thing where you say

00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,950
oh these are the four new features we

00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,120
added in and do you want to give us some

00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,740
feedback on if those were the right

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,860
features it's not about that at all it's

00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:37,350
about the community project saying hey

00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,930
we've added some new people we've had

00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:42,900
some problems we've been following the

00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:45,120
apache way as best we can and every saw

00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:49,230
from the board does intervene when

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,850
things go wrong and we can tell you more

00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:55,920
about that over beers generally if

00:12:50,850 --> 00:13:03,000
you're interested so our our ecosystem

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:05,280
and the board doesn't pick a winner we

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,890
can and do have multiple projects

00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:10,340
working in the same space when we

00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:13,770
consider that to be a good thing because

00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:16,440
while many of us are great coders great

00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:18,490
developers none of us unfortunately can

00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,170
see into the future and say

00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:23,560
that project there that's the one that's

00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:26,440
going to win and what we want to do is

00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,510
have communities decide communities of

00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,980
developers people are in documentation

00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,850
during the testing they're the people

00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:36,250
that should be deciding on the direction

00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:38,260
so we will often have more than one

00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:41,350
project because there are different ways

00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:42,279
to solve the problems we face and we

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:46,180
want to support those different

00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:49,390
communities and when projects coming to

00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:51,339
the incubator if they are trying to

00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:54,310
focus on an area where we've already got

00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:57,790
project we'll ask them generally to

00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:59,290
explain why they're different that can

00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,399
sometimes be a hard question for a

00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:03,820
community but it's an important one

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:06,820
because if a new developer is going to

00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:10,020
come along and say I need some software

00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:13,630
that's going to serve web pages and

00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:16,870
Apache has three different projects that

00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:20,770
can serve web pages if the communities

00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:22,510
can't explain why they're different no

00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:24,850
more than three the communities can't

00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:27,010
explain why they're different it's going

00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,510
to be hard for end-users to decide which

00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,250
one they should use and it's going to be

00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,959
hard for contributors to pick which is

00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:34,450
going to be the right community for them

00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:36,520
to get involved it we have multiple

00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:38,320
projects that work on serving web pages

00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,950
because they solve different problems

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,029
and they sold them in different ways and

00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:44,800
their own friends they don't hate each

00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:47,470
other there's a little bit of sort of

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,850
friendly rivalry between them but they

00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,589
all collaborate together and you can go

00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,600
to them and say this is the kind of

00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:55,060
problem i'm facing which which one's

00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,350
going to be the best option for me and

00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,510
they might say it's traffic forever they

00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,250
might say it's httpd or they might even

00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:02,440
say actually fit for the problem you've

00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:04,959
got you want to go in use engine X and

00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,570
it's not an Apache project but the

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:11,589
community will coalesce around an idea

00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:14,500
and form that idea will come the code

00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:16,329
and then from the code you can then use

00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,750
it and build your business and solve

00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:22,720
your your problems and as I mentioned

00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:26,620
there are a few foundation things other

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,720
than code that exists to make the job of

00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,649
writing the code easier so we've got the

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,259
infrastructure team who provides

00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:35,389
the support the the systems needed to

00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:39,110
build your software store your software

00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:42,259
discuss the software archive it there's

00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:44,420
the legal team who and try and answer

00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:47,629
the questions that the foundation has

00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:50,179
around legal the patchy does not provide

00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:52,189
legal advice to people outside the

00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:53,809
foundation but we do have some volunteer

00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:55,970
lawyers who can answer questions around

00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:58,550
some of the trademark stuff some

00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:00,980
relicensing stuff travel assistance

00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:04,970
committee help get people to conferences

00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:06,800
public relations committee and deal with

00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,410
the interface to the outside world

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,209
especially from press and got the

00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,679
Security Response Team marks one of

00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:14,209
them's off I believe you're going to be

00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:15,949
speaking a bit later on if you want in

00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:18,319
the week if you want to know more about

00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:19,699
how that works fundraising which is

00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:22,429
important because the servers need

00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:25,550
replacing and sort of thing from

00:16:22,429 --> 00:16:27,199
conferences so that's provided a

00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,790
foundation level so that each project

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,920
doesn't have to worry about it so the

00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:33,740
projects can focus on what's important

00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:37,279
em which is their code the direction the

00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:40,850
community they're going in nearly

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:47,679
everything that Apache is volunteer

00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:50,899
based and we don't as a foundation have

00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:55,100
foundation paid people writing code on

00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:58,730
the projects much of the code written at

00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:01,999
Apache is done by people working for a

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:06,439
company being paid but they're not being

00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:08,630
paid by the foundation there are a few

00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:11,510
paid contractors who kind of keep the

00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:12,860
servers running and answer the phone

00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:17,319
when the press rings and that kind of

00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:20,510
thing but everyone is there as volunteer

00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:24,740
that's important because it avoids the

00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:26,149
issue with people not being equal if

00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,980
you've got some people are being paid by

00:17:26,149 --> 00:17:30,490
foundation and some people are

00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,600
volunteering there's a hierarchy there

00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,919
and even if you don't mean for there to

00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,970
be a hierarchy there there will be a

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:40,789
hierarchy there everyone is equal then

00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:42,409
you can have or at least you've got a

00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:42,940
sporting chance of having a neurotic r

00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:46,270
attic

00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:51,120
structure so if you want something done

00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:57,850
you need to step forward and volunteer

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:58,960
so mentioned merit a few times and we

00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:04,210
can sometimes talk about a chain of

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:05,680
merit so what generally happen the way

00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:08,410
that I think most of us who are involved

00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:11,920
in Apache got involved is that we had a

00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:15,970
problem and we found a piece of software

00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:18,280
that nearly solved that problem and we

00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:21,610
joined the mailing list we posted a

00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:24,970
query saying hey and how do I do this

00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:28,450
I've started got partway how do I do

00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:31,330
this and probably the answer came back

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:32,530
are you're going to have to solve a bug

00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:35,260
or you're going to have to add a new

00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:37,860
feature because if you're a committer

00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:41,560
that means that you've written some code

00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,820
or written some documentation or three

00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,650
hours and bugs or something like that

00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:47,950
you've made a contribution so if you've

00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:50,320
become a committer you will have given

00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,700
something back to the project so working

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,460
the committee's here will have come

00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:56,020
along they've had a problem that we've

00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,780
solved that problem added that new

00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,970
feature solve that bug written the

00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,640
missing piece of documentation triage

00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:04,540
all the bugs that got the problem solved

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,700
and they'll be making these

00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:08,260
contributions back to the project saying

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,140
hey here's the new piece of

00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,970
documentation I think you should have

00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:15,600
and so in or later that projects will

00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:19,270
get fed up with having to take the patch

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:22,000
review it commits it take the patch

00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:23,860
applies the documentation tree publish

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,340
it and they go you know what you've

00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:28,900
shown merit you've shown that maybe your

00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,910
codes not perfect but it's good enough

00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,770
and that you were playing well with

00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:34,000
others and we want to make you a part of

00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,430
our project we want to give you the

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,980
ability to make changes to our source

00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:45,000
tree a documentation tree our bug

00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:47,230
tracker array yourself then once you've

00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,940
you then have the ability to make

00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:54,070
changes as a committed to that whole

00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:55,480
area it's not then governed by the

00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:57,930
technological things

00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:03,820
there's a sort of social thing in place

00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:06,460
so mark here works on tomcat he can make

00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:10,210
changes to any bit of the Tomcat source

00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:12,580
tree he wants technically but there be

00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,810
areas the tree that he knows well there

00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,270
was to the tree that he doesn't know

00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:18,040
well there were changes he might want to

00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,420
make that a very minor very trivial and

00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,520
he knows he can just go in and everyone

00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:24,160
would be happy but if he was going to

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,350
maybe go in and say yo that that piece

00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,880
of support there I don't I don't need it

00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,580
anymore I'm just going to delete that

00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:33,940
whole tree he might have the technical

00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,230
ability to make that change because he

00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,540
knows the community he'll go to the

00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:39,220
means and say hey I think we maybe don't

00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:42,280
need that bit of code anymore would

00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:43,750
anyone object if I removed it does

00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:47,470
anyone see any reason why we should keep

00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:49,360
it or can we tidy that area up and then

00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:52,180
as a community everyone sits around goes

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,830
well you know that codes old it's not

00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,540
needed anymore let's get rid of it let's

00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,070
let's Kenny things up all now hang on a

00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,340
minute no no that's still important for

00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:01,860
me we shouldn't we shouldn't remove that

00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:04,930
there is a difference there between a

00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:07,210
committer having the technical right to

00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:10,060
make the change and having the social

00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,920
permission of the whole community to go

00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:15,220
ahead and add that feature make that

00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:18,340
change remove that stuff and the project

00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:21,400
members are sometimes all the committers

00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:24,490
or a subset of the committers who can

00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:28,900
make a binding decision in the event of

00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:33,460
a release or a debate coming down to

00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:38,620
needing a vote votes are rare we have a

00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:43,420
process around voting minus 1 plus 10

00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:46,530
but they should be where ideally part

00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:50,620
the apache way is around the consensus

00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:52,060
we can vote to resolve but it's much

00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,980
better if we can just discuss and

00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,540
everyone goes actually yeah yeah that

00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,370
that is the right way to go we don't

00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,200
need a vote for that we've all we've all

00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:02,290
seen the explanation and we've we've

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:05,340
come up decided that that's the as the

00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:05,340
way that our community should go

00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:11,170
different ways of contributing are all

00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:17,390
valid so you can become a committer

00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:21,380
without having made code changes norine

00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:25,700
is one of sadly a small number of people

00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:30,920
who were elected as a committer for work

00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:33,200
other than code as we are not perfect we

00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:35,750
do though all of these things we don't

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,040
necessarily value them enough and we

00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:41,059
don't necessarily provide enough

00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:43,130
mentoring to people to come in as most

00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:45,290
of us who are committed I'll committers

00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:47,510
through code so that's the route we know

00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:49,160
well so when someone new comes into our

00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:51,200
community and says hey I want to get

00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,600
involved through coding we all know how

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,070
to help someone new comes in and says

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,520
hey I want to get involved in helping

00:22:55,070 --> 00:23:00,170
with your documentation that's out of a

00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,140
lot of our comfort zone so it's harder

00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:05,900
for us to mentor and so sadly we do miss

00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:08,000
out on some areas contributions it's not

00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:10,370
a perfect system and it's something that

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,510
as a community we need to think about we

00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:14,420
need to look at it and go there is a

00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:17,750
whole wall in our community we need to

00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:20,059
do something to improve that as if our

00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,530
documentation is better we have fewer

00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:23,600
people asking us questions on the

00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:25,580
mailing list about things that should be

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,750
the answer to there'd be a lot of people

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:33,559
who if they hit a problem won't have the

00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:36,980
confidence to join the list and post the

00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:38,929
question if we can solve their problem

00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,670
in advance through documentation they

00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:41,990
can build their confidence up and then

00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:45,380
they can join the list and then they can

00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:46,760
participate if we've got that hole in

00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,530
the documentation if we've got those

00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,720
bugs that are just being ignored and not

00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:54,200
triaged then we'll lose those potential

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,240
contributors and the value of our

00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,470
software is around the value of the

00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,929
community around it so we need to be

00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:01,490
welcoming and try and bring people in

00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:02,420
and I'm going to appreciate all the

00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:07,490
different kinds of merit and all the

00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:12,650
different kinds of contributions now the

00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:15,110
merit un does not by you authority so as

00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:17,540
we said mark can technically make change

00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:19,250
to any part of the Tomcat codebase marks

00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,830
also on the infrastructure team so he

00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,860
can make

00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:27,710
change and change any of our code but he

00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,710
knows that that's unlikely to be popular

00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:37,250
so mark might have the technical ability

00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:40,140
but he doesn't have the community buy-in

00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:44,220
so as you gain merit within the

00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:47,549
foundation you get privilege but you do

00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:49,799
not necessarily get the authority so the

00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:53,510
community agrees on the direction of the

00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:56,370
project but individuals make it happen

00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:59,700
you can't have the community say we want

00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:02,490
this new feature some magic coding very

00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:04,889
appear and waiver won't make it make it

00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:06,570
happen community decides what needs to

00:25:04,889 --> 00:25:08,880
be done but there will be individual

00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:11,580
members of that community who are going

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:17,340
to actually write the code right the

00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:20,250
documentation fix the bugs most

00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:23,789
decisions are reversible there were a

00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:26,700
few that are not conferences being one

00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:29,490
of them you can't say all well I know we

00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:31,260
signed a contract for a hotel venue but

00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:35,820
actually you know the bugs come up I

00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:40,610
think we might just slip it a week most

00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:43,649
other things are reversible and can wait

00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:46,799
for very small changes you we have lazy

00:25:43,649 --> 00:25:49,230
consensus and we encourage it you know

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:51,500
say hey and what I'm going to be doing

00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:54,929
is I think we should be adding this new

00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:56,850
parser to Apache tika and then I go off

00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:58,260
and i work on it and I commit it and I

00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:01,740
commit it and I get feedback and it's

00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:03,389
all fine for controversial changes all

00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:06,990
things that are going to be irreversible

00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:09,659
and we encourage your weight of at least

00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:12,720
72 hours and in some cases we need a

00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:15,330
vote especially if it's something like a

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,870
release where the foundation is going to

00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:21,090
take legal responsibility for it we do

00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:23,100
we do require that there be a vote but

00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:25,529
for most things you just put a post the

00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,990
list and say hey I think we should do

00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:29,970
this if the tumble we come through then

00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,980
it's probably uncontroversial if you're

00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:33,149
lucky someone will come in and say hey

00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,289
yeah that's a really good idea

00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:35,940
but you should go and look at that other

00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:40,519
project over there who've done something

00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:45,479
similar and get an idea from that so

00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:49,320
plus 1 minus 10 when we do have a vote

00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:53,009
those are the voting options we try and

00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:55,469
avoid the minus 1 and we in almost all

00:26:53,009 --> 00:26:58,739
cases require it have a reason you can't

00:26:55,469 --> 00:27:03,059
just say minus 1 and to say minus 1

00:26:58,739 --> 00:27:05,129
because and explain it so if someone's

00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:07,229
proposing a controversial change to a

00:27:05,129 --> 00:27:11,309
project and you don't want it to go

00:27:07,229 --> 00:27:14,070
ahead you can't just say nope nope nope

00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:16,409
nope we've got to say we shouldn't do

00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,729
that and here is the reason why we

00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:19,070
shouldn't do that and then as a

00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:20,940
community you can look at and go

00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,529
actually no that is a good point

00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:27,539
something we've forgotten something

00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:32,359
we've missed let's stop let's revisit we

00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:35,669
have a lot of lists so one of the things

00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:38,070
about apache is that things need to

00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:40,289
happen on the mailing list if it didn't

00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:43,469
happen on the mailing list it didn't

00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:46,349
happen because people are spread all

00:27:43,469 --> 00:27:48,089
around the world we welcome

00:27:46,349 --> 00:27:52,679
contributions from people wherever they

00:27:48,089 --> 00:27:55,469
are in the world and if we have a

00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:57,239
decision made with just me and mark

00:27:55,469 --> 00:27:58,859
having a chat starting on the future of

00:27:57,239 --> 00:28:02,009
tom cat 2 setting that we're going to

00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:03,719
remove that hold pesky and I don't know

00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:05,849
window support that's just it's awkward

00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:07,469
let's just remove it and the two of us

00:28:05,849 --> 00:28:11,549
just kind of sit down over a beer

00:28:07,469 --> 00:28:14,129
apparently decide it done no one else

00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:16,169
who's not in the room people aren't in

00:28:14,129 --> 00:28:18,359
the room con joining that participation

00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:19,919
can't can't get involved the decision if

00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:22,820
we have that discussion on the mailing

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,669
list everyone can see what's happening

00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:28,830
they can participate then and there

00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:31,440
which is good but they can also come

00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:34,830
back later and see what happened so when

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,509
I join a new project I can go back

00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:42,010
through the mailing list archives and

00:28:36,509 --> 00:28:45,550
see how they got where they are today so

00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:49,030
another mentioning that point is if you

00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:51,900
are a lot of Daniel uses of had nativity

00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:55,650
you can make a decision or you're doing

00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:58,090
decisions do take longer at the NSF and

00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:00,760
you just have to get used in to slow

00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:02,500
things down sending an email giving me a

00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:05,290
chance to really think about it

00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,880
digestive response with varun lines you

00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:08,590
might have any discussion somebody's on

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,960
the opposite side of royalties and

00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:12,760
apples a little you write something they

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,300
require 12 hours later you replied

00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:20,650
careful so can you say that not exactly

00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:22,990
with it taking a solid respect what

00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:28,900
you're going to say rather just add your

00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:31,540
own not like that total defective you do

00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,040
get to the right decision in the end it

00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,840
just takes that little bit more

00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,910
abilities were defending the time

00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:41,620
because anticipate engulfed the arm oh

00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:45,040
my you made a decision so we have a lot

00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:46,060
of lists they're the main ones if you're

00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,430
going to be getting involved the new

00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:51,910
project is there's going to be a dev

00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:55,570
list which is where the discussions

00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:58,060
around the code of the project will

00:29:55,570 --> 00:30:01,630
happen there is going to be a commits

00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:10,390
list I think there's always a commits

00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:12,880
let's play ball no yeah so though there

00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:16,690
will be a list where all of the changes

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,860
to issues and the code base go maybe

00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,530
that's a separate list maybe that with

00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:23,080
the dev list many but not all projects

00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:26,830
have a user list where you can go and

00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:28,900
ask questions about how to use the

00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:32,290
project so if I have a question about

00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:34,480
how to use Tomcat I'll go to the user

00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:37,210
list if I have a question about how to

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,040
change Tomcats how to extend it how to

00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:42,880
put new feature in now be going to the

00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:44,590
to the dev list and many of our lists

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,200
are archived so if you want to go and

00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:51,520
find out what's been said in the past

00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:54,250
then the mail archives are there no

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:59,570
jerks allowed

00:30:54,250 --> 00:31:03,050
it's an important thing and we need to

00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:08,480
be welcoming we need to grow our

00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:11,240
community people will drop out of a

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,890
community naturally their personalized

00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:17,720
change their interests at work change

00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:19,970
people will always be leaving our

00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,580
communities reducing their involvement

00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:26,570
in community so we need to bring new

00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:30,890
people in we try through the apache way

00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:33,890
to have a welcoming self-sustaining set

00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:36,590
of community but if people are being

00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:38,900
nasty it's going to scare off new

00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:40,460
committers new contributors and if we

00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,440
scare them off then who's going to

00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:46,070
maintain the project in two years three

00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:50,500
years four years trolls that sadly do

00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:53,740
exist on the internet don't feed them

00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:57,220
remember that when you send an email

00:31:53,740 --> 00:32:02,720
there is someone on the other end

00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:05,420
critique the code not the person after

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:09,440
the talk in the keynote earlier it's

00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:13,120
fine to say that code has a problem it's

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,650
not very fun to say you have a problem

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,000
so try and remember that there are

00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:20,480
people haven't good days people and bad

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,970
days critique the cove critique the

00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:27,380
ideas not the people and if you haven't

00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:28,700
seen the torque it's well worth having a

00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:32,810
having a watch that it's really

00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:34,280
interesting and and many of us can learn

00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:38,090
something from that about our own

00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:39,920
behavior many of us will have traits in

00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:41,510
our personalities that can be

00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,910
problematic for others so we can have a

00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:46,430
watch of that and learn how to be a

00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:49,970
better participation a bit a better

00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:52,820
participant in our communities and got a

00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:55,640
few minutes left so very quickly there

00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:58,820
are different ways for contributions to

00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:00,380
be accepted and companies are a great

00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:03,290
way for those contributions to come in

00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:05,270
because when i get home from work I have

00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:06,260
a few hours but I'm also going to need

00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:08,690
to

00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:10,130
dinner read a book clean my flat that

00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,620
kind of thing if I can do some of that

00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:14,120
stuff in the day in the working day then

00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:16,520
there'll be more time I can spend on the

00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,490
project and we understand from that

00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:21,380
you're the license is structured to

00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:24,590
encourage companies to use our software

00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,820
and build on top of it and build their

00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:27,530
business on top of it because if their

00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,240
business is born to the software and

00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:31,220
their business is booming they'll have

00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,600
more money to contribute to make our

00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:38,300
communities better to make our code

00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:41,540
better and but everyone who is involved

00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:46,130
in Apache everyone who's a committer but

00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:50,060
is there as themselves you do not have

00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:54,400
an a company elected to commit you have

00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:56,890
individuals companies cannot buy

00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:00,440
committer ship they cannot buy access

00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:02,450
all they can do is encourage their

00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,850
employees to do good stuff for the

00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:07,280
project and then those employees will

00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:10,760
gain the merit and can make the changes

00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:13,550
for the company and we don't allow BBFS

00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,139
benevolent dictators for life that's

00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:17,090
something that can be a problem for

00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:20,270
projects coming into the incubator who

00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:22,730
have got a history of having one person

00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:27,320
who is deemed to have the true vision

00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:31,550
the true voice and we let everyone have

00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:32,929
a say and and we have a we try and

00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:35,659
encourage the projects have lots of

00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:37,669
companies involved so that that way the

00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:41,179
project is not beholden to one company

00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:43,520
if there were ten companies involved in

00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:44,870
a project and one of them gets brought

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,870
out one of them has a change of

00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:49,250
direction that community will survive

00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:52,550
there's only one company involved in a

00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:54,530
project and the company gets brought out

00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:57,350
company goes bust company decides to

00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:59,120
change direction that whole projects is

00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:01,640
then going to be dead so by encouraging

00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:03,770
lots of companies to be involved lots of

00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:08,020
individuals lots of organizations we

00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:08,020
know that it will survive any one person

00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:15,770
and by taking part in apache you're

00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,320
working on what you want to work on no

00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:19,800
one can force you I can you know that

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,440
there might be a bug in tom

00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:26,520
I can't say mark you must fix that bug

00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:28,110
for me I can maybe say hey Mark can you

00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:31,020
give me some help with me fixing that

00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:32,550
buck or I can say hey Mark can you give

00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:34,980
me the phone number of your sales guy so

00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:39,180
that I can pay your company to fix it

00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:41,460
for me but I can maybe give marks and

00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:44,340
beer until he fixes it for me but I

00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:46,560
can't say this bug is important to me

00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:49,740
and someone other than me must make it

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,100
fixed so we work on what we want to work

00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:55,440
on work on it when we want to work on it

00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:57,690
and we learn from the best there are

00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,750
some amazing people in our communities

00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:04,050
that we can learn from and we need to be

00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:07,590
humble and listen to them learn from

00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:08,910
them the codes are open that's one of

00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:11,100
the things is that the discussions are

00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:12,900
open the list archives are open so you

00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,910
can go back and look and see why a

00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,250
decision was made you can look at the

00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:24,540
code see what the change was and learn

00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:25,950
from it and our work is visible all

00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:29,790
those posts you make to the mailing

00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:32,760
lists are archived searchable index of

00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:35,310
all the code you write is available to

00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:38,040
everyone will be available forever and

00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:41,310
it's there and that's generally a good

00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:46,200
thing but occasionally people get caught

00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:47,880
out and and will send emails asking for

00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,910
things to be removed and generally

00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:53,430
that's not something we support so do

00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:55,380
remember when you participate that

00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:57,450
you're participating as you with your

00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:00,060
your name on it and think of that and

00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:01,950
it's generally a good thing and we have

00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:05,760
a permissive license I think there's

00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:08,610
some more things on the license and what

00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,690
that allows you to do and equally

00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:11,160
importantly what you're not allowed to

00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:14,520
do which is joanie around trademarks

00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:19,560
happening a bit later so the apache way

00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:21,630
works it's a process it's a way of

00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:25,760
developing software a way of building

00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:25,760
communities collaborating and

00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,920
it will not work for everyone will not

00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,510
work for all kinds of projects will not

00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,270
solve all business problems but it'll

00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:36,770
work for many of them and some things

00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:40,460
can seem hard at first but there's

00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:43,520
generally a reason why as Mark said

00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:46,100
about the decisions waiting yes it does

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,810
take longer if I have to write an email

00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:50,060
to the main lift saying this is the

00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:52,640
change I want to make and then wait for

00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:55,250
Mark to reply wait for someone in

00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,960
Australia to reply that's going to take

00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:59,420
longer than just going hey Mark sure we

00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,510
make that change yet done what we've now

00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:04,520
got that archive that information

00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:07,630
everyone can participate so it's harder

00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:11,650
but there's a value to it ask questions

00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:14,750
much of the Apache way is documented

00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:16,540
it's documented on the websites there

00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:19,640
are talks you can get the slide decks

00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:23,060
there are video recordings audio

00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:24,080
recordings you can learn but ask people

00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:26,390
can point you in the right direction

00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:29,960
because it is spread out and it's a

00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:31,820
collective discovered process someone

00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,890
didn't come down from up on high and say

00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:35,930
these are the four rules that make up

00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:38,090
the Apache way we try different things

00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:39,980
out and came up with something so if you

00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:41,570
if you want to know why something is or

00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:43,820
how something is or where you can learn

00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:46,970
more asking people wore point and

00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:51,820
possibly go yet it's a give me 10

00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:56,120
minutes not just fix yet look it's rare

00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:57,740
so we've got a few minutes left for

00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,020
questions if anyone wants to ask

00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:01,550
anything now otherwise can I get all the

00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:07,010
Apache members to put their hands up

00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:10,460
again if you have any queries find any

00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:14,390
of us later and ask us find people with

00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:17,300
the ask me badges and ask us we may not

00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:20,600
know the answer but we probably will

00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:23,390
know someone who will do so we can we

00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:25,220
can kind of direct you towards it so any

00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:27,400
any questions for the five minutes we've

00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,400
got

00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:34,390
I'm Yolanda yield from USC I'm Utah

00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:37,660
watching and I guess I'm more on the

00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:40,780
users by not a developer professional

00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:43,240
music so I'm familiar with the devil 3c

00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:45,850
processes and they also emphasize a lot

00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:48,730
from census so my question has to do

00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:50,770
with how do you facilitate consensus we

00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:55,120
didn't talk a lot about that but you

00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:57,820
mentioned is very important so part of

00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:00,300
the mechanisms that WBC offers and so

00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:04,090
I'm asking to see what what do you have

00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:07,570
so they offer telecom support and

00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:09,580
note-taking report from the calls I

00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:13,020
think it's easier sometimes to resolve

00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:15,620
things my voice rather than by email

00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:18,880
although the know

00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:23,450
again they have consensus

00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:26,120
recommendations from leaders there's

00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:27,730
also you know you talked about the

00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:32,000
mailing list but for example the other

00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:34,460
wikis where you can live for not just

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,200
the discussions as they happen but the

00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:38,600
products of those discussions and

00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,720
document where things are adding a group

00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:44,420
slide they also have this notion of the

00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:47,840
groups have a mission or a goal that you

00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:50,690
can articulate so I just wonder what

00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:53,780
exists in a party to support consensus

00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:56,390
because I agree it's very important so

00:40:53,780 --> 00:41:01,940
wondering what you have mostly we have

00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:10,130
mailing lists and wiki's and code bases

00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:16,970
that support going back if need be they

00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:21,550
clear this is the new software does tom

00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:21,550
cat is to implant a given handle

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:30,140
in terms of the consensus really it's

00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:32,570
the wiki's of their fuckups intend to

00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:35,210
use in its most of discussion we are

00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:37,550
tech discussion cual amazingness and it

00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:41,900
consensus is generating reach over

00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:43,900
processor time Lena and the discussion

00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:46,760
is going back

00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:49,790
I don't think going back and it's going

00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:52,190
on boats I can't remember the last time

00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:55,100
we had technical Vogelsong count over

00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:57,560
should we do it this way or that way I

00:41:55,100 --> 00:42:01,300
think part of the reason for that is the

00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:03,890
consensus of SF is not about agreement

00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:06,410
sisters Melanie me at least do it this

00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:09,260
way don't have a sense of the leader

00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:12,140
bringing us along time consensus is

00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:16,010
about consent do you consent to allow

00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:19,040
people do the same fight experiment to

00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:21,800
to put this in place straight for your

00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:24,080
great functionality you allow that to

00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,850
happen and if it turns out that

00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,490
something that was needed a new school

00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:29,310
edibles

00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:31,590
dry and it turns out that it was all

00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:34,290
through our path and something that's

00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:44,100
going to be a big thing then it falls by

00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:47,369
the wayside very good Jocasta I got my

00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:50,040
being tried every street create a branch

00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:52,800
trying to forget get a group of people

00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:54,270
on that branch the communities so get

00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,610
some hard facts that's improving the way

00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:59,220
of doing it and couldn't cut roughly

00:42:56,610 --> 00:43:04,320
with us done in good guys Roger the

00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:07,890
chamber one of the neighbors probably

00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:10,740
one of the ietf principal brown

00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:11,910
consensus and running code which kind of

00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,170
detail is generally talk about the

00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:15,390
direction you're headed but if you can't

00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:17,880
distill those ideas into great software

00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:21,360
then that's kind of improve the ground

00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:23,880
that either your password right and by

00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:26,250
suggesting an idea to also you know a

00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:28,680
common retort actually when there's the

00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:30,120
date is patches accepted which means you

00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:32,070
know if you have a good idea but you

00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,780
still haven't convinced people generate

00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:36,060
a patch that shows that as a better

00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:38,170
candidate means not only works but maybe

00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:41,220
even simplifies code

00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:41,220
that's a technical that

00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:47,140
yeah we do we try and use the mailing

00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:49,390
list to discuss it but as a lot of

00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:52,660
people have said if you can't reach a

00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:55,420
conclusion based on just the words let

00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:57,730
the code or the documentation speak for

00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:59,860
itself and so mark goes one way I go

00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:03,130
another we come back two weeks later and

00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:04,600
then we go well Nick's idea look the

00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:06,370
best in theory when we were discussing

00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,830
on the list but now you're actually seen

00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:10,420
the code marks one was the white one and

00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:11,710
Mark we are but there was this one thing

00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:13,840
that Nick did write song a pinch that

00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:17,230
one bit from next and put that in mine

00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:20,290
copied over trunk consensus has been

00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:22,660
reached by the discussion by the code

00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:24,790
where the evidence of it and then we can

00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,140
go well that was a great idea but that's

00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:28,380
the code we need that's the way we need

00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,380
to go

00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:53,210
so there's believe that we list of that

00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:59,190
okay we're out of time now but if you

00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,720
want to talk more find any of the

00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:03,800
members later or get involved in the

00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:07,849
barcamp or just bug us and I think Shane

00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,849
