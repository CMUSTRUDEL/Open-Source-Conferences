	00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:11,190
okay uh good afternoon everyone hope you

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:12,929
had a great lunch so today we are going

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,610
to talk on an important like now an

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,770
interesting topic actually are an

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,510
opportunity for like enough oil in we

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,730
talked about two faces of the same press

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,529
a ma / tunity and this one reason like

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,289
now both of us are standing here to talk

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:27,869
about how we can bring in students to

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,539
Apache projects so we are going to cover

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,820
the aspects of like a from the student

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,500
angle from the academic angle and also

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,690
from the patchy fog project point of

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,940
view so I am suresh module I'm from

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,460
Indiana University like I'm also with

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,770
economic by academic as a sign of the

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,390
the opportunity here but i will

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,860
presenting more on the fng projects

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,930
point of view from a quality management

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,489
committee point of view how do we want

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,620
like know how do we want a game in the

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,410
student want to be expect from the

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,660
students and so on and I'm Shahani vo

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,210
varna and I'm from you know the

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,910
University of Muratore in sri lanka and

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,080
i will be talking from the students

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:09,030
point of view are from the academic

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,470
point of view yeah so again yeah if you

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,119
don't want to run through some slides

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,530
but basically like I have a good

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,330
discussion on and some constructive

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,580
action items what we can do and how we

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,350
can bring in engage students with Apache

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,450
project so feel free to interrupt or any

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,600
time and want to like do it more like a

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,640
discussion forum here so the first one

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,799
is like now Ronnie nice reminder it as

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,950
like of the morning's keynote here is a

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,530
topic here like an SF is special and the

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,180
Apache brain trust is unparalleled so

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,100
here like know what do we care a good

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,689
take-home point from this keynote guy

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,790
from this for a statement if you can see

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,980
it yes the brain trust has been son

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,480
pilot and we have a lot

00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,610
they said how do we broaden this laughs

00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,110
how do we expand this how do we take it

00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:50,930
to the students and how do we even

00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:53,240
broader bringing more fresh brain to us

00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:57,200
to transport students all around the

00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:59,120
world yeah so the first like you guys

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,250
will like to focus on the talk

00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,080
specifically on like the new like and

00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,300
your aspects the new students academic

00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,240
aspect but before we go into details we

00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,100
just covered like no cough efforts in

00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,450
the areas like in a work like and hope

00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,700
they have been engaging students

00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:15,680
especially so the first one has been

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,530
it's called stem prime it's been a

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,300
really really new effort but it's being

00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,970
like we're taking of really nicely been

00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,710
helping basically various students to

00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,450
engage in the science technology and

00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,130
engineering and mathematics screen here

00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,800
like basically the stem freak effort

00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:34,160
what it does is it has a lot of mentors

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,080
and projects and then advisors and then

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,790
basically the students apply students

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,800
from various all around the world apply

00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,660
saying that I want to go to a particular

00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,520
conference in this area I want to learn

00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,980
have an undergraduate student create

00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,709
high school and say how long the

00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:51,350
governed get exposed but many times we

00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:53,870
get limited with this travel funding so

00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,910
how do we do that so the whole stem prac

00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,950
has a donation donor based mainly give

00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,810
the donated donations to help out with

00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:02,390
this student and the stem try to reduce

00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,090
them and then like now I discussed it

00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,380
more on the paid forward aspect but

00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,310
basically I have a bank of all the

00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,080
conferences and interesting ideas and

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,550
and then like Maya do the matchmaking

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,459
with the students and then send them to

00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:16,590
various conferences I can talk a little

00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:19,170
more detail offline also unlike know how

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,510
this has been successful and so on but

00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,190
you an interesting topic like now

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,840
interesting idea i like the what the

00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,760
stems nuthatch is called paid

00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,980
forward the students get two different

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,540
they go travel but now what do you do

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,010
what do you do give that like the

00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,870
students are encouraged to go back to

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,209
their community share their learning

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,709
this travels are expensive and even all

00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:38,970
the federal funding can especially in

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:40,709
the US universities Marshall he is

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,299
saying is we have see a huge cut in this

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:43,950
time with funding but the student get

00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,590
this opportunity how do we scale that so

00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,970
the students are encouraged to go back

00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,290
contribute right five people supported

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,120
what they are learnt about a particular

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,080
like meeting what they've learnt or a

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,310
particular conference and also like a

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,099
volunteer volunteer to become a mentor

00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:01,019
for the future students and so on so if

00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:02,849
you know this again like a simpler case

00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:04,620
focus on the throttle aspects but I now

00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:06,780
if you look back like another google

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,980
Summer of Code like now I'm sure like

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,390
many of you have been involved with

00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,570
google Summer of Code do we have any

00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:14,549
students who participated in g-shock

00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:18,269
have you I'm sure like any mentors who

00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:21,359
participated in G sharp ok so basically

00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:23,460
like it also their skin too much detail

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,140
but ways it and we have no idea what

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,180
ministered the G sub program I'd like

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:31,080
the first heard it in the patchy from a

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,880
while now so Google like a nice day John

00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,470
Wesley is conducting this program and

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,000
then it's a grating ways college

00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,610
students to participate in open source

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,860
software development so this is being

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:43,260
very interesting opportunities for the

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,580
students and especially young developers

00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,190
are teaching them how to engage with

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,320
open source project and no importantly

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,660
they get paid the student get paid to do

00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,610
that and also like they contribute to

00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,800
this real world software development and

00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,350
more importantly learn the open-source

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,120
culture my cry from early on white from

00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,130
the economic culture like no they are

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,139
learning like know how to contribute to

00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,389
open source like how

00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:10,789
to work with others and a lot of various

00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:13,219
aspects so important aspect here is the

00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:15,169
to have the g-shock quite enormous has

00:05:13,219 --> 00:05:17,120
been very global in nature they've been

00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:19,129
engaging both the students and projects

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,569
worldwide will not go into too many

00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:23,120
details here but an interesting aspect

00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:26,479
if you see is the number of countries

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,699
right now in 2012's 69 of them and will

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,199
be like wearing but mainly like no way

00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,279
many different countries are

00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:36,650
participating in it many different

00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:38,719
universities and so on so on and if you

00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:42,039
consider the top schools as you can see

00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:46,370
the very first up there with 164 as

00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:48,319
number of students from 2005 to 2012 is

00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,090
University of Naruto in Sri Lanka and

00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:53,599
that's the university I'm affiliated

00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:56,360
with and hence my interest in this

00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:58,969
because we understand how far this can

00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,580
be taken and how many opportunities can

00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:05,180
be created Sri Lanka being a developing

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:10,370
country still lead managed to do this so

00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:12,319
there is a lot of potential so if you

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,819
look back leg again like talking on the

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,379
two sides of even from the even of

00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:17,449
energy sub-project points front of you

00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:19,750
so the projects we see like now we are

00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:21,949
getting the project get paid developer

00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:24,110
computing and coming to a developer

00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:25,610
because they are graded and then like

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,319
now they have to pass the midterm

00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,029
evaluation the final grade so they are

00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:31,129
supposed to their you want the code to

00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:34,159
pass then get the internship so the

00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:35,870
project is getting some nice payday or a

00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:38,120
person also more importantly they are

00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,649
getting fresh ideas new ideas and also

00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,560
attracting new members of the project

00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:45,169
mocha community here and from the

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,659
student perspective it obviously is an

00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:49,819
opportunity to gain a real world

00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:51,710
experience in software development and

00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:54,100
in particular open source software

00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,660
development and then we all know

00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,970
I mean by open source software

00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,280
development it's it's just not purely

00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:02,650
cutting cord you know you had work in a

00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:05,920
community you have to collaborate you

00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:09,340
have to you know communicate via email

00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,800
and that forces students whose first

00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,200
language is not English to you know

00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,970
improve their writing skills and you

00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,250
know communication skills so there are

00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:21,850
lots of things that they learn just from

00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:25,650
these three months and of course you

00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:28,150
know one big incentive is the payment

00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,980
you know for three months the amount

00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:33,850
that google pays it means a lot

00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:37,540
especially very translated to you know a

00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:41,860
different country with a different level

00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:44,830
of economics and you know the ability to

00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,870
network it's all about exposure student

00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:49,510
and undergraduate student or a graduate

00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:52,570
student from another country gets an

00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:55,480
opportunity to get exposed to a far

00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:57,580
larger community and in it but yet

00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,640
within a structured setting you're right

00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:05,200
it's not like wide open but they still

00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:07,090
the first kind of communicate and

00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,480
therefore network retirees and they

00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:12,520
become more and for them it's something

00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,740
you know very valuable so it's only

00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:19,930
three months but they achieve a lot in

00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:21,730
that three months so if you look back in

00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,410
statistics again like you know the

00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:25,720
number of students as you can see from

00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:28,510
the start of the program has increased

00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,160
but lately like you know has kind of

00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,570
stabilized around like a thousand but

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,680
more importantly like if you see like a

00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,240
case the Google kind of I think

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,800
officially published on that website

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,750
they're trying to keep both the

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,219
organizations and students conscious now

00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,930
both for funding and also the

00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:42,219
manageability of the program they're

00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:45,580
trying to keep it on two thousand twelve

00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:47,110
hundred now if you see there's yeah of

00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,840
course right now free appreciation to

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,570
google and

00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,190
but there certainly demonstrated a nice

00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,020
concept here and how students can

00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,150
benefit and all but how do we take it

00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,770
like that we need to scale as we

00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,390
increasingly seem like from one more

00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,160
students and crazy in itself is a

00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,870
worldwide one wide we are also we are

00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,030
talking about 1200 students for one

00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,320
summer program but lots of students

00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:08,600
would like to take the benefit of this

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,230
and it basically helping their careers

00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,000
helping the one new software so that's

00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:16,010
kind of on some of the idea like if you

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,810
want to discuss but just so before that

00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:23,810
like not looking further into some more

00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:25,370
d sock if you can see like you know the

00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,110
juice of students have done suddenly

00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,850
done well they have done their project

00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,980
never passed and there are some very

00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,570
good success stories actually also some

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,120
g sub students especially in Apache

00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:36,530
getting through the wire going beyond

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,020
the committee of shape beyond their

00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:40,520
project earning competition project and

00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,380
even like that examples of become

00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,520
members of the foundation so they're

00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,410
become computed members of this

00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,480
foundation and but that has not been a

00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,460
constant like they've been like no

00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,010
spikes here and there but largely if you

00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,350
see that we used to do that poets and go

00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,610
back so before let me look at this

00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:57,470
against like here we have a lot of

00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,300
improvement and a lot of states we can

00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,700
do from the p.m. six point of view

00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,960
between Android the next year Google

00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,090
some more for is right there on the

00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,850
corner so from the projects we can think

00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:09,650
about what do we what do we do beyond

00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,090
just like executing the formality of G

00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,700
sharp like we need to teach them up

00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:15,260
front firstly is I guess most of the

00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,820
TMC's might reflect there's that the

00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,820
students who've been successful having

00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:21,810
her you know on white instead of jumping

00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,490
off to the proposal if they ignore

00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:25,140
very well at least and even for the

00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,660
project point of view I provide

00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,890
tutorials and some basic documentation

00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,279
they come and learn and get familiar

00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:34,770
before they start that project and the

00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:36,240
doing this kind of smaller step will

00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,610
keep them you're welcome getting that

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,140
okay yeah I'm taken more seriously and

00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,790
then they are given more projects and

00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,010
then they're even their contributions

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,510
are appreciated and welcomed them when

00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,250
they are merged back into the same code

00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:50,760
the coolest will now get more committed

00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:52,110
they get motivated so so why I guess

00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,730
like some improvements you can take it

00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,950
even from the G sub point of view from

00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,360
Apache we have about 40 predicted

00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:05,130
clarify the numbers but they kind of

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:07,050
around 40 40 40 45 another 24 we have so

00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,550
this project like no we need to keep by

00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,230
now we need to go back to strategies and

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,940
see how many of these 44 students now

00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,860
working with various Apache projects are

00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,930
being treated as pmc members are getting

00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,310
interested where we should constrictive

00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,440
I guess from the projects point of you

00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:21,390
try to see how we can improve and it

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,670
like a wave seem like an against us of

00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:26,190
that success so I cannot share out the

00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,810
project have seen an example again it is

00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,330
not only the key success but like

00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:32,130
general observation has been in students

00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,050
do projects which are cross-cutting

00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,120
which cross across Apache project they

00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,700
get more welcome they create like you

00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,130
know

00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,870
more confusion to like know who is

00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,950
actually mentoring like how are they

00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:44,020
getting engaged with the both the

00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:46,150
communities it is an integration project

00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,430
or its are they doing Delma or they are

00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:50,170
using one project in order but this was

00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,450
wrong a yield then more important even

00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:54,550
the projects do not have time to look at

00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,590
it for instance like you know be another

00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,450
example have been in Iowa and over 80

00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,860
projects we know there is not of

00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:01,810
synergies we've been trying to look

00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,670
between the both the Bothan author

00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:05,620
community and the ODT community has been

00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,970
looking at it but these d subject

00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,470
projects are a good opportunity the

00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,600
students come from a fresh height

00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:13,420
between them and link between this

00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,330
project so going on to the specific

00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,590
example from the student Melinda did it

00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:20,140
I know what the project like an

00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:21,550
integrated I Roberta with a factually

00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,470
where and talking to a party hydro

00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,930
approve so we kind of what cross-linked

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:28,990
dead so what would feel an interesting

00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:30,760
story here is he just like no he used to

00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,870
do his project but he quickly realized

00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,790
when he is doing this kind of

00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,260
integration of this project the

00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,000
fundamental architecture needs to be

00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,400
provided like we need to be enhanced to

00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,560
do this integration so the student

00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,390
continue to contribute and then say how

00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,070
can I make this like the core i love the

00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:47,650
architecture it's simple and extendable

00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,930
and like anger you the community up here

00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:51,700
is some my ideas like beyond my project

00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,340
like now because my solutions micrantha

00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,810
even the freshman committee was very

00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,700
receptive and then they welcome the idea

00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:00,190
and now they are back with remain from

00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,290
code base and like no these are like i'm

00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,940
not going to detail but like not just

00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,250
illustrating from a very high level

00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,440
perspective these are like not the fine

00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,240
extension the students have done not

00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,310
just part of infinities project but made

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,320
way for lots of future extensions for

00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:18,720
the project itself or future dicen of

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,890
projects to be executed and so on so

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,840
that's kind of the one of story but i

00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:24,400
hope to see like no more and more such

00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,340
like no stories where students get

00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:30,140
engage the pmc in apache but also reckon

00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:33,170
on Iran ODT we have written out going

00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:36,590
we already saw project as well yeah and

00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:39,500
so dear for the I Rebecca project we

00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:41,540
took a step you know g-shock has been

00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:44,720
successful but we were wondering how we

00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:46,640
could engage more students who didn't

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,400
fall into the g-shock time I would

00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:52,430
didn't you know submitted by the

00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:54,020
deadline and so many other issues so

00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:57,380
that's when we started thinking about

00:13:54,020 --> 00:14:01,190
student research projects based on hi

00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:03,500
Rebecca so we tried this out at the

00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:05,930
University of naruto first leap he said

00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:08,510
you try out some masters level research

00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:11,120
projects what we did was we had an

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:13,280
initial brainstorming session to come up

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,350
with the you know rough five years we

00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,840
wanted to make sure the idea wasn't to

00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:20,330
detail because the students creativity

00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:23,890
had to come in very much like the g

00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:26,780
soccer thing but these ideas had to be

00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:29,510
rich enough that the student could do a

00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:33,740
research project ranging from like one

00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:36,170
to two years that was for that purpose

00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:39,050
it is not a you know we took Apache

00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:41,870
irobot Apache rail or patch over DT and

00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:44,900
we started brainstorming some ideas and

00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:47,450
then the documented the ideas in our

00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:50,600
first round I think we had about five

00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:52,910
ideas that we put together in each idea

00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:57,170
had a very short description just a few

00:14:52,910 --> 00:15:00,170
sentences and what we did was then we

00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:03,710
published it to the MSC students master

00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:05,600
students say it's you know the students

00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:08,180
then have the option of selecting if

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:12,580
they want to so out of the five ideas

00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:15,980
three students selected three ideas and

00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:17,930
what's the notable difference between

00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,570
this approach with the g-shock

00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:25,100
approaches of course the length of time

00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:28,040
right the engage with the student for 11

00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:30,910
or more years right we hope they could

00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:36,980
be less than two

00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:41,210
MSC and the other difference is that the

00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:43,970
student is now engaged with the project

00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:45,770
not from a perspective of being a pet

00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:48,890
software developers for a short period

00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:52,640
of time instead the students motivation

00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:56,120
is that they are doing some academic

00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:59,410
research which will lead to that MSC

00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:02,899
right so in that context now they're

00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:04,459
that connected with academic institution

00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:07,540
in this case the university or naruto

00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:10,520
and the university of malta has its own

00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:15,160
deadlines it has its own milestones that

00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:18,140
the student has to satisfy right so the

00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,320
MSC program at the University defines

00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:23,089
those deadlines and the milestones such

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,980
as you know you have to submit your

00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:26,959
research proposal by this day you have

00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:30,620
to do a literature review report by this

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:32,390
day now a typical student engagement

00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,610
with an open source project will not

00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:37,160
involve those things right but in this

00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:39,740
case this is additional learning for the

00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,839
student and it is since it's aligned

00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:43,880
with what they're supposed to do in the

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,430
university and since the project is

00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:50,779
willing to allow the students to go

00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:53,600
along with that it's a win-win and the

00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:57,260
other aspect is in each of these

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,330
students has a local supervisor so the

00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:02,060
local supervisor in this case was myself

00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:04,939
because I was back in Sri Lanka and I

00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:07,490
acted as their local supervisor I am

00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:10,130
acting as their local supervisor but the

00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:13,929
student also has melters the mentors are

00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:18,800
the mentors from the open source project

00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:26,490
excavation Chris madman from the ODT Raj

00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:29,520
oh hi sir said that's how it works and

00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:32,070
that was her that was a one thing we

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:37,010
tried it so far it has been very

00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:39,870
successful right but we also had a

00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:42,210
project which was not entirely

00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,309
successful and we also try to reflect

00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:47,040
back and self try to figure out why he

00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:48,570
pauses successful so yeah so the idea is

00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,130
nothing against this to end product we

00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,260
are talking about an technologies vary

00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,510
from various from like undergraduate to

00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,400
masters to capstone so they vary by

00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:58,290
nature but also by the student team and

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,480
so on but what we learned actually at

00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,770
least here in this case was this is a

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,720
failure when you when students are

00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:05,550
executing these fairly substantial they

00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,320
are not always the success not being

00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,120
like sometimes code but sometimes make

00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,309
it could be measured as the student

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,840
learning who can serve but any case but

00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:14,940
more importantly what we hear you are

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,740
seen as the students are working on the

00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,480
economic economic going through the

00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,610
rectum excite wheel passing their grades

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,710
and so on they should be like an array

00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,570
should be a bridge where they often get

00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,920
overwhelmed between Oh what happens in

00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,500
the open source community between what

00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,870
they are being taught an economic one so

00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,910
an important lesson here is the take

00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,700
home one is the local aspects of it like

00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:37,890
have is more a committed member from the

00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,750
faculty or someone who at least you may

00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:41,370
not like to know need to know the

00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,800
project but at least needs to know the

00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,480
engine of this work and keys bridge that

00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,770
all this you need to go back and engage

00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,900
with the community are you doing the

00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:50,670
communication than my English find again

00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,960
at least tell them and then three are

00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:54,030
you talking to the momentum in the

00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,400
Patrick project and so on I mean it's

00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:58,770
very important for us to understand that

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,900
the students especially if they are from

00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:03,540
a different country a different culture

00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:06,480
and so are they are not familiar with

00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:09,750
you know what it entails what's in

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,910
telling you know networking and so on so

00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,920
they really initially need some

00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:16,050
hand-holding and if they are not

00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:19,140
performing I they are not communicating

00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:21,270
as they should there should be given a

00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:24,120
gentle nudge and in you know the

00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:25,920
community the PMC the committee's the

00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,929
dev these people are not going to come

00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,630
to the student and say look we are not

00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:30,490
hearing from

00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:32,650
you so there has to be somebody who

00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:35,500
nurtures the student because in this

00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:38,500
case remember the student is not being

00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:43,380
paired to do this it is almost you know

00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:43,380
about doing it as part of the academic

00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:49,270
part of what they do in the academic

00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:52,870
context so therefore that more color

00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:55,450
person providing the guidance to the

00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:59,110
student being figured was the issue so

00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:01,810
here in this mad cat project when we

00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:04,900
reflect a back we realize that in that

00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:08,950
particular project although there was a

00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:12,430
mentoring stranqer there was no local

00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:14,530
supervisor within the university who was

00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,970
familiar with this whole process and

00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:18,040
could guide the students like that and

00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:23,740
that is what caused that kind of drop

00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:25,690
out yes so the basic idea coming back to

00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,310
the marina an open discussion forum i

00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,810
guess like nowhere with this convex

00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,400
basically here like what you want to

00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,870
discuss is like know what for everyone's

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,610
thoughts are both on the project

00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:35,950
management point of view or from the

00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:38,440
student how do we engage is because this

00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:40,390
cut certainly the monster it's lacking

00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,830
on both the G sub projects and the stem

00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:44,320
track and all these academic projects

00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:46,360
demonstrate like students car going to

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,160
benefit a lot like both from this and

00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,290
also so how do we take these next steps

00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,640
and more importantly even if you take

00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,080
the air means they are like a lot of

00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,960
things we can improve of course we need

00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:58,060
all of the thing needs volunteers the

00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,309
Apache especially knowing and we and

00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,409
others have been grading

00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:03,690
administering the program but still not

00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:05,490
spill overwhelming for the student if

00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:06,539
you come down to the Apache especially

00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:09,360
they go to the giro and they are

00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:11,340
pointing to this like various 6070 Gina

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,659
issues they need to go figure out like

00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,059
they are not self explore it when you

00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:17,789
say oh I hear out of this over details

00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:19,080
or do this but even like how we can do

00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:20,820
certain things like know how do we link

00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,289
the groupwise when someone is coming and

00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,690
say yeah i'm looking for a java project

00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:26,370
do we have one what is where do i go i'm

00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:28,200
looking for like no doing something epic

00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:30,509
data technology i want to do something

00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,610
in a web space we do i do I think like

00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:34,619
no that's one of the I think like you're

00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:36,480
missing or like improvement like

00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:38,940
lubricant so with little effort we can

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,249
do more importantly maybe a but maybe

00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:44,100
Teager maybe a place or better see a CMS

00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:45,779
and so on that's on the countryside with

00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,820
the g-shock side effect but it is this

00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:49,879
the motive of projects and now all like

00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:52,049
certainly have clear like a

00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:53,580
demonstrating that even now like we can

00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:55,619
take it more further like novia the

00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:58,409
g-shock feel good you are rounded to

00:21:55,619 --> 00:22:00,419
begin 40 / but we have like now close to

00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:02,610
150 projects like livin like the doesn't

00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:04,529
even scale like 13 project get a PMC

00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:08,490
member from g-shock and so on so but

00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:10,619
lots of research ideas even though we

00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,820
are the software communities are the

00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:13,440
stewards can come figure out the

00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:15,629
research aspects in society in those

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,669
projects and then they can go back and

00:22:15,629 --> 00:22:19,679
then do i do the economic research

00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:22,529
projects based on them so benefiting

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,830
both project in the student so so this

00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:27,149
kind of thought again like this not just

00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:28,860
thought to start with right now we want

00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:32,279
to take it more complex tab button also

00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:35,549
feel free to come in and then interject

00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:38,249
here so yeah what is so basically what

00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:40,919
we are proposing is and we would like to

00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:44,070
hear your feedback on this is like a

00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:47,429
research project idea bank right once

00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:50,100
again it's just a few lines so that then

00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:51,720
the student can expand upon it but it is

00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,760
like the emission

00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,110
you know guidance to the student and

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,960
then the student would figure out

00:22:55,110 --> 00:23:01,760
whether it's something that interests

00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:04,350
them and these research ideas should be

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,600
significant enough so that it would be

00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:09,240
sufficient for a capstone project or

00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,850
undergraduate group project that goes on

00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,710
for at least six months or graduate

00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,960
student research project that goes on

00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:18,900
for one to two years it has to be of

00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,659
that nature and of course it's not just

00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:24,809
about the idea bank we also need a

00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:27,000
framework to support this whole thing in

00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:30,169
it has to because the framework has to

00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,539
create win-win scenarios for both the

00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:37,230
PNC members as well as the students so

00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:39,539
just some thoughts here is and it should

00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:41,760
be such that we harness the students

00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:43,710
skills and interests and I just

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:47,100
mentioned it that you have to make the

00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:49,500
project work relevant and require from

00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,780
by aligning with the academic kind of

00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,690
curriculum so the PMC members have to

00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:57,480
understand that these research projects

00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:59,159
students will go up and they will go and

00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,039
do the research they will communicate

00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:03,990
with the courage with the community but

00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:06,120
they have their own milestones and

00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:08,370
deadlines to me so there will be doing

00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:11,940
significant literature reviews and so on

00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:14,880
and then we would encourage them to

00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:16,890
share it with the community but it's

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,950
kind of different from what normally

00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:22,409
happens in the community but it's still

00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:25,500
you know it's tendrils as everybody's

00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:27,630
knowledge as a design and there is also

00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,880
a sense of satisfaction and we had work

00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:32,100
create a sense of satisfaction and a

00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,350
sense of achievement for the students by

00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:36,570
encouraging research publications

00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:38,970
presentations at Apache Khan and similar

00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:41,400
conferences giving them committed ship

00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:44,400
if they are sufficiently engaged and so

00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:46,440
on so these are things that the PMC

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,150
members or the people who give the ideas

00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,330
into the idea bank they have to keep

00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:55,740
this in mind you know we have to make

00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:57,270
sure the student feels good yeah so I

00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,660
think more important I think you can

00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,250
take

00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:01,080
the thoughts from the previous talk

00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:03,870
delegate delegate like a boss no

00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,670
community because I think I think those

00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:07,050
are some Lykke spoiler points like no

00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,870
for this kind of engagements in the

00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:12,060
sense give it give them the school step

00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:13,650
back let them like to see what it is and

00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:16,020
then like no step in and then do them

00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:17,430
but like you know so that's interested

00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:19,950
because that's kind of more needed

00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:21,690
because from the principal's quite you

00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:23,790
like no they they they take up a nice

00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:26,010
idea and then say hey I don't know time

00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:27,540
but is a nice wish list maybe avoid it

00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:28,890
could work with no security device like

00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,570
the obvious like many products we'll

00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,920
look you look it up and then say what

00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:34,110
are the issue is what do we need to do

00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,700
all that no I need to load balance scale

00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:36,690
this thing like know whatever the issue

00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,000
is like you know some of those

00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:41,220
fundamental aspects but even to know or

00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,320
even more groundbreaking technology

00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:45,450
color advancement take it they should

00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,670
learn to like put on like you're writing

00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:49,530
code also take some effort put this idea

00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:51,000
how just enough to see they get picked

00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:53,130
up and if the students are getting

00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,720
engaged you're interested like no help

00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:56,370
them fresh off a flipped out a little

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,190
more oh maybe you could look at this

00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:01,860
more work with it more and even the

00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:04,140
student now they get they get back also

00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:06,840
make know if you look back the students

00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:08,400
are getting along with the satisfaction

00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,900
all the PMC members are also getting

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,280
maybe like they're not

00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,350
working with the student publisher of

00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,660
sex like now sometimes is a good for

00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:17,340
everyone to try to fight people or

00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:19,620
sometimes even more a conference papers

00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:21,840
and so on and also even present those as

00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:24,060
a standalone projects too but you're

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,100
also more importantly like the Apache

00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:28,260
where I allow the example go back like

00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:32,490
now they come back to the mainstream and

00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:34,140
strong so again like the projects has to

00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:36,030
be idea i think they are from varying

00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,320
lens because various countries we are

00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:39,870
talking about making broad range of

00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,340
academic curriculum here with various

00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,660
again broad range of students so they

00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:46,170
could be of varying length weighing

00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:47,700
expertise and also they could be like a

00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:49,680
little bit software project but what

00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,730
motivates released from more experienced

00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,260
what we have seen is they have to

00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:54,090
believe more research is oriented nice

00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,620
fluid should have some kind of an

00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:59,970
expiratory gas they should go by

00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:03,150
themself and back yeah in fact what was

00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:06,890
typical with other you know in our

00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:09,540
experiences initially and the students

00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:13,260
posted on the devilish question such as

00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:15,600
can you guide me towards some papers on

00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,580
this topic now that is not the typical

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,180
kind of question you would get on the

00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:22,920
dev list but because the PMC members

00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:24,870
knew that these students are doing this

00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:27,630
they were very welcoming and discharged

00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:29,430
you know potential publications that

00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:32,040
would be useful for the students and so

00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:34,560
on yes along with like in all the

00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,270
research aspect as well also for the

00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,920
pmcs

00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:38,930
along with all the community engagement

00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,790
all they do with their also teaching

00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:43,100
mobile so fragmovie for the stocks are

00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:44,900
Apache at all along with the 11

00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,340
educational aspect in education sense of

00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,620
satisfaction for all the project members

00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:49,940
like no matter how we can do this and

00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,500
how we are trading a training the next

00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:56,450
generation workforce especially in this

00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:58,640
night technological areas yeah and of

00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:01,370
course based on our experiences we

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,280
already know a potential best practice

00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:06,880
that is the importance of having a local

00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:09,080
advice or supervisor from the academic

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:14,510
institution that the student is attached

00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:17,210
to because the PMC mentors don't have

00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:19,100
the time to you know be guiding the

00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:21,920
student through the learning curve and

00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:24,350
so on you know having a local supervisor

00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:26,990
advisor eliminates that responsibility

00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:28,910
from the PMC mmm and mentors and it

00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:32,030
makes us to them more comfortable as

00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:34,850
well and also the local supervisor would

00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:37,640
then and ensure that the student adheres

00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:40,400
to their milestones and deadlines and so

00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:42,110
on and if you look from the point of

00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,000
view of the local surprises so why

00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:45,860
should a local what could motivate the

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,680
local supervisor what's a win-win for

00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:51,890
them right and once again it's enhanced

00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,750
research collaboration until the Swedish

00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:58,480
pointed out there that was Sir Chris

00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:58,480
madman over there I have not met

00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:09,070
shiny yeah so we see each other no but

00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:12,910
you know a student has been credited

00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:15,309
with you and me please that's just how

00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:17,550
it goes and of course the research

00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:23,340
publication so there is a win win win

00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:23,340
all around if we could kind of do this

00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:29,500
so again like a leave it open for more

00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:31,450
thoughts on like no interest and how

00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:34,090
much most importantly like now to hear

00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:36,220
from more project PMC's here to see like

00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:38,830
now what kind of value org and 10 ideas

00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:41,170
we can do is but the general idea

00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:43,030
against like we can build upon what we

00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:44,350
had already success in SF from the

00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:47,050
g-shock perspective like no more

00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:49,120
importantly do a little more job with

00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:52,150
the PMC's because with a long way off on

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,980
to document our ideas like document or

00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:57,130
like the potential new ideas for someone

00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:58,809
to scratch it katsu more so basically in

00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:01,390
short like reading such bank on

00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:03,340
technology can figure out when you may

00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:05,200
be a community dollar become deaf p.m.

00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,630
see in the venue or we could take it up

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,830
and then take it from there or and also

00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,350
figured out at least place especially

00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:13,750
ignore it from early on even i was a

00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:15,880
little bit skeptical on will the local

00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:17,800
supervisors be motivated and so on but

00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,360
even like you know recently going back

00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,340
and oscar shiny is coming back with a

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,410
lot of experience where he at the grass

00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,700
root in the shower this little top and

00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:25,990
even like now is trying to give these

00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,690
talks in india or to various united

00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:30,429
states how do we do if you guys women's

00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:31,900
i was trying to basically project these

00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:33,940
are the apache projects you guys going

00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,710
to want to start engaging from now on

00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,750
the way that liquid made before your g

00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,850
shock starts from doing that the

00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:41,590
response i have seen in especially the

00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:42,119
university face they are more than

00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,889
welcome

00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:45,689
the u.s. disinterestedly just not only

00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:47,279
the students are finding a volunteers

00:30:45,689 --> 00:30:49,199
the institutions are interested because

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,789
they want to get the opportunities for

00:30:49,199 --> 00:30:52,259
their students to go on and now

00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:53,639
obviously the institution especially you

00:30:52,259 --> 00:30:55,019
can fix like India where you have an

00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:56,309
overwhelming number of engineering

00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:58,229
schools and overwhelming number of

00:30:56,309 --> 00:30:59,669
students coming of them they want the

00:30:58,229 --> 00:31:02,309
screens to be standing out the steward

00:30:59,669 --> 00:31:04,499
stand out so they want to look out like

00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:06,179
all of this like an especially and the

00:31:04,499 --> 00:31:08,549
Apache of course with the brand and all

00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:11,159
it still takes it off like Apache

00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:13,319
committers were themselves like no like

00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:15,179
a track with Reuters epic time so this

00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:18,329
lecture that what the email streets like

00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:19,799
the students like head so it is what we

00:31:18,329 --> 00:31:21,899
have seen is like you know certainly

00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:24,839
raise a lot of interest around it just

00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:27,059
like no we need to some more one clear

00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:29,159
thing and also it's not going to be like

00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:31,649
happen just like that yeah keep talking

00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:33,239
the PFCs also have to do that I can't

00:31:31,649 --> 00:31:34,829
figure out the model like number to be

00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:37,409
engaged how do they expire if I more

00:31:34,829 --> 00:31:41,219
documentation of course the introduction

00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:43,289
to door and stuff I mean these are

00:31:41,219 --> 00:31:45,779
things to be figured out this is a very

00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:48,719
you know we need to discuss and see you

00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:50,489
know exactly what and there will be you

00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:52,709
know we will try something or maybe it

00:31:50,489 --> 00:31:54,809
won't work but we have to figure out

00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:57,809
what is the engagement model because you

00:31:54,809 --> 00:32:00,449
know with the local supervisor with the

00:31:57,809 --> 00:32:02,819
students what will work because this is

00:32:00,449 --> 00:32:06,359
not Jesus this is not short term this is

00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:10,079
not paired this is the academic research

00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:12,839
how can we facilitate it from an ASM

00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:15,149
pointer standpoint base this is untapped

00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:18,839
potential and we really need to do

00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:21,899
something about it yeah so again like

00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:24,060
how well like this at this point like

00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:25,740
nah we've been discussing more obviously

00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:27,360
is your experiences how we can take it

00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:29,850
from there but i guess like it's a good

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,050
one will be to watch the community or

00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:32,520
mailing list and that product

00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:35,130
description and see if we can take out

00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:38,430
and get more reporters but so he has

00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:41,040
precisely any specific solutions of

00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:42,720
goals or anything like now open it up to

00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,030
discussion items and see how like know

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,040
all or what's up this experience has

00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:55,860
been in this area like no engaging with

00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:58,850
students and so on I'd see pathway that

00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:03,060
was a mentor for google summer of code

00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:06,290
2012 for the Apache service project

00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:10,890
about the example project and the

00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:13,830
student was a undergraduate and they in

00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:18,980
Brazil we had a good time one thing that

00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:22,680
kept him motivated was offering the

00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:26,750
necessary research papers and guidance

00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:30,660
to so that he had the necessary

00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:34,160
background to be productive in his

00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:38,250
project with open source without

00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:41,610
providing him the necessary background

00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:44,640
in what a time continuum whom was what a

00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:47,670
calendar calendar was and the various

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,299
types of calendar systems and the

00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:53,970
specification of

00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:57,460
I'm infrastructures as defined in the w3

00:33:53,970 --> 00:34:00,570
schema specs you would not have been

00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:03,759
proficient in his research but he

00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:10,109
accomplished well his product is being

00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:13,179
integrated into the zalman project and

00:34:10,109 --> 00:34:17,290
looks like a lot we will be incorporated

00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:22,210
into the next release I am also a mentor

00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:25,569
at Oregon State University outside of

00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:29,040
the Apache projects the students there

00:34:25,569 --> 00:34:33,040
the computer science are very very

00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:37,960
enthusiastic anything open-source they

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:40,629
want to absorb like a sponge they want

00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:43,270
to be able to participate they have

00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:46,690
their own projects one of the things

00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:51,010
that I'm trying to do is to help

00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:53,260
identify to their project leaders and

00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:56,889
managers and administrators in the

00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:59,890
university the open source tools that

00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:02,589
are available that to help them with

00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:05,520
their research projects they could be a

00:35:02,589 --> 00:35:11,740
patchy open source tools they could be

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:16,200
that open SQL for security libraries etc

00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:19,720
but anything that you could share with

00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,400
improves their enthusiasm for getting

00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:25,390
involved in the open source community

00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:26,680
and it also that helps the instructors

00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:29,310
know what the

00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:31,480
open source and apache way is all about

00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:34,270
thank you very much do I think like no

00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,800
that's very very greedy to hear those

00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:37,630
kind of stories and especially like

00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,750
another potential of it and I guess like

00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:42,490
this in our experience as well so yeah I

00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:44,020
think like maybe time permitting we

00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:47,920
should discuss more go back and more

00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:49,660
discuss more of the US yeah so I think a

00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,980
challenge might have is I don't think

00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,990
anybody is involved in any of the

00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:54,550
projects would disagree with the value

00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:57,190
of everything from proving the

00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:58,870
documentation to being a GOC mentor I

00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:01,330
think you're proposing those specific

00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:03,820
project to work on and in a way it's

00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:05,770
almost a creation of a new sub community

00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:07,450
with an Apache that would take kind of

00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:09,490
long-term ownership over a couple of

00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:13,270
interesting things to main feels a bit

00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:15,730
like the the PR community or the

00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:17,560
infrastructure community which we've

00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:19,210
organized as kind of their own projects

00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,040
right they have their own mailing lists

00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,630
they have their dev lists and their

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,230
community public list you know they've

00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:28,210
got you know ways of operating that it

00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:29,860
established a good pattern and so one

00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:32,260
approach you may want to take is to

00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:35,710
consider proposing to the incubator a

00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:38,290
you know a big university project or an

00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:40,570
education project or something that is

00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:44,080
chartered with a certain mandate that

00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:46,330
has a set of initial people you know PMC

00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:48,390
members which would be the two of you it

00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:51,010
might be other people university or from

00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:52,660
other places that seem appropriate for

00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:54,790
this right or other volunteers from the

00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:57,550
rest of the asf but it's an identified

00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:59,440
list of eight people six people with 12

00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:01,600
whatever who take collective ownership

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,160
over it because I think the challenges

00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,910
you'll have a lot of volunteers come in

00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,040
and say this is great and then when it

00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:09,050
artwork you know attorney depend upon

00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,560
the nice thing when the pmsing structure

00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:14,060
is now yours a group publicly taking

00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:16,070
responsibility as a whole and I think

00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:17,990
that may be what this project needs to

00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:20,810
get over the hump the final thing might

00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:24,590
be there's something that's today called

00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:26,360
code.org which was Zuckerberg and Bill

00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:28,940
Clinton and Bill Gates and others saying

00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,620
you know we should teach programming in

00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,240
high schools all over the place I don't

00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:34,250
know how much funding they have but it's

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,320
a very slick website so it suggests that

00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:37,880
they got some coming this may be

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,190
something that if you put together a

00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,810
package of hood a really solid vision

00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:44,150
around you could pretty easily get

00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:47,000
funding for people to spend time purely

00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:48,650
on the development this as a program you

00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,090
know check not on each technologist

00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:52,070
still keeping the same kind of

00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:53,630
volunteerism hearts Apache with giving

00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:55,760
them the space and resources to do this

00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:58,480
that people are reported on google

00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,220
summer of code for example for example

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,320
denied yes to bricked up like one thing

00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:06,470
I want to check by Maurice Becker when

00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:08,270
you said incubator pmc know why but i

00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:10,820
guess like we're also getting better how

00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:13,490
does that integrated right a software

00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,870
and stuff so you'll be mainly suggesting

00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:16,460
that for a garden and smarter like

00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:19,070
mainly for this kind of this is a go

00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:22,400
this is about how does it organized as a

00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:23,480
project of the asf it's it's something

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,190
that entirely could happen within a

00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,050
community to catch you community gotta

00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:28,700
patch it up yet perhaps perhaps that's

00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:30,260
where it starts my thought was starting

00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,850
the incubator so you're not short

00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:34,190
circuiting into the ordinary process

00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:36,710
around how projects take off i-10 jet so

00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:39,320
that you can attract mentorship you know

00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:40,700
from other asf members but then

00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,960
eventually graduate to a full-fledged

00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,490
project you know when you have your

00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,710
first release you know or what in the

00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:48,830
criteria moving the story invader P&C

00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:50,300
would want to set down if any other

00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:53,740
people have thoughts on how governance

00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,740
might work there you go yeah

00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:02,160
yes

00:38:59,279 --> 00:39:06,329
yeah so I would be rad

00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:09,839
good idea ji-suk kind of lives within

00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:12,000
the content but it's had I'm gonna

00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:14,030
short-circuit Ava than that you know

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,770
whatever it typically people within that

00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:18,660
step up the new things which is great

00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:22,020
but it might make sense to exclusively

00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:24,180
call out this sort of you know some

00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:26,339
project related to universities for that

00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:28,650
because we do a lot of self-organizing

00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:31,859
in that realm on our own anyways by

00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:33,690
talking one another I i just got emails

00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:35,940
from these guys that was like oh they

00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:37,410
want to measure my student that I was

00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,059
interested in it because it was an itch

00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:41,309
I wanted to scratch within the projects

00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:44,849
I was well worth you know and I was like

00:39:41,309 --> 00:39:46,920
this is great because its students and I

00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:50,039
TJ go sc2 and I was like this is great

00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:52,109
you know and so so it's self organizing

00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:54,720
this maybe could be made more formal for

00:39:52,109 --> 00:39:56,970
your suggestion so the other comment

00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:00,049
that i have is there any reason that it

00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:04,609
should focus on ms students only or like

00:40:00,049 --> 00:40:08,039
you know I think no these projects could

00:40:04,609 --> 00:40:09,930
yes no no that's not what would that's

00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:11,849
survivable that it could be capstone

00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:15,000
project psycho undergraduate

00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:19,410
group project and messy projects PhD you

00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,930
know yeah yes yeah we're gonna have an

00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:23,520
answer from unison tomorrow Suresh

00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:26,289
autonomy and he's going to talk about

00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,609
some of their strategies for life

00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:35,799
going with things like this should be a

00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:44,469
core part of you know agencies so I have

00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:46,809
another point technique we should I said

00:40:44,469 --> 00:40:48,459
I also we know this yet so I had one

00:40:46,809 --> 00:40:50,469
question i don't know if it's this

00:40:48,459 --> 00:40:51,880
already but it seems like a great way to

00:40:50,469 --> 00:40:53,439
tap into these communities is to

00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:56,229
actually like generate for killing for

00:40:53,439 --> 00:40:58,419
those courses at university so something

00:40:56,229 --> 00:41:00,400
on bring them on search engines and that

00:40:58,419 --> 00:41:02,199
ties to soul or seen or anything else

00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,910
they're acting against the problems

00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:05,859
there then that would tie directly into

00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:08,319
these programs Thatcher you could ask

00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:09,759
the solar people what are the issues

00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:11,489
that are facing right now and that would

00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:14,079
generate interest around that class so

00:41:11,489 --> 00:41:16,329
yes I'm sorry okay Bob I know that

00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,099
people out I've already done this to

00:41:16,329 --> 00:41:23,289
kind of driving people their class back

00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:25,119
to turn that you yes yeah I think like

00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:26,739
yeah that's great idea i get us building

00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,239
a plug-in like what's that's this point

00:41:26,739 --> 00:41:30,339
adore you don't need to restrict thank

00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:32,019
you master for uganda craft or like they

00:41:30,339 --> 00:41:40,869
could grow weaker anticipations or

00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:42,939
sometimes is like for a while I was

00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:46,679
running google summer of code that is

00:41:42,939 --> 00:41:46,679
our code in cs5 72

00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,869
15 of my students that were just I was

00:41:50,589 --> 00:41:54,460
like hey you guys your final project if

00:41:52,869 --> 00:41:56,079
you want to contribute to the asf you

00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:58,030
know I had to do a guys see ladies and
