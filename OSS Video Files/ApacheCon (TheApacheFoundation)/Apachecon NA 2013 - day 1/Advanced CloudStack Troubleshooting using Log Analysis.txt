okay so my next step my current session

00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:06,359
here is advanced class stack

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:08,220
troubleshooting with log analysis again

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:09,570
my name is Christine ski I'm an

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,639
escalation engineer at citrix systems

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,920
and previously I was working at koat.com

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:16,379
as a same in the same job the support

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,880
engineer role so I've been working on

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,650
cloudstack supporting call stack for

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,029
about two years have a little bit of

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:25,830
experience of looking at these cloud

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:28,349
cycle logs so agenda we're going to be

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:32,000
basically going to go to introduction

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:34,559
what I'm doing right now going to be

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,770
going over some of the lucky really

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,070
important log files and locations what

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,450
to look for in the log files what to do

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,620
when you think you found something

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,370
that's important in the log files and

00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,800
then kind of the meat of the

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,140
presentation or I guess maybe the bulk

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,610
are for the most I think the most useful

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,039
part will be some examples some real

00:00:53,610 --> 00:01:01,289
world examples of looking at logs and

00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:03,210
then some Q&A and again as my previous

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,320
session if you have any questions you

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,000
know you don't have to wait until the

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,060
end I mean you can just raise your hand

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,299
and leg me down and you know we can get

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,040
the question answered so let's get

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,750
started and I mean if you have a

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,640
question chances are someone else might

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:22,080
the same questions so feel free to ask

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,850
questions so the key management server

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,799
logs where the logs look the most

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,920
important logs on imagine server are all

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,240
here VAR log cloud management as a bunch

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,340
of logs in there right if you have ever

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,590
looked in there in a classic

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,329
installation you will see a whole lot of

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,650
logs pretty much the only one you ever

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:41,579
care about is the management server

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:43,590
dialogue and it's almost always the most

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,020
important it's almost always the one you

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,590
care about sometimes you want to look at

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:52,860
API server dialog that has API commands

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,530
as they were sent to call stack and the

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,350
IP address have who sent it so can find

00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:01,110
out who broke who broke your cloudstack

00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:03,540
that can come in handy and the rest

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,700
forget about it you know they did you

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,439
know maybe one out of a thousand times I

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,410
don't know some very low percentage of

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,550
usefulness of these other logs I

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,550
actually don't even know what

00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:21,570
besides manager server having loved is

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,250
also loves on the hypervisors cuz oh you

00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:26,810
have question somebody have question no

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,830
sorry okay all right so besides the

00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:31,560
management server there's also allows on

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:34,050
the hypervisors there's xen server logs

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,800
and you know xcp which is bakes the same

00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:41,160
and i'll be a VAR log sm log and the

00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,890
pits info dialog now CloudStack will

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:48,450
mainly log into the sm log storage

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:51,300
manager log and for I guess errors that

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,680
the hypervisor runs into when doing

00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,260
something that CloudStack told it to do

00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,060
we'll be going to zen source dialogue

00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,670
you know in most cases and some of it

00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,850
will go into sm walk but you know just

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,680
depends on the error so but mainly the

00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:07,830
CloudStack actual cloud sex-specific

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,480
logs will be in the sm log so you can

00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,459
find out what cloudstack told it to do

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,130
and when and then kind of try to

00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:19,769
correlate you know what the hypervisor

00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:22,590
did in response to that on kvm we have

00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:24,269
you know several logs but the two

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,970
important logs are the VAR log cloud

00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:30,630
agent agent dialogue that's what the

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:33,690
caustic aging it logs to the note i have

00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:37,140
for that one if the watch out for is by

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:40,440
default useless it's logging at info

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,459
level which is irrelevant so if you

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,329
actually want to do any troubleshooting

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:47,870
have to change the debug mode so and you

00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:51,000
know maybe that's good that it's not on

00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,650
debug by default because it can you know

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,950
eat up the file system pretty fast on

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,910
agents so it just depends on your

00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,640
environment if you have you know

00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,920
terabyte disks and you're managing the

00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,620
logs really well then you can you know

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,720
change the debug so you can kind of do

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,780
like a root cause analysis after the

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,780
fact so I mean I would suggest if at all

00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,720
possible change to debug but if not then

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,430
change the debug as necessary and the

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,859
other log on there is the lib verde

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:22,560
dialog cloudstack agent talks to live

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:23,910
where D does every think does everything

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,940
pretty much does everything it needs to

00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:28,960
do through the vert

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:35,080
so the liver do d dialogue can be

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:37,150
helpful in vsphere basically vcenter

00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,530
logs it's all you ever need there's logs

00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:42,730
a bunch of logs on the esxi host but I

00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,350
never really look at them and you'd

00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:47,250
never really need them usually can find

00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:51,280
out what you need from the vcenter logs

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:53,140
now insensitive and kvm there's also VAR

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,440
log messages I mean it's basically Linux

00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:58,800
operating system rhinos hypervisors so

00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:03,010
there can be stuff that's useful on the

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,970
regular standard VAR log messages and

00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,190
there's not really i don't think there's

00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,980
an equivalent on esxi and i never really

00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,690
would have to look at anyway especially

00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:14,620
on kvm the far log messages will have

00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:18,100
libvirt and kuril errors which is useful

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,510
and then also like in cases where host

00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,180
rebooted that will be in VAR log

00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:24,280
messages sometimes people will say you

00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,560
know why the host go down well you can

00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,540
see well someone rebooted it or you know

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,100
maybe it lost power something like that

00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:34,169
you can you can find that out from the

00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,169
varlet messages and it's pretty helpful

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,210
other logs in the environment will be

00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,310
like on the sand firewalls which is

00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:46,810
these kind of things you can look for

00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:48,190
like permissions errors blocked ports

00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:52,240
for example like if your firewalls

00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:57,310
logging the kind of clocked you know

00:05:52,240 --> 00:06:00,550
some parts right as far as class that

00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:02,770
goes we don't really support to you know

00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,870
help me with that I guess you know

00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,460
Kasich we it isn't really I mean it

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,950
integrates to some extent in some

00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:13,030
devices but not so much in like your

00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:14,860
sand for example so but but you can you

00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,900
can see you can still look at those logs

00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,360
and try to figure out you know you saw

00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,370
error on your hypervisor about can't

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,140
mount a you know primary storage or

00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:26,200
something well then you can look on your

00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:27,160
sand blogs or your nas logs and say well

00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,720
its permissions error you know you

00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,380
didn't we didn't add the permission for

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,080
the IP address of the hype

00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:35,300
you know something like that and I don't

00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,580
have any examples of this because just

00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,680
it's just too far outside of foot not

00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,200
really related cloudstack not directly

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:48,950
at least and I don't have let the fan

00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:51,830
itself to get logs from myself okay what

00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:54,970
to look for in the logs well there's the

00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:57,950
warnings inceptions and errors that's a

00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:01,310
basically this line here the kind of

00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:04,250
keywords you want to look for problem is

00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:06,200
basically that these errors if you have

00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,450
a normal calcite environment you might

00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,490
have a lot of these errors that's

00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:13,850
unrelated to the specific problem you

00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:15,350
looking for so you know that's

00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,900
especially in a larger environment I

00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,310
mean the hypervisors might go down or

00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,680
you know there can be all kinds of

00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:25,790
things going on in the environment so so

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,080
you know just looking for these areas it

00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,850
just it's just part of the puzzle

00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,070
basically you know if you if you just

00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:33,530
grip for Warren I mean you're just going

00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:38,480
to have a long time going through those

00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:40,040
that result of that grep output right so

00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,990
so you're gonna have to be able to

00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,090
narrow down a lot not just a little bit

00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,890
you need to really narrow it down much

00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:48,170
as you can so one of the things I like

00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:50,060
to look for is the vm name you know

00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:53,840
usually there's some kind of task the vm

00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:56,360
couldn't start or fail to stop maybe or

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,640
or failed to deploy and you know looking

00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,200
for the vm name actually can help i can

00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,090
help narrow down because that's very

00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,010
specific and you can find the vm name

00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:06,170
and then look for the warrant or errors

00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:08,710
or exceptions and stuff so that can be

00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,710
useful

00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,320
right so caustic really good so the

00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,690
questions about how often you have a

00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,180
problem that's not actually having one

00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:29,400
of these you know warnings or you're

00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:32,020
clear Warren sometimes not too often

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,729
occasionally i guess i would say usually

00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:36,729
there will be at least an exception

00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:38,020
something like that when I was like it

00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:40,360
just basically if there's if there's

00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,580
some weird failure that you're not

00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,280
getting a really clean error you'll get

00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:47,130
an exception at least you know

00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:51,010
occasionally there'll be something that

00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:53,230
yeah basically isn't logged at all at

00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,870
diva net debug level and I'll go into

00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,280
that actually actually the next flying

00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:01,750
trace you know sometimes you have to

00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:04,990
enable trace to get a useful error look

00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:07,240
good not that often usually some weird

00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:11,020
problem basically would be having to

00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:13,090
enable trace the other thing to help

00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:16,960
their narrow things down on will be the

00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:20,140
type of task basically you know you have

00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:22,420
the vm name maybe you're not deploying

00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,040
with the or something maybe something up

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,240
no you know there's not like a clear

00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,760
maybe you don't have the vm name for

00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,710
example they said you know your your end

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,750
user said you know I couldn't deploy a

00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:34,900
vm and then you ask well with the vm

00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,310
name and i don't know what well you know

00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,770
then you can't you know you get the

00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,870
scratch up the vm name then at least

00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,910
they should be able to tell you you know

00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:44,830
what failed at least I couldn't deploy a

00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:47,250
vm so you could you could grip for the

00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:49,660
type of test deploy a vm or starve vm or

00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:53,800
copy template you know any of these

00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:57,460
things the one kind of hard thing i

00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,710
guess is that the task name in the log

00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:02,650
is not consistent with the API commands

00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:06,280
so like if you said well I did restart

00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:07,540
router API command and you can't grip

00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,220
the log but we thought router because

00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,570
it's not going to save restart router or

00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,580
maybe maybe it does in that case but

00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:16,570
there's a lot of love them it's not the

00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:18,410
same you can just figure it out or just

00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:20,899
with experience you'll remember that

00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:24,350
to you know deploy virtual machine a

00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:26,420
dead man is like deploy vm in love

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:29,240
something like that can help to like

00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:31,970
search grip the logs without case you

00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:35,089
know the dash I to grip you can just

00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:36,860
grab and not worry about the case

00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:38,480
because it might be very similar to API

00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,060
command was a different case so that

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,220
that's useful but to prom with that is

00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:46,120
it might be slow if you have like a five

00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:49,279
gigabyte management server dialogue

00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:53,350
doing case-insensitive crap is going to

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:55,399
take an hour so yeah besides grab

00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:58,579
actually don't even use a grip that much

00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:00,410
personally mainly I used less I think

00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:02,329
it's just personal preference and you

00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,310
can kind of just two I like with less

00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:07,279
you can kind of step through the steps

00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:08,689
to the log file let's grab grab if

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,850
you've grabbed four things that's the

00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:12,920
really one of the big problems with grip

00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:15,769
if you grip for one of these important

00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,300
things it's going to give you most of

00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:19,279
the important stuff but then a bunch of

00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,980
this stuff a bunch of the lines are not

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:24,980
going to have one of those keywords so

00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,540
you know I guess you can see look at

00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,339
grandpa's kind of a starting point you

00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,860
up for the worn on the ending or

00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:32,600
something and then then you go from

00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:36,860
there like looking directly in the log

00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,509
the raw log file with less then you can

00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,389
find like for example like if there's an

00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:43,069
exception well the exceptions I have one

00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:45,199
line that tells you exception and then

00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:49,040
there's going to be like 50 like a bunch

00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:50,569
of lines of with java files right so

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,399
without without the word exception in

00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:55,430
that line so what do you do there well

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,290
you need to look at the log directly and

00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,750
that gives you some funny examples so i

00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:02,689
have an example of that too so we'll go

00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:06,380
into the that into the examples all

00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:09,769
right enable trace you know sometimes

00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:12,259
your stuff oops yea enable trace

00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:15,170
sometimes you need an able trace this

00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:18,439
line if you're not paying attention pay

00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:21,259
attention just for 30 seconds if you

00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:24,230
ever see avoid set just don't complain

00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:26,839
why the host is in a void set how do I

00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:28,350
get out of the void set doesn't mean

00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:31,809
anything

00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:34,899
you have to scroll up just a little bit

00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:36,639
in the log to find the problem the avoid

00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:39,129
that means there was a problem like 10

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,259
lines earlier it's not the holster and

00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:42,550
then void set forever and you know you

00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:44,439
hack the database to get to have the

00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,910
avoid set you have to get it you have to

00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:48,189
read the logger a little bit more to

00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:50,139
figure out you know the voice that's

00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:52,240
just a transitory thing it's just for

00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:54,999
that job you know you do something it

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,370
fails the love something else some hosts

00:12:54,999 --> 00:13:02,559
are in a void set and then it's over

00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:04,689
rated then well yeah in between 10 and

00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:08,319
10 and you know two gigabytes of lines

00:13:04,689 --> 00:13:10,620
all right yes 10 in a month or something

00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:10,620
right

00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:28,100
that's just what the log says it says

00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:30,980
coast is in avoid set yeah I wanted to

00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:33,889
say hosting the voice said please please

00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:36,079
scroll up please just just stop thinking

00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:39,829
about a voice and scroll up i don't know

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:48,019
maybe that's too long but so yeah just

00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:49,430
scroll up if you see that and well they

00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:51,430
can't have more i think it's as I guess

00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:54,319
it's set because there will be multiple

00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:57,639
items or hosts and the avoid like a set

00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:59,959
of them a group of them yeah yeah I

00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:02,000
don't think there's an avoid state as

00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:03,170
far as I know but this is this is what

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,410
you'll see in logs to avoid said all the

00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:07,579
time I mean I've seen everybody else

00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:09,680
like why it's in there why is the house

00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:12,319
and a voice said now what do i do where

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:25,670
do i click in the UI to disable it from

00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:27,139
the ovoid set it might be it's just for

00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,899
the job and as far as i know it's only

00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:32,180
per job you know what once that jobs

00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:33,800
over and that you know i mean as far as

00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:35,000
a no i mean you might still get if you

00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,740
reach I the air you'll get the same

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,569
avoids that error just because it failed

00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,569
again and got stuck in the avoid said

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,459
well it's probably cached but probably

00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,889
just a memory or something it's just so

00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:51,769
like the job doesn't try to like deploy

00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:56,300
to the host a thousand times and fail

00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:58,069
every time I'm not that knowledgeable on

00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,649
the code so i don't know the details of

00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:02,720
them would say but i just know like

00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:04,850
people always ask why it's and avoid

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,040
said and how do i do it how to fix that

00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:10,760
so anyway error text from you I API is

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:14,839
really valuable because you can find

00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:16,910
that logs usually if you have like error

00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:19,069
in the logs and in the UI or API of

00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:22,160
course then yeah it helps to start with

00:15:19,069 --> 00:15:23,930
that and you want to go for this text

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,900
exactly two and i'm going to go over

00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:31,770
examples to job ID

00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:33,720
face palm that the job ID that the API

00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:37,110
you I gives you another you I but the

00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:40,980
apac gives you a job ID now logged why

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:43,730
not how to get the job ID you get it

00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:47,970
from the database or you figure it out

00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:51,420
right so and so what I mean about job ID

00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:55,290
the API since classic 30 there's a bit

00:15:51,420 --> 00:16:00,030
of a uuid that 36 character is the huge

00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:02,940
long string of you know text giving a

00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:05,340
job and then in the logs it's based

00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,260
still from the concept you know previous

00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:10,350
versions where it's a numerical ID so

00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:13,500
the logs will have job hyphen and then a

00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:16,320
number like 200 but the API will give

00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,450
you job ID you know some you know gue

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,960
it's a long thing and that goo is not

00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:24,420
walking yeah maybe it would be good if

00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:27,270
it's locked but it will be easier it

00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:31,140
might save you time and you can get it

00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:33,150
from the database somewhere I forgot

00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,550
leurs I should have example later I can

00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:41,090
show you I don't remember off hand where

00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:43,710
it is but I think it's in my slides ok

00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:47,580
Boche eighth is my size right my nose

00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:49,910
yeah it's in li you're a sink

00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:54,180
underscored job table so you can get the

00:16:49,910 --> 00:17:00,690
get to get the real job ID I kiss from

00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:01,980
the good job ID all right and then don't

00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,940
you know if you're not familiar with

00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,770
what I'm saying you know I'm going to

00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:08,010
have examples you know in a couple

00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:11,520
slides starting so so besides jobs their

00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:13,800
sequences they're basically you know the

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,940
job inside of a job you can have

00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:20,250
multiple sequences basically the job for

00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:22,020
whatever reason needs to do something I

00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,570
guess asynchronously from the rest of

00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:27,900
the job and we'll just send a sequence

00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:30,000
to something like a host or a other

00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,280
management server even right so like if

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,650
you see host like executing request or

00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,750
response received in the logs for

00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,700
sequence that's basically sending it to

00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,820
a particular hosts like a hypervisor

00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,550
basically great

00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,590
and for if you have cluster management

00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:47,080
servers and you see forwarding seek and

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,400
then the ID sequence ID and it's

00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,550
actually sending that sequence to

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:56,230
another CloudStack server to to process

00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:59,280
it right and so jobs are basically going

00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:02,020
to be / ja ru sequences are going to be

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,780
containing in a job right but then the

00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:07,660
sequences can actually intermingle

00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:10,180
across jobs basically like if you have

00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:12,220
two jobs doing something and then the

00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,690
kickoff sequences those sequences can

00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:17,110
interfere with each other basically

00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:19,900
which you can be interesting when you're

00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:21,130
troubleshooting and so basically like

00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:24,130
you're if you're troubleshooting your

00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:26,230
job and the sequence yes the sequence in

00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,910
the job you care about is getting stuck

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:33,370
could get stuck because of sequence in

00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:34,900
some other job okay so one more side of

00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:36,150
information than getting two examples

00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,070
because I want to get a lot of examples

00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:41,590
into the presentation so what the do

00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:44,170
office lee depends on the errors there's

00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:46,470
different things different types of

00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:48,310
errors of course so you might get

00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:51,520
capacity errors if you see something

00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:53,080
capacity related in the logs most of the

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,200
time it's going to be something about

00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:58,450
capacity so you can check like the host

00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,710
make sure they have enough space on the

00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:04,750
primary storage or ram or or whatever

00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:06,310
and it could be any any kind of resource

00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,110
that the caltech managing could be like

00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:11,170
IP addresses or something you know it's

00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:13,830
it's not just like ram clearly capacity

00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:18,400
related it's you know IP addresses or

00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:20,440
things like that right network the logs

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,630
you might have an error about like no

00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,180
route to host or connection refused I

00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:29,560
mean these things pretty pretty much a

00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:33,400
point usually to network problems so

00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:35,740
yeah another thing you can do is just

00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,750
keep waiting sometimes the job just take

00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,160
a long time you know maybe they

00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:41,410
shouldn't or maybe they should it just

00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:44,920
depends on the job and just depends on

00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:47,860
the situation so so you know try to keep

00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:49,450
waiting if you can and the next solution

00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:53,470
is to hack the database and try it again

00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:58,030
well it's usually wrong wouldn't that

00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:59,590
advised that but you can do that but you

00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,020
know if you have problems resulting from

00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:04,800
that you know dumpling don't blame

00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:08,620
CloudStack for for you you're hacking

00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,770
okay so let's do some examples start

00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:14,110
with a very basic kind of like the

00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:15,760
nicest example you can start with you

00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:18,490
have the vm name you have this

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,790
screenshot or a code of the texts from

00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:24,190
from the UI or the api right so that's

00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:26,110
just the perfect it's so easy right so

00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,670
basically you grant for this i mean i

00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,860
guess maybe you can't see that well but

00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:32,140
it says unable to pre-deployment 4pm and

00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,580
then the name of the vm right well if

00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,140
you look you can grip the log or even

00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:37,540
like just use less and look at the log

00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:41,740
and you find this exact error text

00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:44,830
unable to create deployment for vm then

00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:47,140
you so you found the job right job 318

00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:49,720
so do they no matter what the api job

00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:52,110
told you it's some good right but the

00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,810
real job in the law of the job to 18 and

00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:57,490
then then you can look in job through 18

00:20:55,810 --> 00:21:00,160
you know try to figure out what happened

00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,720
it's usually the error message will be

00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,860
at the end of the job because it just

00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:07,660
right yet the job fails and the jobs

00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:10,630
over and gives you error message right

00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:12,700
so you find the error message and then

00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,950
you scroll up immediately stop looking

00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,170
below the error message and look up and

00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:19,960
don't ignore just ignored the avoid said

00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:21,790
errors you good and just scroll up you

00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:25,110
can see no clusters found having a host

00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,110
of enough capacity so

00:21:28,279 --> 00:22:00,989
I mean is it sooo yeah hey it's not just

00:21:36,059 --> 00:22:02,970
yeah right yeah it's not it's not

00:22:00,989 --> 00:22:07,230
cloudstack failing it's just the job

00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:08,850
failed yeah i mean i just did this i

00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:13,769
mean i just used in this example was

00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:15,450
this there was i just used the I kind of

00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:18,690
make a vm that was too big to boot

00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:21,239
anywhere so it wasn't I can see your

00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:23,090
point could hear but another hand it's

00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:25,499
not really close like failing it's just

00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:29,100
you know the India is like a user error

00:22:25,499 --> 00:22:31,139
basically so I don't know so that's a

00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,600
beautiful solution the beautiful case

00:22:31,139 --> 00:22:36,869
you've got their message from the UI and

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:45,350
the vm name even and you can easily find

00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:49,559
Olivia job ID so next would be void set

00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:50,879
just want to hammer this home why why is

00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:54,419
the hosting of voice it and how do i

00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:59,119
remove it oh you stop that you don't ask

00:22:54,419 --> 00:23:01,169
that anymore please so that's okay

00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:03,269
there's not nothing to second me this is

00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:05,159
this is the voice errors basically just

00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:08,159
means you need to scroll up in the log

00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:09,809
and you can help even have a job ID so

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,379
it makes it easy for you the voice that

00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:18,710
tells you oh well at least the job you

00:23:13,379 --> 00:23:18,710
know 17 whatever that one is 17 yeah

00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:34,160
yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah means you

00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:37,100
scroll up so if you found found that

00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,809
avoid there you know like a few

00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:41,090
milliseconds earlier is the real error

00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:42,860
so this case it's not like a month later

00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:45,140
it's at least at least within the same

00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:49,400
second so that's good and again the

00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:51,679
should have like a good job idea so you

00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:54,740
can see and this actually is an

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:58,040
interesting example in this case we did

00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:01,660
grab we had the output of a grep not the

00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:06,110
actual log so can see the actual error

00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:11,150
is cut off unable to study see the

00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:13,160
injury due to oh nothing don't cut it

00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:16,610
off there's they must have grabbed for

00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:18,169
error or something and you know and

00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:24,559
there's no there's no there's no answer

00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:25,910
wacom actually so anyway so hypervisor

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,040
errors will show up in the clouds

00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:31,370
backlogs imagine server dialogue in this

00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,690
case we have a xen server error not too

00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:35,000
common anymore i used to be a big

00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:38,179
problem with this sr back in failure or

00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,059
46 and my slide if you get my slides

00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:44,690
there's the solution like four steps

00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:46,280
right to fix the SR but you can see it

00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:48,530
minutes if if you see this kind of thing

00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:51,410
I mean straight from the hypervisor so

00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:52,910
it's like cause like failing because of

00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:55,429
something happened on hypervisor so

00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:57,650
there's nothing cloud that can do just

00:24:55,429 --> 00:25:00,080
faith I visored couldn't do it do what

00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:03,799
was trying to do probably in this case

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,450
is starting a vm so yeah just too if you

00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:08,169
get this kind of thing then you got it

00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:09,919
will check the hypervisor next right and

00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:13,240
you know I'm not going to pick on

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:16,640
xenserver I'm a equal opportunity

00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:20,480
presented on click on them all so next

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:23,809
we have error from k vm manager dialog

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,850
we have this crazy umount error and the

00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:26,419
management server to log the vice is

00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:30,590
busy

00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:33,289
you what is all this I don't know so we

00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:38,119
check VAR log messages on a hypervisor

00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:41,389
and there's more craziness and actually

00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:43,159
didn't have the all the logs from VAR

00:25:41,389 --> 00:25:45,859
log messages but this is the one I had

00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:47,869
it's been there there would be another

00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:49,580
met in this example there was another

00:25:47,869 --> 00:25:52,580
message about file not found and it's

00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:54,200
actually a bug in libvirt so the

00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:56,239
solution this one was you touch that

00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:02,149
filed it liver can't find for some

00:25:56,239 --> 00:26:05,809
reason it was fixed in no it's fixed in

00:26:02,149 --> 00:26:08,299
09 for effort so this particular one but

00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:09,230
just just give you an example of finding

00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:11,029
the error you know you have the

00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:14,330
Vengeance rid of log you have the you

00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:16,700
mount ayr I mean you can kind of see the

00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:18,350
clippard exception I mean it's clear

00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,749
from levert it's nothing about cause

00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:22,009
back so then you can go in far log

00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:23,419
messages or you can probably check

00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:28,159
something similar in the liver daddy

00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:32,059
find something oh yeah and here's some

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,980
VMware and then you know Craig command

00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:37,519
failed and like some message about this

00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:39,590
like what is all this you know in this

00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:41,899
case I would say you know go bug VMware

00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:44,419
because this is probably VMware bug yes

00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:48,289
the business this particular log is

00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:50,960
because the the path is too long the

00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:54,739
path if the hdds path is too long

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,929
because whatever vcenter doesn't like a

00:26:54,739 --> 00:27:00,230
path that's too long so the solution is

00:26:56,929 --> 00:27:03,379
renamed sr to be to remove because the

00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:06,109
classic will rename the s RS rsr so the

00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:07,789
data stores in visa and vsphere the the

00:27:06,109 --> 00:27:10,429
data store is caustic will name them

00:27:07,789 --> 00:27:12,859
with a good with hyphens but sometimes

00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:15,889
those extra for hyphens just makes

00:27:12,859 --> 00:27:18,289
vcenter keel over and doesn't like it so

00:27:15,889 --> 00:27:21,230
in this case we because it's like a

00:27:18,289 --> 00:27:25,609
hyphen name hyphens from the data store

00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:27,980
name and fixed it so yeah and yeah so

00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:29,359
just watch it for them but I mean again

00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,899
it's just an example like what kind of

00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:34,980
things you might see from the hypervisor

00:27:31,899 --> 00:27:38,940
making it the air for my advisor

00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:42,179
it's wade into CloudStack so exceptions

00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:44,700
are you know what you will see for some

00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:47,250
problems maybe I don't know percentage i

00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,540
did a good chunk of percentage good

00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:51,150
chunk of the time will have an exception

00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:53,460
of some kind of error and you know i'm

00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:55,919
not a really good at a code so i don't

00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,809
really know that much about looking at

00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,610
perceptions I just know like looking at

00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:03,660
the first few lines of the exception are

00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:05,429
the valuable information so we see like

00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:08,429
another oil this will acquire lock on a

00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:10,710
storage pool and then something about

00:28:08,429 --> 00:28:12,270
template manager and then some database

00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:15,600
and then some things I don't know what

00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:16,919
it is so in this case it's probably

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,710
something will they did with the

00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:22,320
template so then we can ask ask the has

00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:25,169
to you know end user or whoever did this

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:28,740
to my CloudStack ask them what they did

00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:31,500
and why and how how they do it and in

00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:33,720
this case the problem was Klaus that

00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:36,570
good they were trying to deploy like 10

00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,520
VMs at once from a new template and tell

00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:41,940
us that didn't like it and so I mean

00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:44,460
this is above I think so I I would do I

00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,049
think this case is still open solid I

00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,970
don't know if it's filed yet but it will

00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:49,860
be filed because Kyle section get an

00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:57,419
exception when you just deploying 10

00:28:49,860 --> 00:29:00,809
videos okay so forwarding sequences you

00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:03,990
see that dude it's like i said earlier

00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:06,960
forwarding sequence number basically

00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:08,910
this clouds back server is sending this

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,640
jaw or this the sequence saying this

00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:14,160
sequence to another cause deck server in

00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:18,120
a cluster now in this case we have cars

00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:21,960
he's like saying wait a minute wait a

00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:25,500
minute why i see this 40 message when i

00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,419
only have one class x server hello yeah

00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,240
that was the case he only had one class

00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:31,740
x server and we checked the database and

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,179
there was duplicate entries for the

00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,950
management server ID so the class x

00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:37,710
server was just farting everything to

00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:39,299
itself and as you can imagine didn't

00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,909
work

00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:43,110
yeah it was interesting the UI we can

00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:44,700
you couldn't I think you couldn't lie

00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:47,489
think it could log on to the UI but then

00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:50,700
you can do anything else and so we just

00:29:47,489 --> 00:29:53,879
deleted the extra entries in the

00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:56,940
database but it was it was a weird one

00:29:53,879 --> 00:30:00,450
and the engineering said it's Nev

00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:03,389
supposed to happen can never happen it

00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:04,889
costs Dec 3 and above used to be a

00:30:03,389 --> 00:30:07,649
problem in the previous version but not

00:30:04,889 --> 00:30:13,739
in 93 it's fixed anyway it was this was

00:30:07,649 --> 00:30:16,999
from call secretary all right so a trace

00:30:13,739 --> 00:30:18,869
example and like your example like why

00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:22,109
you know when you don't see something

00:30:18,869 --> 00:30:25,230
like obviously an error right so in this

00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:29,429
case we had the the there was an error

00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:32,249
in the UI but just dude we couldn't

00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:35,340
figure it out basically they were taking

00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:39,269
a snapshot of a volume right so crazy

00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:41,429
snapshot can see right all right right

00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:44,389
and so in this example we have they

00:30:41,429 --> 00:30:46,619
trying to create a snapshot and they are

00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:48,179
we have the volume which snapshot of

00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:51,480
China which which volume the train of

00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:54,330
snapshot so we're looking at volume 4500

00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:58,320
and a snapshot so you can see in this a

00:30:54,330 --> 00:31:02,190
sick job submission you can see crate

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:06,059
snapshot command which is good and the

00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:09,659
volume ID is somewhere in here I could

00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:11,309
have formed yeah volume ID 4500 so so

00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,929
yeah with that him from most with with

00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:16,799
you know someone the information you can

00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:20,070
find out you know what what the inducer

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:21,749
is talking about why it failed but then

00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:23,999
there was no error there wasn't there

00:31:21,749 --> 00:31:26,340
was the problem when the logs I would

00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:28,529
think is a bug we enabled trace Swift

00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:31,259
enable trace to get the the text that

00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:32,940
was in the UI I don't know why that I

00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:36,929
mean that should be at least debug I

00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:40,019
guess but the internal error was logged

00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:41,980
at trace only so in that case we had to

00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:47,110
enable trace

00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:48,580
um not really but you know this is just

00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:50,230
an example of why you wouldn't need

00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:55,210
trace like if you want to see the error

00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:58,960
that you in jersey was getting it

00:31:55,210 --> 00:32:00,340
probably would yeah but I was enabling

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,840
trace should try to get some more

00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,730
information about the error in general I

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,679
just I include this injury just too

00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:13,450
because it's something useful logged

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:16,030
only a trace and then yeah then the next

00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:18,490
the next actually is the same air the

00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:20,620
same problem at the actual error didn't

00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:24,040
require trace there's an exceptional got

00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:27,250
an exception there's active snapshot

00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:29,220
tasks on the instance same instance so

00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:31,450
they were doing two snapshots that once

00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,679
well according to the log they were

00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,660
doing it they're doing it Ernest

00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:36,820
snapshot of vm that was already being

00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:38,290
snapshot at the same time actually that

00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:40,390
wasn't really what happened and that's

00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:42,549
one because there was some kind of bug

00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:45,270
or something that the snapshot was in

00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:48,220
the wrong state was stuck in the

00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:51,850
transitory State that says it's being

00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:54,100
created so yeah but but normally you

00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:56,020
would get I guess you'd get this if your

00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:58,210
snap shutting a vm and try to snap shut

00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:59,770
again real quick so yeah I mean you

00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,419
didn't really you know I sorry about

00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:03,850
this is not the best example to show why

00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:05,290
you would use trace but to in this

00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:08,260
quantum you didn't need trace exactly

00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:12,850
but there was some information at trace

00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:14,770
level that was useful so what kind our

00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:17,230
one of the things you want to do is be

00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:18,940
patient so God's sakes just just just

00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:23,620
slow down a little bit sometimes and

00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:25,240
just go get a coffee or something so in

00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,950
this case I'm just going to go step I

00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,870
mean you don't need to care about all

00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:30,640
these lines really i'm just going to

00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:33,840
step through what the what to the lines

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:36,280
mean right so you see at eleven-thirty 1

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,669
59 seconds they did someone deployed a

00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:42,370
vm right and then you know 10 seconds

00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:44,470
later 732 in 10 seconds the template

00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:48,640
starts being transferred right so that

00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:50,650
happens right and then the admin he

00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,809
didn't even this are just end user doing

00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:54,990
something he's deploying of vm and then

00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:59,530
the admin decided to reboot a virtual

00:33:54,990 --> 00:34:02,500
at the 12 13 so like you know like half

00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:04,000
an hour oh geez 40 minutes later well

00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:07,570
that temple is still being copied he's

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,200
trying to reboot the router so tilt 1306

00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:13,440
reboot the router and told her to North

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:17,260
six we see this waiting for seek

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:22,440
sequence right stop command is being

00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:26,169
scheduled for the reboot the router and

00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:28,530
so at 1241 that template finally

00:34:26,169 --> 00:34:31,780
transferred over it successfully and

00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:35,169
then the virtual router reboot can

00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:38,050
actually be done and it takes like 64

00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:40,450
seconds I don't know why would you know

00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:43,960
I don't know why wait for you know 40

00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:46,590
minutes to to actually send the job that

00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,370
took four seconds but that's what I did

00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:50,440
so in this case you know the

00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:52,990
administrator was very good about being

00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,460
patient and said well I reap your router

00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:57,490
but I'm going to wait and just see what

00:34:54,460 --> 00:35:01,450
happens but you know that's not all

00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:03,240
admins you know some madness of some web

00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:05,710
browsing to do or something can't wait

00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,830
so in this case they're doing as a

00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:12,340
destroyer outer so @ 9 05 they destroy

00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:14,470
router and 905 immediately cloud sextons

00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:16,630
destroy router command to one of the

00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:23,580
hosts in this case is a kvm host right

00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:26,320
host 57 and it finished 40 minutes later

00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:28,570
well that took a long time to destroy a

00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:32,560
virtual router so what the heck was

00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:34,360
going on here so while we say you know

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,860
why the host took 40 minutes to route to

00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,020
destroy the router well we check the log

00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:40,870
on the port rudder the agent dialog was

00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:43,240
a good example during the time that they

00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:45,340
returned to Australia router there was

00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,470
some connectivity problems probably

00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:49,480
their switch was down who knows and Nick

00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:51,130
had problems I don't know couldn't

00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:55,350
contact management server so obviously

00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:58,090
can't do any jobs can't run anything and

00:35:55,350 --> 00:36:00,460
so it didn't the host the host actually

00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:03,970
this is still agent dialog you know

00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:04,780
until elect 944 actually got a job in

00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:08,080
two

00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:12,190
seated within you know immediately yeah

00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:14,440
few milliseconds let the admin's not

00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:15,730
that patient so 20 minutes after the

00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:19,870
first destroyed by are they hacked the

00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:25,060
database reran destroyed router double

00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:26,310
facepalm right so yeah and guess what

00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:30,460
happened it's already destroyed router

00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:34,300
sequin or queued up so the second one is

00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:37,120
is waiting right and then the sequence

00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,680
is the first one actually finished and

00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:41,410
then the second one is sent and angie

00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:45,820
was it can't run it it's already deleted

00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:47,770
so yeah in this case it was useful to

00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:49,540
look at asian dialogue because to figure

00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:51,040
out what will happened and also look you

00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:54,010
saw the hook emmanuel server dialogue is

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:58,270
why the admin took the actions they did

00:36:54,010 --> 00:37:00,430
and why they you know why what they said

00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:02,080
what they said was you know they hacked

00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:03,760
the database after 20 minutes and then

00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,240
it worked right well it didn't actually

00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,280
work if you check the logs have physical

00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,200
evidence that what they did didn't work

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,380
it says right here they hacked the

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:17,380
database they waited a little bit longer

00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:19,960
and then failed but because the first

00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:26,140
one actually succeeded so anyway just be

00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:28,690
patient there so sometimes you have some

00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:31,570
weird anomalies I would call them in the

00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:33,340
log entry is so lost time there's no

00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:37,960
alien abductions of Cloud Servers that

00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:41,020
we've seen ever the basic we lost time

00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:43,240
would be gaps huge gaps in the inner cos

00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:45,940
I clocks right so basically if you're

00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:48,820
cloudstack log is skipping one second

00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:50,290
then there is a major problem there's

00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:52,590
not going to be one second of downtime

00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:55,410
and I was like with debug right ever

00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:57,370
maybe maybe if it's not doing anything

00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:59,200
maybe it's just cause deck installed

00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:00,970
with no hypervisors it's going to be no

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,770
injuries for a second but in all case

00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:06,610
any kind of real environment is going to

00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:08,080
be millions every second the other weird

00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:10,990
following I have the injuries that have

00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:13,750
log out of order in the log so like the

00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:15,730
time non-sequential time so caustic

00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:18,130
doesn't travel backwards in time doesn't

00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:19,330
like reverse like doesn't like hit some

00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:21,640
problem and say oh I'm going to build

00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:25,120
backwards for a while and try to fix it

00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:27,940
doesn't work like that and then zero

00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:32,580
bike imagine sort of love is never going

00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:35,140
to be ever never never going to happen

00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:39,730
not even for like a tenth of a second to

00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:42,660
right so yeah like zero bias is probably

00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:44,890
disk is full right which can happen and

00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:47,740
then the last time we're out of order

00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:50,860
log entries usually some like some kind

00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:54,190
of server load problem like who knows

00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:55,630
will happen something happened case that

00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:59,260
you know made me think about these

00:38:55,630 --> 00:39:00,520
things was they were losing their

00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:03,370
management server was becoming

00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:06,390
inaccessible for 10 minutes every day at

00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:09,310
midnight so like what's the heck is that

00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:11,890
why is that happening every day at

00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:13,870
midnight they cost like basically down I

00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:16,390
mean it's running but it's down I mean

00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:18,310
not not accessible so looking at laws we

00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:22,240
had these problems lost Tom and out of

00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:26,500
order and looking a little bit closer we

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:29,430
found that the vlogs were like the API

00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:32,080
server dialogue was like four gigs a day

00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:34,180
managers row dialogue was like six gigs

00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,550
a day and so at midnight when they're

00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:39,730
rotating is blowing up the server geez

00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:42,070
dipping those files and so so I mean if

00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:44,230
you're G zipping like those you know 10

00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:45,820
gigs of stuff it's going to slow down

00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:47,260
your server but I mean that's just an

00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:50,890
example I mean you can have high load

00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:52,030
for other reasons too but wait a few if

00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:56,200
you see this is definitely something

00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:58,210
weird happen and so in that case I told

00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:01,870
them to rotate every hour because you

00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:04,150
know cutting of 1 10 gigs of compression

00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:06,360
files you know over 24 hours as much

00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:06,360
about

00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:12,579
so nearby entries sometimes well

00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:15,190
basically it's not helpful because this

00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:16,599
can be so much going on in the logs you

00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,790
see an error and then like the line

00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:21,520
before it is completely unrelated

00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:23,470
normally but I mean sometimes you can

00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:27,099
kind of look for like something that's

00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:29,290
at least a little bit related so like in

00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:34,000
this case there's an error you know they

00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:35,619
restart the call stack and the VMS rha

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,810
is being triggered on like five VMs for

00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:40,030
some reason what the heck is that about

00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:44,440
i just restarted call stack and that was

00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:46,839
triggering a che well you can kind of

00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,810
find something nearby you know here it's

00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:52,780
like within you know one tenth of a

00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:55,839
second that's like 11 yeah what kind of

00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:58,359
a second or so away we see at least this

00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:02,109
error is kind of really saying as like

00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:07,780
the vm vm idea is 12 for 35 so this line

00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:09,849
has 141 2 for 2 12 423 so it's kind of

00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:12,400
similar and it's kind of related and

00:41:09,849 --> 00:41:16,619
this was like this was a bug to some

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,619
there's some stale stuff in the database

00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:21,990
and any questions

00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:25,990
enough questions

00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:29,910
and I can go back over any other

00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:40,320
examples or go over more details or

00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:42,870
anything yeah so log aggregation like

00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:45,180
splunk or something like that I think

00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:48,690
some customers using splunk or similar

00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:50,460
products just a lot of logs so it's

00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:59,450
going to be a lot of information for

00:41:50,460 --> 00:42:03,080
your vlog server to take the log level

00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:06,060
right yeah there's a file log4j

00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:08,100
configuration file it's in my slides I

00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:10,680
think so if you have if you get a slides

00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:13,110
there should be like one of the way in

00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:15,540
the notes I think there's like a yeah

00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:18,720
yeah to change in a with trace logging

00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:23,760
you edit on the management server is /

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:27,420
EDC / cloud / management log4j xml doc

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:30,650
off and you change the category komm

00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:33,870
doch cloud to trace and set up debug and

00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:37,830
it's very similar on the kvm agent is

00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:40,260
just like a UTC cloud agent log4j

00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:42,480
probably something something along those

00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:45,140
lines and you can change the debug from

00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,140
info level

00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:51,590
Yeah right yeah you don't need to

00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:53,900
restart you when you edited log4j then

00:42:51,590 --> 00:43:00,350
then classic will just pick it up within

00:42:53,900 --> 00:43:02,870
you know 10 seconds or something yeah

00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:04,700
should be very very very fast so you can

00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:06,200
kind of just like then tail the log and

00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:08,210
look for the trace injuries to start

00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:23,320
logging in them and start digging into

00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:23,320
it any other questions yeah sure

00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:38,960
ya know we'll check the documentation

00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:47,450
for sure as Allah has a lot of good

00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:49,780
information well you can get things

00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:52,520
about the troubleshooting is you can get

00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:53,840
information I mean this the dedicated

00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,570
troubleshooting section which is kind of

00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:58,460
short I guess but but you know if you're

00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:59,810
understood from there what's up with

00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:01,850
like the rest of the documentation like

00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:03,890
reading about the product in general you

00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:07,910
kind of know you know where to look I

00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:10,730
think besides just having like a formal

00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:16,070
troubleshooting stuff to look at because

00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:17,930
you know me and you know I guess the

00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:21,950
knowledge base has some stuff too yeah

00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:28,010
the citrix knowledge base and the Apache

00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:29,600
wiki it was like wiki right and I have

00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:34,340
forums to write there's a builder cloud

00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:36,170
org forums i think has a lot of well

00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:38,000
used to it that i think has the same

00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:40,760
content as it used to before that was my

00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,410
greeted so that has a lot of information

00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,360
about troubleshooting so yeah I mean

00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:47,150
it's troubleshooting it's always like

00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:50,510
hard to to learn it's kind of like you

00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:52,370
learn by doing essentially so so yeah I

00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:53,630
mean if you're I guess if you're

00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:56,420
installing clouds like you're going to

00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:58,670
be learning the cello shot anyway

00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:00,200
because you install I didn't if it works

00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:08,150
then you know you should apply for a job

00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:10,520
at citrix first time I guess now I'm

00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:13,130
just you know exaggerating a little bit

00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:15,170
you know normally if you mean even I

00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:17,240
install you know you make mistakes you

00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:18,890
make a typo like like what I was

00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:21,620
installing and you know we typed the

00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:24,620
wrong URL for the system vm template

00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:27,140
creation and then like doesn't boot so

00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:29,030
then you have to figure it out so I mean

00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:31,610
it's just to make it happen to anybody

00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:34,010
it's just it's it's I guess is a

00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:37,310
complicated installation and complicated

00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:38,900
to manage so as long as you're using it

00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:40,730
for you know any length of time you're

00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,640
just going to probably run into some

00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:45,620
scenarios where you need to fix it and

00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,940
of course you can check the Apache IRC

00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:49,579
and mailing lists

00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:51,200
to ask for advice but you know hopefully

00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:53,300
with like it some of this information

00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,339
you can look at the logs yourself and do

00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:57,940
you know these don't complain about to

00:45:55,339 --> 00:45:57,940
avoid set

00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:26,859
yeah i mean this Apache that you can

00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:28,720
just follow bugs for it you know if

00:46:26,859 --> 00:46:30,640
you're paying sister citrix customer

00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:35,619
then we can escalate to directly to some

00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:37,269
of the citrix funded developers but you

00:46:35,619 --> 00:46:39,009
know it's open source I mean you can a

00:46:37,269 --> 00:46:42,400
you can fix it yourself submit a patch

00:46:39,009 --> 00:46:57,069
or or you can use the community

00:46:42,400 --> 00:47:01,329
resources or filing bugs okay yeah for

00:46:57,069 --> 00:47:04,019
the what has your chainsaw I don't know

00:47:01,329 --> 00:47:04,019
that is I'm sorry

00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:13,010
chainsaw he's like yeah I don't know I'm

00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:16,100
not from my okay oh my god like a okay

00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:18,619
like a Splunk type thing sort of yeah I

00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:20,990
mean you can I mean you can just some of

00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:22,730
like the things i had mentioned early on

00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:25,450
without what's a grip for and stuff I

00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:30,530
was like preventive medicine measures

00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:31,970
wherever was but it's like yeah here

00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:33,530
like if you're doing some kind of like

00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:36,500
log analysis or something you have some

00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:38,210
tools blog or like chainsaw I guess you

00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:42,200
can you know you can look for these and

00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:46,450
have alerts on these and you know I

00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:46,450
don't know how effective it will be but

00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:59,869
yeah pretty much yeah I use grab or less

00:47:55,550 --> 00:48:01,460
normally yeah but yeah I mean if you

00:47:59,869 --> 00:48:04,700
have proactive things you'd look for the

00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:06,800
errors ahead of time and maybe like if

00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:08,990
you really i would probably narrow it

00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:12,770
down to like specific type of errors

00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:14,960
like if you care about like deploy vm

00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:16,880
failed then you can you know combining

00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:19,400
like the error with the type of task so

00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,230
you have alerts on specific you don't

00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,850
want to have alerts on like warren or

00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:26,030
something cuz you won't be able to sleep

00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:27,800
if you have major I guess then you want

00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:34,540
to like narrow it down as much as you

00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:34,540
can so there are any other questions

00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,920
