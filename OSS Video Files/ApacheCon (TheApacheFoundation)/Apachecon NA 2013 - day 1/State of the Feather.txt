so it now falls to me to introduce

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:10,320
our first speaker uh traditionally

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,160
the opening talk of apache con

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,840
uh to those of you who've had anything

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,960
at all to do with the apache software

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,359
foundation

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,520
that jim jagalski or jim jack should

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,920
need no introduction

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,680
so all i really need to say is please

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,519
welcome the president of the apache

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,119
software foundation to talk about the

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,840
state of the feather

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,840
jim jagelski

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,719
thank you steve good morning everyone

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,520
how are y'all doing this morning good

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,120
how many people

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,719
it's going to be hard to see but how

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,480
many people is this your first apache

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,360
con just raise your hand

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,920
that's fantastic that's great very cool

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,879
so

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,520
um as steve said there are a ton of

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,960
sessions

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,879
out there with a whole bunch of

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,480
different content uh

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,000
you'll meet people who actually develop

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,439
the code write the code

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,119
uh agonize over the code so be sure to

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,960
get the most out of it

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,360
what i'd like to do for the next half an

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,560
hour or so is just give what we call the

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,680
traditional state

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,720
of the feather talk this is basically a

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,360
short summary of the asf

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,400
and the uh what's been going on the last

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,799
year or so within the asf

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,880
um i'm using the word asf it stands for

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,759
the apache software foundation

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,640
some people just call us apache which is

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,720
fine

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,799
before there was the asf there was this

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,840
uh this group of uh

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,759
of people called the apache group and

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,720
basically the idea behind that is these

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,720
were people

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,280
who uh needed a working web server

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,399
mostly because their livelihoods

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,920
depended on it

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,079
so at the very very beginning you can

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,320
see that the asf was all about

00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,079
not only the um the sharing of code the

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,640
sharing of technology

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,640
but also the very fact that technology

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,840
impacted people's lives people's

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,000
livelihood

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,679
their jobs depended on it and that's one

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,920
of the reasons why the apache license is

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:15,280
written the way that it is

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,599
okay it wasn't until like about 1999 or

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,879
so

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,560
when ibm was looking at using

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,319
the apache web server for their web

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,680
server technology that we actually

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,239
became incorporated

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,000
as the apache software foundation now i

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,120
think what's important and what's unique

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,120
in the asf

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,239
is that it's 100 percent membership

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,800
based

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,160
we we do have sponsors but they don't

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,959
control the policy

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,959
or the direction of the code of the

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,239
foundation of projects

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,400
it really is 100 controlled by the

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,280
membership within the asf which i think

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,400
is very very uh

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,400
unique uh some of particulars of the asf

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,760
it is a nonprofit corporation so

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,680
everything we do

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,840
basically has to revolve around the

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,440
public good we're developing code

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,440
because

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,959
people need it people depend on it and

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,720
it's a charity that we're providing to

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,879
those people out there

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,239
for people who are interested in

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,800
donating

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,400
financial resources to the asf it's

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,120
called a 501c3

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,920
which means it's a it's tax exempt as i

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,920
said before

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,280
it is a volunteer organization we don't

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,159
pay anyone to work

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,000
on the actual code itself so no one who

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,280
is working here at the uh who

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,159
is at the asf is an asf member is an asf

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,040
contributor

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,159
gets a paycheck from the asf for

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,879
developing code

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,640
out there it is a very very uh

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,799
wide-ranging organization

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,959
we have people worldwide and you'll see

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,760
that especially when uh when nick talks

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,920
about his uh

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,200
apache wave talk you'll see how that

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,400
really impacts the

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,400
development mantra of the asf and why we

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,560
focus on things like mailing lists and

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,319
stuff like that

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,799
also what i think is unique within the

00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:00,239
asf is that the foundation

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:03,120
exists to be very very lightweight

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,360
we're there basically to allow the

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,360
coders the programmers the developers

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,120
to do what they want to do but not have

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,040
to worry about things like

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,159
infrastructure wiki uh legal aspects and

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,639
stuff like that

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,799
so we're there to basically provide the

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,440
the the resources to do your work

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,840
without being controlling or managing of

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,360
those resources

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,440
now back at the very beginning there

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,280
were only about 21 members or so

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,720
and we basically had two main projects

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,040
the apache web server

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,880
and concom itself and everything was

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,199
donated we didn't own anything we didn't

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,199
own

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,880
the servers we didn't have the the

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,560
co-location facilities

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,040
uh everything was donated by other

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,960
people nowadays

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,759
uh we have over 430 members these are

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,440
actual

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,960
uh you know members of the apache

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,600
software foundation

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,479
59 people who had been members and have

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,400
decided to

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,520
to go on and do other things and didn't

00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,280
want to uh

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,360
you know follow the the motion of the

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,400
asf and do things like voting and stuff

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,639
like that

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,759
and over 100 top level projects and

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,280
these are the uh

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,680
the projects and the committees that you

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,520
think about tomcat is a tlp

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,960
hadoop is a t uh tlp uh lucy and stuff

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,880
like that

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,479
we also have a mechanism for new

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,560
projects to enter in

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,720
to the asf which is called the incubator

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,160
project and right now we have about 40

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,600
or so projects which are in this

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,360
incubation stage

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,039
with the idea and the understanding that

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,560
the vast majority of those

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,639
will come up and become top level

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,800
projects we also have a

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,479
thing called a labs area which is

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,560
designed to basically be sort of like a

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,199
sandbox facility for developers out

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,800
there

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,720
and there are some projects in which

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,080
their job is done there's no more active

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,240
development being done on it

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,160
and these go into the attic and in the

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,639
background you kind of like see a a

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,800
small picture of what our infrastructure

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,720
looks like now

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,560
so as i said before the asf's mission is

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,759
basically to provide software for the

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,000
public good out there

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,880
and provide that foundation out there

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,919
okay

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,440
oops now if you go to any company they

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,360
always have this vision statement

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,800
you know this is what we're there to do

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,479
this is why we exist

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,240
and if you want to be pedantic this is

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,639
kind of like what our mission statement

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,759
is

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,360
is within the asf that's very very wordy

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,199
you can actually boil it down to two

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,440
main ideas first of all

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,120
community created code you'll see this

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,440
uh you know

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,120
this phrase a lot in a lot of places a

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,199
lot of write-ups and stuff like that

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,039
it really makes people assured to know

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,400
that the asf is about the community

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,360
aspects of code

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,960
okay there is a real uh restriction on

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,639
people who are poisonous

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,199
uh the idea is that what you need to

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,199
develop

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,319
is a healthy community around the code

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,039
and the code itself

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,400
will become very very good very healthy

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,759
very viable out there

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,360
and that's what the second point is is

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,919
that not only should the community be

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,800
great

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,960
but the code should be great as well now

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,560
it is basically membership based

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,960
individuals only people are voted in

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,919
and get married basically based on

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,919
themselves

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,440
not who they work for not for how long

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,880
they've been working on the project

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,720
but basically what they do it's

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,319
basically a meritocracy it's another

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,160
word you're here a lot out there

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,680
and the members nominate new members

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,479
that are coming on board we try to do

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,360
this

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,639
at least once a year in fact our bylaws

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,720
say you have to have a

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,560
members meeting every year we have been

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,039
trying to do it uh you know twice a year

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,160
but

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,759
fell away this year

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,599
this is kind of like the org chart of

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,120
what the asf is and there's basically

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,800
two tiers to it

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,560
on the left hand side you'll see what

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,639
people mostly think of the asf

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,720
which are the projects out there and you

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,440
can see that that's the team that's the

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,919
tier

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,599
responsible for the technical oversight

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,680
of the projects these are the people who

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,280
are doing the actual code development

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,199
figuring out the direction that the code

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,360
should go to and things like that

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,280
at the very very top level for lack of a

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,879
better term are the pmc members and

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,840
these are the people who actually

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,199
have binding votes on what patches go

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,280
into the code base

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,120
uh when releases are put out and things

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,479
like that and there's a larger group of

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,000
people called the committers and these

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,560
are people with commit access to the

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,919
code

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,680
these are people who are actually able

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,720
to physically touch the code

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,400
that's in their repository and the

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,840
natural process is that committers

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,759
become pmc members

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,080
because as they proven themselves as

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,000
they create merit about themselves

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,199
they become able to have this binding

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,639
vote inside there

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,400
and then finally there's contributors

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,440
patchers and users and stuff like that

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,200
that's all the development committee

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,440
for because we are a legal entity

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,159
because we are a corporation

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,599
and a non-profit entity there are some

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,479
legal aspects that we need to worry

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,240
about as well

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,760
and this is that the the organizational

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,399
oversight the stuff on the right-hand

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,080
side

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,760
and those are the members the people

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,959
were actually voted in as members of the

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,440
asf

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,560
the officers of the asf every top level

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,360
project

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,000
has a chair position and this person

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,320
basically

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,399
serves as the eyes and ears on the board

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,640
their main function is basically to

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,880
send a quarterly report to the board

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,600
saying this is how the project's doing

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,440
this is how many new committers we have

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,600
these are the releases we've done

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,800
um are there any legal issues and things

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,240
like that you'll notice

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,480
it doesn't focus at all on the

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,680
development aspects of it it doesn't ask

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,120
the board for

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,600
okay we're thinking about adding this

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,800
feature is that okay that control is one

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,040
hundred percent on the

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,000
on the communities out there and finally

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,839
the board uh

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,200
the nine member board is there to

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,240
basically ensure

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,680
the legal aspects of the foundation run

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,320
now even though we've been around for a

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,880
long period of time policy is still

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,600
firmly in the hands of the individuals

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,480
out there

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,040
we have really restricted and and held

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,360
back

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,399
against things like executive directors

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,760
and things like that

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,800
for the fear that that person's vision

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,440
may not match

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,560
all of our vision out there and so by

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,680
making sure that

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,240
the board and the uh the membership

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,480
are 100 percent individuals and ensures

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,200
that we keep control of our own destiny

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,720
out there

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,560
now we do unfortunately we're

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,040
fortunately have the ability

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,320
to have outsourced help now as you can

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,800
tell by that slide

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,720
a while ago our infrastructure is huge

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,720
it's very very complex we're supporting

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,640
over 100 top level projects

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,920
there's a lot of bits and pieces inside

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,920
there and so we have an

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,839
excellent infrastructure team who is

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,519
focused and dedicated on keeping that

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,519
up and running out there now we have

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,000
three full-time uh you know assisted

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,160
men's

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,040
who are doing a great job in in doing

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,320
that we also have a part-time executive

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,959
assistant melissa

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,640
who helps out with the with the minutia

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,959
of running such a large large

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,399
organization and without this outsourced

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,720
help we really wouldn't be able to do

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,640
the kind of stuff we're doing but again

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,760
the focus is that that's on the

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,040
infrastructure part

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,279
it doesn't leak over into the

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,640
development part

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,800
so basically the board and the

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,720
infrastructure exists so projects

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,480
don't need to worry about it okay the

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,000
board runs the foundation

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,480
but the projects run the codes

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,320
themselves now over the last year we've

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,120
seen a lot of activity

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,760
and in general the pmcs are very very

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,680
healthy

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,160
i mean we're seeing a lot of new

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,240
releases a lot of new developers

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,519
a lot of interest in the code both

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,839
internal to the asf

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,680
but also more importantly external to

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,320
the asf out there there are a lot of

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,360
people

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,920
who really want to play with the fun

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,760
stuff

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,200
that we develop out there and not only

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,760
do people want to play with it

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,680
and develop it there are large scale

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,360
enterprises who want to use it who are

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,279
depending on it and that's really

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,760
something which is that's a true feather

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,320
in our cap out there we also have new

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,600
podlings being added these are projects

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,600
which um like what the asf is doing

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,720
like how we manage uh communities like

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,560
how we you know the

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,079
the methods that we have for developing

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,600
projects out there and they want to

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,440
become part of our family

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,120
cloud stack is most probably the best

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,200
example of that within the last month

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,639
i mean the last year of a really cool

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,040
prodling who wanted to come

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,880
into the asf and now we also have

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,959
projects which are graduating

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,800
from the incubator to top-level projects

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,800
an open office is a great example of

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,079
that as well

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,720
and also the asf continues to be

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,279
recognized both within the open source

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,240
community

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,519
as well as external as a free and open

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,360
source software leader

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,720
you know despite the fact that we don't

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,839
try to

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,480
market ourselves as that you know the

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,040
message

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,560
the the reason why we're being as as uh

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,720
as looked up to

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,320
is simply because the results of every

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,399
contributor every member

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,240
every developer who's working on the asf

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,800
code and that's really the

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,920
the real proof now we did have a

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,040
membership meeting

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,200
a few months ago and added 49

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,200
new members which i think is probably

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,800
the the largest group that we've ever

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,839
elected in inside there we do have a new

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,360
board

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,959
nine people and you'll see the list of

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,720
people all the way up there

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,880
over the last month you can see just the

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,680
number of top level projects which of

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,839
either

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,680
which have graduated from the um the

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,160
incubator or have spun off into other

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,079
projects

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,240
there it's just in the last 12 months

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,279
that's what what two maybe three or so

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,240
a month of projects you know coming on

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,880
board

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,360
we had uh you know a budget that we uh

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,320
you know

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,639
are holding to in fact uh for any you

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,560
know

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,839
uh pmc people out there i'll be calling

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,920
for a budget call

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,279
most probably in in the next of the week

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,720
uh we had a

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:37,279
part-time system who uh we were able to

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,040
bring up to full-time status um also

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:42,000
what's important is that

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,600
uh the number of projects and incubated

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,959
problems which are using git

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,199
has really significantly increased

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,720
you're seeing that a lot now and despite

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,279
the claims to the contrary

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,639
the world did not end with the git

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,440
experiment which is really really

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,360
fantastic

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,120
so if you ever hear any fud about you

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,360
know the asf doesn't allow git

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,839
that is subversion only that's don't

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,079
even worry about

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,880
we do have some some new officers on

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,199
board

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,800
those are the lists out there um doug is

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,680
the the chairman and i'm the president

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,320
you'll see uh

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,720
the other officers up there as well we

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,120
also

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,560
ensure that all legal protection

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,600
required by projects

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,480
is is available as i said before the asf

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,279
is really really producing software that

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,600
is used by

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,519
a large variety of commercial entities

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,480
out there they wouldn't be doing it if

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,760
we were

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,040
um you know kind of lacking in doing the

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,199
kind of protection that we wanted to

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,639
they weren't able to follow the ip

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,160
protection and stuff like that

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,160
we need to also protect the brands and

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,560
the trademarks okay

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,600
now we've been doing this for 14 years

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,600
and it's a long time

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,680
okay so we must be doing something right

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,680
now certainly we're not perfect

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,800
you know we do have this focus on on

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,800
community

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,240
which is great but i certainly think we

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,199
can do a lot better

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,160
you know just it it's obvious looking

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,519
out over the

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,720
the crowd that we have uh problems

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,720
shared with a lot of open source

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,440
communities out there regarding uh

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,720
diversity

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,880
especially gender-based and i think

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,240
that's something that the asf can really

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,680
be a true leader

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,680
in showing the open source community the

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,120
way to do that especially with a

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,040
community and an

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,720
organization which is based on merit

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,279
which is supposedly blind to everything

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,480
else

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,320
i think we need to be able to do a

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,199
better job as far as that the other

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,399
thing is we don't claim to be

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,880
the right solution for every project out

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,240
there

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,240
in the same way that we don't claim the

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,560
apache license to be the best license

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,680
for all software out there okay we just

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,160
happen to have a method

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,040
methodology that has been shown to to

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,519
work for us

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,279
okay it may not work for you chances are

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,519
it will if you give it a try

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,519
now this whole methodology is something

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,240
that we call the apache way

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,800
and it really is um something which has

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,199
grown up

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,000
over the uh the last 14 years you know

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,399
and it really was

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,519
based on the idea that individuals are

00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,440
important

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,680
merit is important and healthy

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,720
communities and nick burch is actually

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,279
doing a talk

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,000
uh right after the the keynotes this

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,519
morning

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,680
about the apache way and i really

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,120
encourage people that if you have any

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,199
kind of interest or

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,680
curiosity about exactly what that apache

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,160
way is please go into it okay

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,000
and watch it and finally i like to go

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,079
and thank all of our sponsors these are

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,440
the actual asf sponsors in addition

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:27,519
to apache con having sponsors uh these

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,680
these are people who basically uh

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,240
provide funds to the asf

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,959
no strings attached you guys know what

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,279
to do with it

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:40,480
we we value what your entity does please

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:43,360
hold on yeah that's about that

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,000
yeah i just forgot we just brought in

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,320
intel

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,800
as a brand new platinum sponsor

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,279
basically just earlier this week so in

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,279
addition

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,519
so in addition to such luminaries as

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,680
citrix and facebook and google we have

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,640
people like intel again this is another

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,679
sign of the kind of of trust and

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,480
reputation

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,360
that the asf is able to enjoy in those

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,120
organizations

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,280
and also in keeping with our sort of

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,559
like you know behind the scenes things

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,520
we don't even go out there and encourage

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,240
people to

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,360
people come to us you know i mean that

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,400
it's it's it's

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:27,120
it's part of our dna you know as much as

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,679
you know people think that you know uh

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,840
you know

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,600
asf people enjoy being up on stage we

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,679
really don't we enjoy the message we

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,919
don't enjoy the experience per se

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,679
but the reason why we do it is because

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,480
we really like what's going on with the

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,280
asf

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,960
you know we always let our our code and

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,600
our documentation stuff like that speak

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,760
for us

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,039
so again thank you to all our sponsors

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,799
thank you for the trust they even

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,480
they've invested with us

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,400
i'd like to provide a tip of the hat to

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,799
other people who have who have helped us

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,640
out

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,400
with codification facilities and

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,600
software and servers and things like

00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,360
that

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,280
and finally a big thank you to to

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,799
everyone who

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,679
uses touches commits any

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,400
asf code chances are very good everyone

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,120
is doing it

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,120
asf apache code is pervasive in the

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,919
marketplace out there okay

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,679
and again community created code isn't a

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,160
slogan it really isn't

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,120
it really is the way we operate it is

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,320
part of our core

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,600
dna okay and when you think about open

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,320
source when you think about free

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,400
software

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,960
that really needs to be the core aspect

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,760
it certainly is is fundamental to us

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,240
is that we are all in this together we

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,960
are all based on our individuality

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,120
and that's what's important to all of us

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,520
so finally uh i'd like to you know close

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,840

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,960
if there are any problems at all please

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,760
let someone know

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,559
we want this to be a fun friendly safe

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,200
absolutely

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,720

please contact anyone okay provide

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,360
feedback for speakers it's very very

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,480
important okay getting that kind of you

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,480
know feedback loop

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,720
is crucially important when developing

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,720
code okay that's the reason why you want

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,080
users and developers to communicate

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,760
drastically because

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,280
the code will get better when you get

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,200
that feedback loop from the users

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,720
same thing with speakers okay any

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,360
