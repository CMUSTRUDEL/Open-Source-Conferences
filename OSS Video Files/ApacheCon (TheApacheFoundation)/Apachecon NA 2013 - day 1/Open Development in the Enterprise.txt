should wait until you hear me for that

00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:12,750
so this is a version seven point forty

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,610
two if you've been to my any of my

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,109
previous talks in this track in the

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,020
previous conferences it's pretty much

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,670
the same thing it's like love songs you

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,279
know you you always say the same thing

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,330
and is in a slightly different way so

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:30,109
i'll try to be a creative about that

00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:33,570
what changed in between so i've been

00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:37,110
talking about this this stuff you know

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:40,170
how do you apply the open-source way of

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,930
thinking and tools in business been

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,629
talking about that for the last lots of

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,300
years initially i was independent so I

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,340
was a one-man shop and then I got hired

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,399
by day software Switzerland which was

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:57,270
150 people and we got acquired by Adobe

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,370
10,000 folks so it's it's it's been a

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,370
change for my for you know my

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,799
professional life and I try to to relate

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,409
to that so I'm a senior developer in the

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,960
adobe CQ 5 team that cq5 is a

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:13,140
large-scale content management product

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,460
and when basel switzerland i actually

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,590
live in Lausanne which is the

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,799
french-speaking part and Basel is a

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,060
German speaking part but we are friends

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,820
I'm a member of the foundation and

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,729
currently on the board of directors my

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,979
slides already on SlideShare so as a

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:34,140
reward for typing my name you can see my

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:36,390
slides and follow along if you want just

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,220
a small disclaimer or this you know

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,170
adobe is 10,000 people that's a big

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,450
thing you cannot get everybody to agree

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,479
on this stuff so I'm not speaking

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,220
officially about Adobe's position on

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,470
that it's my view on things and I'm

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,100
trying to push it within Adobe with some

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,140
success it's a as I said you only you

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,479
will not get everybody to agree but we

00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,689
have been influencing some other groups

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:04,549
with this stuff and that's that's a good

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:07,820
thing I'm very jet-lagged landing on

00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:10,429
Sunday crashed and will

00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,410
I am well rested so I'm still pretty

00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:15,290
much on Swiss time so bear with me I'll

00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:19,040
try to be maybe not entertaining but at

00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:21,140
least alive for the next hour we have an

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,900
hour which is should be plenty so don't

00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:27,110
hesitate if you have questions

00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:29,630
observations to raise your hand so can

00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:33,170
you do open the rope on the inside a

00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:35,390
business inside a big company by open

00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:38,810
the weapon I'll explain that in more

00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:42,050
detail I mean working like open source

00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:44,420
projects which is if you are involved in

00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:48,650
Apache projects it's often fairly

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:53,180
chaotic lots of discussions and it's not

00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:57,260
always easy and in businesses there's a

00:02:53,180 --> 00:03:00,470
tendency to be to have secrets sometimes

00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,820
you need to but for some some type of

00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,130
stuff you don't really need to and

00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,410
within the team I think it's not a good

00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:08,660
idea to have secrets you want your team

00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:14,060
to share their wisdom their knowledge

00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:16,100
and soul share that openly and also who

00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,989
cares if your code is not yet perfect as

00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,580
no one was saying that in the previous

00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:21,709
talk about documentation is never

00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,720
finished code is never finished and

00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:26,480
sometimes people don't want to share it

00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,010
because it's ugly I don't want to commit

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,380
my code because not it's not finished

00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:34,640
it's never finished pretty much so I

00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:37,010
think these these arguments against open

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,480
development don't don't stand for me I

00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:44,269
think I try to explain that sharing and

00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,000
having a culture of sharing and flow of

00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:51,880
sharing information all the time is very

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,380
beneficial for your teams in businesses

00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,810
corporate teams are often look like that

00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,570
you have you know small pots so it's

00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:02,930
more silos and each team they don't talk

00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:05,090
to each other what one story about that

00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,700
which is interesting when we shortly

00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:09,090
after we we will get acquired by Adobe I

00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,900
was working on

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,160
on testing tools for slaying slang is

00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,690
doesn't matter what it is for this

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,239
discussion it's what it's an Apache

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,760
project it's an application layer 44

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,880
content management and I was working on

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:26,250
interesting I think testing tools for

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,570
that so I've made some noise about it on

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:32,820
my blog and some places and also in

00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,620
internal technical mailing list and I

00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,600
got three different people from three

00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,030
different areas of the company contacted

00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,700
me saying it had a phone that's cool I'm

00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,650
working pretty much on the same thing so

00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,880
these guys were each working you know in

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,950
three different parts of the company

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,300
working on the same stuff duplicating

00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,930
what the others were doing pretty much

00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,190
not sharing and by putting it outside

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,290
putting in a public place it could all

00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:57,180
see it and collaborate and and we got

00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:00,360
great contributions from from these

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,340
folks so I think the when you have a big

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,930
organization it's inevitable that you

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,210
will have some separation between the

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,699
groups also because of cultural time

00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:11,729
zones there's lots of things that tend

00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:14,430
to to foster that separation but you you

00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:17,300
need to try to to you know five days and

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:23,250
and get people together on cross-cutting

00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:25,530
topics so creating a flow of information

00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:28,710
is what you want if everybody is

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:30,990
drinking from the same river the

00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:33,570
bacteria will spread and maybe the good

00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,370
stuff as well you know so that that's

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:38,639
what you want you want this flow of

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,740
information I'm not a fan of meeting I'm

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,510
a mostly a telecommuter because I live

00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,700
on the other side of Switzerland it's a

00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:48,990
three hours commute to go to buzzer so I

00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:51,630
don't go there very often and but even

00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,880
if you're in the same building meetings

00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,919
can be great when they're about vision

00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,840
and you know really putting neurons

00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,940
together if you have a meeting about

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,190
sharing information it's mostly ways of

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,110
time if it's you know kind of status

00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:06,630
information that should be flowing all

00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,639
the time and that's what we that's what

00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:10,710
we have an open source in our Apache

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,229
projects people all work in different

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,160
time zones they're also from different

00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:16,560
cultures that

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,720
from different companies that that's a

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,820
really recipe for failure you could if

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,820
you study our project said this is going

00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:26,730
to fail and yet many of our projects

00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:29,580
pull out excellent release is regularly

00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:31,890
so this is working and I think it's this

00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:38,040
flow of information that makes a

00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:42,960
difference oops wrong direction towards

00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:45,870
jet lag so the way we work so did this

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,760
started at this this company day

00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,880
software so they software was his

00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,760
company as I said about 150 people when

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,550
we got acquired exists it for 15 years

00:06:53,760 --> 00:07:00,540
but it remained very much like a

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:03,090
start-up the way it operates and we have

00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,410
tried to keep that in our group even

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:09,230
though we're now part of a larger

00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:11,940
company there was obviously some people

00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:13,380
who thought we should change you know

00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,270
you're in a big company now so you

00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,880
cannot do the same thing anymore and we

00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:19,950
fought that and it's pretty much working

00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,310
we had to adjust some of our processes

00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:26,250
obviously but basically we we we could

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:30,860
keep the same the same setup in the same

00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:34,860
way of working so we put a lot of

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:37,830
emphasis on the issue tracker one of the

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,990
the principles is that if you're working

00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:42,330
on something it must be an issue in the

00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,160
tracker if you're working on a you know

00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:46,260
you if I asked you what why you're doing

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,140
what are you working on today shouldn't

00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:52,950
tell me that you know the memory bug of

00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:54,570
the the sorting of the indexes it should

00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:58,200
be able to give me a tracker issue

00:07:54,570 --> 00:08:00,840
number i'm working on CQ dash 1 2 3 4

00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,790
and that's that's a very precise

00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,770
reference to something in this tracker

00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:06,810
you get one page where you have the

00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,640
history of this feature and that's

00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,770
that's an excellent communication

00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,210
mechanism it makes sure you speak about

00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,940
the same thing which is not always

00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:17,580
obvious when you're in a group

00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:20,710
especially in distributed group and also

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:23,560
you by using this you right

00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:26,170
history of your project as you go so we

00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,930
put a lot of importance on this l only

00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:30,580
screenshot it says steven or bugzilla we

00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,470
have something more modern now we're

00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,440
working with JIRA doesn't really matter

00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:37,630
which one you use even this clunky

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,520
bugzilla was working pretty well for us

00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:41,500
we couldn't upgrade it because we had

00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,600
customized it which was a big mistake

00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,190
then we couldn't follow the upgrades so

00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,960
we were still working at the time with a

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:50,380
note bugzilla but it was take good

00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,420
enough it's it it's more important to

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,450
use it done exactly what it what it does

00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:58,630
so and we we use and abuse the issue

00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:00,730
tracker if I need a server setup I will

00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,040
create an issue in the tracker and

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,470
that's you know with everything that

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,300
needs collaboration coordination we use

00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:09,820
the tracker for that so it's not only

00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,940
for bugs it's also for features test

00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:16,080
setups whatever so that's that's the key

00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:20,860
point in our collaboration set up and

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:25,900
then you need obviously on a single code

00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:27,460
repository we're working currently my

00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,740
group and a number of other groups that

00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,990
other we are working with get it works

00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:35,350
very well for us could be subversion

00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:37,510
could be even CVS if you need it may be

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,880
a bit obsolete now but it would still

00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:42,250
work what's important is that you have

00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,500
again a central point where your code

00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:47,620
goes and your code should be

00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,510
discoverable in that one thing that

00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,430
works pretty well in the apache software

00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:54,040
foundation we have hundred fifty

00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:56,440
projects it's not easy to keep track of

00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:59,530
what they do you know even though i'm a

00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,390
board member you could probably tell me

00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:03,190
of about 50 of these projects and i

00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,320
wouldn't know what they are on what what

00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,850
do you do but still it's very easy to

00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,740
find the information because you have a

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:11,170
standard structure you know that the

00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,180
through Apache project will be at food

00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,860
at Apache dot org that's their homepage

00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,380
and this should link to the mailing list

00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:21,340
to the rest of the information so have

00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:23,590
any kind of standard way of discovering

00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:26,290
the projects and discovering their code

00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,360
is extremely useful today in the talks

00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,060
when when

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,570
I hear people talking quite often I go

00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:35,519
to svn search dot org I think and I look

00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:37,350
up their name you know if Isabelle is

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,959
talking in next talk or what what's is

00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,670
about doing so you can look up on svn

00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:43,589
surgeons and see where she's been

00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:46,200
committing oh she was like him in this

00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:48,180
project five years ago now she's active

00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,880
on this project it's all discoverable

00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,920
it's all open so for us Apache it's

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,870
obvious because we an open organization

00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,140
you can also do the same thing in your

00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:00,990
business and have you know open

00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:03,149
discoverable code repositories where

00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:06,300
people can find stuff without having to

00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:09,060
ask and that the self-service notion is

00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,910
also very important then on the left

00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:14,100
side we have an activity stream it's

00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:16,440
nothing fancy this morning there was a

00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,630
talk about streams that I found pretty

00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,180
interesting but it's not even that but

00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:23,850
it's more like a conceptual stream so it

00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,560
could be just email subscriptions to

00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,720
what happens and then you will get

00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,480
emails whenever someone commits code

00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,329
whenever an issue changes state an issue

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,040
is created and so on any kind of stream

00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:37,890
that allows you to follow the action is

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,290
extremely useful means also that you can

00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:42,930
subscribe to the events that you are

00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,730
interested in what's going on and and

00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:47,940
see the action so it means also that

00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:50,040
project managers can make queries in the

00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,290
tracker they can see the events they can

00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,329
see the amount of activity it gives a

00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:58,199
very interesting information and this is

00:11:54,329 --> 00:12:01,500
all this flow of of you know important

00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:04,380
but not extremely complex information

00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,329
it's all small events and it's important

00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:09,149
to have them if you need meetings for

00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:11,959
that that's ways of time you know this

00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:14,910
should be discoverable and queryable if

00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:18,029
the tracker is up to date because

00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:20,760
everybody is working on an issue at any

00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:22,380
time then it's easy to find out where we

00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,329
are look at look at the tracker make

00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,660
queries see how many issues are still

00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:29,940
open see see how they're moving so this

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,760
is the basic setup which creates a

00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:35,690
shared knowledge base we'd see that this

00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:38,630
information is is then searchable

00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:41,870
and allows you to look up which also

00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:44,420
brings the importance of email down and

00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:47,290
that's a very important point big

00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:49,730
companies tend to have you know

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:51,950
employees of big companies i would say

00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:54,860
tend to use email as their knowledge

00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:56,630
base you know your email client is your

00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,460
knowledge base what happens when you

00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:00,710
leave well now or what happens when you

00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:03,050
join when you join the company you have

00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:04,550
an empty email inbox so you have an

00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:07,130
empty knowledge base it's not very

00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:09,800
useful if the information is in this

00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:12,200
centralized system it's much easier to

00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,600
find out you can resync you can take

00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,760
your time to look at issues look at the

00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,220
events look at the code repository and

00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,560
find the information by by yourself so

00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,870
we tend to we try to down down play the

00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:27,080
email as much as possible and say that

00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:30,950
email should be mostly throw away and

00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:33,020
that's in Apache it's similar email is

00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:34,850
important because we say if it didn't

00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:37,400
happen on a dev least it didn't happen

00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:39,530
but email is meant to create the

00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:42,170
consensus and then the contestant

00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:45,170
consensus will be recorded by creating

00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:47,900
an issue by creating code etc so email

00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:49,970
is important it's not it's not the core

00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,980
of the information system and I think

00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:55,310
that that's good and this then enables

00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:57,560
you to to put the meetings that you have

00:13:55,310 --> 00:14:00,290
it so it's a great luxury to be able to

00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,690
have meetings if you have a if your team

00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:04,790
is co-located but if you can bring these

00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:07,130
meetings to the next level of actually

00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:09,770
discussing the vision that the long-term

00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:11,390
stuff or the design of the software it's

00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:13,340
much more interesting than exchanging

00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:16,010
information like what did you do last

00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:18,380
week that's that's the kind of boring

00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:23,290
meetings that I don't like so this is a

00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:25,820
setup centralized hub of issues code and

00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:28,310
discussions that also CAG I didn't show

00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:32,710
that here but we also use mailing lists

00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:36,800
in our teams like we do in Apache the

00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:39,530
goals of that set up our that's for

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,880
girls and that's this yeah as I said the

00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:44,780
same for pictures that I've been using

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,280
for the last few years hasn't changed

00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:48,800
the goals are to establish a shared

00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:51,290
vision that's extremely important in the

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,940
project group that first everybody

00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:56,150
should have the same idea of what you're

00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:58,040
doing you can try the experiment ask two

00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:00,770
people in the project what they're doing

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,750
and it you can get fairly different

00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:05,270
answers sometimes so you will try to

00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:07,310
create a shared vision about what is it

00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:09,950
that we're doing you will try to have

00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:12,380
real-time status updates this is this

00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,570
activity stream that was mentioning so

00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:17,090
be able to follow in real-time what's

00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:19,040
happening in the project one code is

00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:23,150
committed when issues advance to the

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:25,580
next step and so on you also would like

00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:27,740
to be able to broadcast help requests

00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:30,290
there's a tendency where you have an

00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,990
established team to say Oh doesn't oh

00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:34,700
there's a memory problem that's what Bob

00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:37,040
is the king of memory problems so we'll

00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,740
ask him it's good if it's here

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,360
unavailable but it's also very powerful

00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,910
if you can just put the problem out

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,490
there say we have a memory problem who

00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:49,070
feels like tackling this today because

00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:51,470
it's urgent and maybe you know bill

00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:53,600
today feels like oh yeah today I'm in

00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:55,640
good mood so I want to tackle a hard

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,110
memory problem and he might be more

00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,540
efficient because he wants to do this

00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:01,820
today so the idea is did too to

00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:05,210
broadcast the help request to the group

00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:08,270
may be saying okay I think that's Bob

00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:10,220
that should be attacking this problem if

00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:12,320
someone else wants to do that now just

00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:16,550
grab the issue assign it to yourself and

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:19,550
do it and then the fourth key point here

00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:22,160
is to create searchable archives of this

00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:24,290
material so whatever happens in this

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,870
system should be archived and searchable

00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:29,510
so that people who join your team can

00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:31,370
get up to speed in self service without

00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:33,650
having to ask about the basic

00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:35,480
information of course you will if you

00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:37,160
need to work on something will you will

00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,020
need to ask the people to get the

00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,520
details but that is the basic

00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,950
information should be available in

00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:45,980
insert service and that's what we have

00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:48,600
in in Apache so the shared vision we

00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,790
establish it by saying the dev list is

00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,980
it should happen so whatever you discuss

00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,990
you know if you don't discuss it on a

00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,480
dev list or you're on the side on the

00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:59,160
erase it doesn't count so the rest is

00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,800
where you can establish this shared

00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,679
vision the real-time status updates all

00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:07,140
these events in Apache it's also usually

00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:09,089
mailing list it could be an RSS feed it

00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,789
could be different types of events but

00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:14,520
if you are like a comet or activity list

00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:16,709
that that works as well the help

00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,750
requests are broadcast by way of the

00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:21,120
tracker by creating an issue in the

00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:23,100
tracker everybody can subscribe and be

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,289
aware of what's happening on the search

00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,929
horrible archives happen because you

00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:30,510
index or the system's index this data

00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:33,770
and make it searchable more or less the

00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:36,570
mailing list search is not very precise

00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:39,870
one thing about the mailing lists is you

00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:43,110
know the quoting people unfortunately

00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:45,600
this is going away but all the time

00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:47,940
Apache folks tend to be very precise in

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,159
how they quote messages when when you

00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,080
reply and there's a very good reason for

00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:54,270
that that it gives much more value to

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,919
the archives because in the archive you

00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:57,539
have exactly the question the answer you

00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,240
know what what happened when you do the

00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:02,250
top posting you have the whole junk that

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,049
that's still here which means that the

00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,760
same message will be repeated 10 times

00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,950
in the archives and the search archives

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,850
you read don't take that into account so

00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:13,559
it makes this search much less powerful

00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:15,000
unfortunately this the mobile devices

00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,010
are driving this it's much harder on a

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,030
tablet to do the precise quoting that

00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:24,299
that that we used to do so that's I hope

00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:25,919
we can we can overcome that the dr the

00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:27,630
archive system should be able to do that

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,510
like you know gmail does that very well

00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:33,720
hiding the common policy in messages but

00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:36,900
they archives usually don't do it so

00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,090
let's look at this this topics in a bit

00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,970
more detail how do you establish this

00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:44,340
shared vision on the left you have what

00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:47,100
very often happens in in corporate

00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:49,140
settings is a one-to-one email you know

00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,820
that Bob is the king of memory problems

00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,980
so when you have a memory problem you

00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:56,010
send an email to Bob that's a bad idea

00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:58,119
because others won't see it and just

00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:00,009
being aware of what's going on

00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:02,349
or we have lots of memory problems these

00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:04,059
days we you know we influenced your

00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:06,639
developers they will know should be

00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:08,799
careful about that or if I suspect

00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:12,309
there's one in the modular should I have

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:15,729
a look so the the right solution is to

00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:18,879
have this central hub and always use the

00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:21,249
dev list to to communicate about

00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:24,219
technical issues we do that in the

00:19:21,249 --> 00:19:26,139
projects where I'm active at Adobe it

00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:27,939
was a bit of a culture change for some

00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:30,849
of our colleagues to see you know it's

00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:33,759
it's I'm getting 200 messages a day it's

00:19:30,849 --> 00:19:36,879
not possible and yes it is possible i

00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:38,619
wrote the code that the large meaning is

00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:40,929
survival guide for form of our

00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:43,529
colleagues you know be careful we

00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:46,749
extremely careful about the subjects of

00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:49,059
your emails that that that's the key

00:19:46,749 --> 00:19:51,159
then you can vary scheme very quickly on

00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:54,189
the subject lines you know my client say

00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:55,749
oh no I'm not interested click click

00:19:54,189 --> 00:19:57,879
click click oh this one is interesting

00:19:55,749 --> 00:20:01,209
because the subject tells me that I

00:19:57,879 --> 00:20:03,159
should read it so I between the Apache

00:20:01,209 --> 00:20:07,719
projects and the adobe projects a

00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:10,359
process maybe 300 messages a day process

00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:13,449
Adam Reed 300 messages a day I read may

00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:15,489
be 10 but by skimming the subjects very

00:20:13,449 --> 00:20:17,649
quickly you can you can process a lot of

00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:19,839
email and that's efficient and you still

00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:21,519
see the other things so is still aware

00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,859
of what's going on you know really light

00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:26,339
like a vague chatter in the room you

00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:29,459
hear it but you don't need to pay

00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:32,619
precise attention to it and it doesn't

00:20:29,459 --> 00:20:34,899
take your energy so by moving from a

00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:39,009
one-to-one email to a central hub like a

00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:42,039
dare list or you know Stack Overflow

00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:45,189
kind of thing or whatever but a central

00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:47,139
thing you will make this communication

00:20:45,189 --> 00:20:49,209
much more efficient you will see what

00:20:47,139 --> 00:20:51,999
going what's going on but it requires

00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:54,489
discipline ya like it like this precise

00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:56,859
quoting an email being careful about

00:20:54,489 --> 00:20:59,199
your subject lines because more effort

00:20:56,859 --> 00:21:01,449
from from the people who are writing the

00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:05,020
messages but it's it's really worth it

00:21:01,449 --> 00:21:07,420
in the long term and also

00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:10,480
if it's important it should have a URL

00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:12,430
should have a permanent URL if I'm

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,340
writing more than three paragraphs in an

00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:17,800
email I start to think it does it does

00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,510
this really belong here that is not

00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,850
something that should go on wiki or

00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:23,920
issue somewhere and then just send an

00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:25,720
email at points to that say hey look at

00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,230
the issue that I created can you comment

00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,970
there or something I'm not saying you

00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:34,270
should never send an email more than

00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:36,910
three paragraphs but it's usually it can

00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:39,220
be a bad sign it can mean that something

00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:42,370
that deserves a better better space that

00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:44,650
email is going on and at least any yet

00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:47,080
any information that is meant to stay

00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:49,720
should have a permanent URL like you get

00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:53,230
in a wiki or in the tracker or an email

00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:55,240
archive something like that basically

00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,760
you're creating you creating a hub and

00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:00,670
spoke model instead of one to one

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,560
communications you have n to n by

00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:04,810
sending messages to a central place

00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,370
everybody sees everything that's a lot

00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:09,550
of traffic you need to get used to that

00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:11,830
and you need to be careful about what

00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:14,290
you write think twice before sending a

00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:18,100
message and so on same thing for the

00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:22,840
source code the source code should be

00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:25,420
should be shared readwrite that's we

00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:29,130
have version control systems for reason

00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:32,170
it's very easy to revert something so

00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:35,710
I'm not for being too conservative about

00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:37,690
to gets right writes the technical

00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:40,180
Wright's for writing in the code then

00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:42,070
there might be a social right we've also

00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:45,550
been discussing that in Apache recently

00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:46,990
so we shall we open all the Apache code

00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:50,320
repositories to everybody in the

00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:52,180
foundation why not and then you know

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,970
that you know you know I have no clue

00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:56,860
I've no clue about how Hadoop works so i

00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:58,990
won't going to Hadoop and make changes

00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:01,360
and if I do it people can revert it

00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:03,700
revert it and tell me okay please don't

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,040
do it and if I do it three times maybe

00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:08,410
they will block me in the end but you

00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,780
could have a social layer of control on

00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:12,820
top of the the technical layer but at

00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,570
least the code should be writable by

00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,390
everybody

00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:18,970
and discoverable meaning searchable and

00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:22,900
use conventions for the project names

00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:25,240
and so on another important thing in

00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:28,330
this communication is to what I could

00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:31,000
speak in your eyes when you so instead

00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:32,740
of talking about the memory problem you

00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,810
know maybe right now we know exactly

00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,580
what it is because we five of us we're

00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:38,590
working on that so we know what the

00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,000
memory problem is if you look at the

00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:42,400
archive two months later you have no

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,440
clue which memory problem was that you

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,390
know if you use an issue number for

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,010
example C Q dash one two three four it's

00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:50,380
very precise you know what it is it's

00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:52,630
not to compete URL but it's a decent

00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:54,580
convention that maps to complete URL

00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:58,030
it's obvious for everybody what that

00:23:54,580 --> 00:24:00,000
means same thing for main messages if

00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:02,770
you want to refer to a previous mail

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,950
please avoid saying you know in the

00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:07,870
other thread which other thread right

00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:09,670
now it's obvious in two weeks into

00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:12,490
months it's gone so if you can give a

00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:14,850
reference to that it's much better same

00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:17,710
for the for the code code revisions

00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:20,530
you're saying if you're saying this

00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:21,820
works on the current trunk and 22 months

00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,230
from now the current wrong is totally

00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:25,150
different so if you can give you a

00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:27,600
revision number that's much more precise

00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:30,640
you don't need to do that every time but

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,580
it's good it's good to ask ask yourself

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,040
you know should I put an identifier in

00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:39,010
this message so that it stays longer and

00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:42,160
if you do that in issues in commit

00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:44,320
comments everywhere you create very rich

00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,450
web of links between this information

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:50,800
then it gives much more much more value

00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:59,410
to your archives so this is about the

00:24:50,800 --> 00:25:00,760
this central hub of communication the

00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:05,100
next step is to implement these

00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:07,720
real-time updates which will help

00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,790
managers know what's going on you know

00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,640
the people who have to answer where can

00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:14,860
we ship if you have a good issue tracker

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,010
management and you have small issues

00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:18,980
granular

00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:21,680
comic it's much easier to find out it's

00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:23,840
also much easier to reassign things in a

00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:26,420
crisis when shipping date is tomorrow

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,940
and you have a hundred issues left and

00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:31,010
you are maybe 50 people working on it so

00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:32,960
it's totally possible to do it but if

00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:35,540
you have already assigned the issues to

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,420
everybody in a fixed way and someone has

00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:40,820
20 issues they won't get it in one day

00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,980
so it doesn't work so by having small

00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:45,170
issues in a trucker you can reassign

00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:47,210
them fairly easily what people can look

00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:49,040
at them and say what can you do until

00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:52,460
tomorrow what issues would you like to

00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:55,190
work on what you feel on what you feel

00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:57,080
like working on now and if you work on

00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,940
something that you shows yourself you'll

00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,830
be much more efficient because at that

00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:04,070
you know I want you to work on that so I

00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:07,280
do it so being able to reassign this is

00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:09,410
is very useful and then you that's also

00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:12,280
a big contribution to these real-time

00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:15,640
updates so where you have the tracker

00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:18,290
the code repository and the email

00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,720
discussions feeding this activity stream

00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:24,110
which can be as simple as a mailing list

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,390
called activity at whatever your project

00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:29,570
name is or more sophisticated like you

00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:31,820
are like RSS or whatever makes sense but

00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:34,310
the idea is to have the real-time feeds

00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:36,770
of what happens and then people can

00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:40,040
subscribe to that or not that will also

00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:41,950
generate a lot of information and also

00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:44,600
here the subject line should be

00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:47,030
containing enough information like in

00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,700
the comet Soviet trying to tell you what

00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:52,130
path was changed so that you know you

00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:56,030
can watch this maybe I'm interested in a

00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:58,010
certain space in the code base so I can

00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,870
subscribe filter these messages say

00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:02,090
whenever something happens in this area

00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:04,670
I want to be informed so basically you

00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:07,400
generate the fire hose of events and at

00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:09,170
Twitter and then people can subscribe to

00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:12,830
what they want by filtering on subject

00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:14,600
lines on Sanders on whatever and this is

00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:16,830
what provides this real-time project

00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,289
status information this is a

00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:21,450
very impressive in our Apache projects

00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:23,909
because if you're in a sufficiently busy

00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:26,220
project there's always some times who

00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:28,529
someone who's working you know based on

00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:32,190
the time zones so you will commit code

00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:34,169
at 3m and 3.5 someone said oh are

00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,970
reviewed your code already this is very

00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:38,640
cool it's only because we have these

00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:41,850
events in near real time that this is

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,700
possible and I said this makes the

00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:46,350
status meetings mostly unneeded because

00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,610
the information is flowing you know

00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:52,950
what's going on you know what's the

00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:55,500
status you can query the the tracker the

00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:57,840
broadcast help requests already pretty

00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:01,200
much explain how that works so the idea

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,450
is that instead of asking Bob to fix the

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,820
memory problem you create an issue in

00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,740
the tracker even if you know that Bobby

00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:10,710
is going to do it maybe you assign it to

00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:12,059
Bob and Bob sees that and say don't have

00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:14,760
time right now or something more urgent

00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:16,440
the issue is already in the tracker he

00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,179
doesn't need to re explain it to someone

00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:21,360
else you can just point them it's

00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:24,299
shareable you know is about can you work

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:28,049
on CQ one two three four she says yes no

00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:30,179
worries so that's using the tracker for

00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:32,309
everything and it's not much work you

00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:39,750
can describe an issue in two lines yes

00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:42,029
Benson I'm activity trail yep we

00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:44,820
recently moved to get from subversion

00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:47,760
and it has an interesting effect on this

00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:49,559
yes because people tend to drift off

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,360
into their own branches for sort of

00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:53,190
unpredictable periods of time yep

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,350
they're there they're kind of late you

00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:58,320
know under the cone of silence have you

00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:59,549
you have any sort of advice about sort

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,649
of development rhythm

00:28:59,549 --> 00:29:07,590
so he'll remain just keep pushing your

00:29:01,649 --> 00:29:10,019
private branches or why yeah we used to

00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:12,840
say commits early commit often with get

00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:16,320
i would say merger early much often you

00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:18,350
know it's a gated i love doing branches

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,730
and get but they have to be very small

00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:23,789
you should do brunch for one issue

00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:25,139
issues should be small and atomic if not

00:29:23,789 --> 00:29:27,450
you should split them into smaller

00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:30,179
issues and then if someone doesn't merge

00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:33,179
within one day something is usually

00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:34,859
wrong or it's a special case sometimes

00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:36,570
okay you need to do big thing and you're

00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:38,730
going to merge and it's going to be a

00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:40,470
big mess you know get is much better

00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:43,109
than subversion in general for merging

00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:44,999
but still when you're a lot too much you

00:29:43,109 --> 00:29:48,859
bound to have conflicts so I think this

00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:52,169
often comes down to not breaking the

00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:54,289
problem into smaller small units small

00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:57,119
enough units and in most cases you can

00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:59,580
you know break down break it down you

00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:03,059
have one issue that says fix the memory

00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:05,249
problems okay what memory problems we

00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:07,859
have 50 of them okay create 50 issues

00:30:05,249 --> 00:30:10,559
and then you can do a branch and merge

00:30:07,859 --> 00:30:12,509
for every issue i think that's but i am

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:16,289
seeing this year and definitely seeing

00:30:12,509 --> 00:30:18,419
this with get especially you know we see

00:30:16,289 --> 00:30:19,950
also say that a system if you have three

00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:23,039
groups creating a system you will have

00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:24,899
three modules and i see that if we have

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:29,039
three groups working on a gift code base

00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:33,359
you tend to have three cycles of merging

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:36,239
people will then to go and that and you

00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:38,399
i tried to fight that say you know

00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:44,009
merger only merge offer nothing would be

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:46,350
the would be the answer for that so for

00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:50,130
the about the broadcasts requests and

00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:52,260
using abusing the tracker another

00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:53,910
nice thing with that is that Bob who's

00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:57,780
when he's working on that can make it

00:30:53,910 --> 00:31:00,000
his own schedule the way we you know I

00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:02,220
don't want a manager to tell me what I

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,290
should work on today sometimes this

00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,210
happens because shipping is tomorrow I

00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:08,220
need someone to work on this problem so

00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:11,310
bad phone can you please do it okay he

00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:14,280
says please so I'll do it but in general

00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:16,260
I want to come up in the morning and do

00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,240
a query in the tracker what are the

00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:20,730
issues that are potentially assignable

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,430
to me and what do I feel like working on

00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:25,200
today because you note in other ways in

00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:28,560
the same mood sometimes you know I'm

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:31,230
tired the kids have been partying all

00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:33,210
night and I don't feel like working

00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:35,460
complex stuff so I'll try to do some

00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:38,040
simple stuff that is progress another

00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:40,110
day I woke up early and I feel very well

00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:42,420
so I'll tackle early heavy memory

00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:45,030
problems if your co-workers can do their

00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:46,830
own schedule based on constraints of

00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:48,600
course maybe I have 10 issues with the

00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:51,390
same priority then I can choose whatever

00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:53,610
I want and work on one on one of them so

00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:55,830
that's also i think great benefit off of

00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:57,360
working like that and obviously the

00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:59,970
tracker contributes to the real-time

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,830
status updates then yeah the status

00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:06,570
updates are then mostly tracker queries

00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:10,410
and that's very very useful the

00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:12,360
self-service archives it's this is

00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:14,910
fairly easy because these tools to

00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,980
generate their own archives a good

00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:19,320
tracker will be queryable it will store

00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,630
everything that happened code reps which

00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,060
way does the same thing email you can

00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:27,030
create email archives fairly easily so

00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:29,220
it's so automatic what you need to do is

00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:31,860
to work with that in mind so make sure

00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:35,070
when you want you commit code to write a

00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:37,380
sensible comment so that it's useful you

00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:40,620
know what to search on it and and to to

00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:42,900
look at it later same thing for as I was

00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:45,030
saying is disclosing thing in email if

00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:47,010
you take time you careful about how you

00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:49,740
quote it will give more value to your

00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:50,130
archive if you include links and URLs in

00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,440
your

00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:54,750
sedges also bring small value to the

00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,210
whole thing so the self-service thing is

00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:59,250
mostly automatic because the tools do

00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:01,500
that but if you have it in the back of

00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:04,050
your mind it will help you create better

00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:06,660
archives over time we recently in our

00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:10,650
system we close an issue that had been

00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:12,690
open in 2001 this was this was great you

00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:15,750
know and you had the whole history why

00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:18,570
didn't they fix it in 2002 we didn't

00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:21,210
have time okay and then in 2004 someone

00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:23,370
said can we fix this I know it's too

00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:25,350
complicated maybe it will the standard

00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:27,240
with chain so maybe we don't need it and

00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:29,880
we had the whole history it was

00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,830
hilarious but we fixed it and we know

00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:34,890
you know who worked on it all the time

00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:36,990
and this is this very cool when you're

00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:38,430
working on long-lived systems if you're

00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:41,520
doing a throwaway thing you don't care

00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:43,200
but in our industry our customers tend

00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,510
to use our systems for five or ten years

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,790
so it's invaluable to be able to go back

00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:50,130
you know why why do we have this feature

00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:52,500
oh yeah I understand I didn't understand

00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:55,020
but now by looking at the tracker I find

00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,760
it it's also invaluable for new project

00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:58,830
members you know there's this theory

00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:01,170
that adding more people to a project

00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:03,090
doesn't improve productivity if you do

00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:05,490
this right it can actually improve

00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:08,070
productivity if people can have all the

00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:10,399
basic information in a self-service it

00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:14,639
will you know helping breaking these

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:18,710
communication bottlenecks so the

00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:23,010
benefits of this stuff the shared vision

00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:24,870
will help foster project success very

00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:28,080
often project failures happen because

00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:29,550
people they have different goals their

00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,919
work in the same project but they are

00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:33,960
not they don't really agree on what

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:37,050
they're doing so if you can create this

00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,909
shared vision by documenting by having

00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:41,370
the discussions in email which is

00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:44,639
archived it can be very helpful it's

00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:48,590
even with that it's hot but it can help

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,659
a lot the real-time status updates

00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:52,059
definitely

00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:54,339
help have less meetings meetings are

00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:57,609
incredibly expensive heard recently

00:34:54,339 --> 00:35:00,010
someone saying from now on I start eat

00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:02,650
every meeting by telling people how much

00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:05,410
this meeting is costing per hour you

00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:07,809
know you have 10 people here Oh senior

00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:10,240
project manager okay senior developer

00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:12,339
yeah okay this meeting is costing us two

00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,140
thousand dollars an hour you want to do

00:35:12,339 --> 00:35:15,760
it you want to waste time on that you

00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,680
want to you know extend it to one hour

00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,500
because it is scheduled for one hour

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,329
that's what outlook told you we would be

00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,339
finished about 40 minutes but it just

00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:27,460
drags because it's scheduled for an hour

00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:29,230
for an hour it's not good you know so if

00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:32,109
you can reduce the number of meeting the

00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:34,450
numbers of useless meetings then it's a

00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:36,430
great benefit and then it allows you to

00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:38,680
have enjoyable useful productive

00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:42,880
meetings which are worth two thousand

00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:45,160
dollars an hour the broadcasts help

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,579
request and the use and abuse of the

00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:50,530
tracker helped a lot in planning

00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:52,569
obviously by breaking down your stuff in

00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:56,020
smaller units it's much easier to

00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:58,690
relocate you know transfer issues to

00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:02,770
different people see see the evolution

00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:06,190
how many issues your your your resolving

00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:09,670
and so on so I think there's a takes

00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:11,890
time to to to do that right and Apache

00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:13,779
project successful Apache projects are

00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:15,339
often very good examples of that where

00:36:13,779 --> 00:36:18,069
you see that one issue is really about

00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:20,799
one thing and only one thing is precise

00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:24,010
it's linked to other issues you have

00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:26,559
umbrella issues that contain others and

00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:29,200
so on so this is extremely helpful for

00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:32,020
planning and for for you know knowing

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:35,829
where you stand that that's a great help

00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:37,660
and obviously the searchable archives

00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:41,760
and all these creates a knowledge base

00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:45,190
about your project and your product and

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,680
what we do in our group is that we say

00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:50,200
for example that an issue in the tracker

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,240
should contain the use case and as a

00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,210
small test procedure that allows you to

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,830
know develop to

00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:58,950
look at it understand how it works and

00:36:55,830 --> 00:37:00,690
then our ducks people take that do you

00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:03,150
often use that as a basics as the

00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:06,810
starting point for the documentation and

00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:10,530
so it's it's beneficial all the way so

00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:12,510
these are the key the main benefits i

00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:14,430
would say the project success of course

00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:16,140
having less meetings more efficient

00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:18,510
planning and creating a knowledge base

00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:20,640
as you go with little effort you know

00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:23,310
the tracker thing once you get used to

00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,170
it okay i fix the problem i'll write two

00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:27,330
lines maybe four lines in the tracker

00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:29,130
closed the issue that's none but there

00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:31,349
is some is history there is some

00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:34,880
information there's links to the code so

00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:40,589
it creates a rich web of information

00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:42,960
some side benefits of that you will end

00:37:40,589 --> 00:37:47,060
up with more sustainable software and

00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:50,550
processes by having this backbone of

00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:53,220
collaboration in your group it's easier

00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:55,710
to you know add change people expand the

00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:58,140
group shrink it whatever because the

00:37:55,710 --> 00:38:00,690
core information is independent of the

00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:02,700
people and you don't have these email

00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:04,830
inboxes knowledge bases that go away

00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:08,310
with the people you have it in a central

00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:11,490
reusable place further for the workers

00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:13,710
the colleagues it will improve your

00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:15,089
communication skills it's much harder to

00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:19,140
communicate on a mailing list and

00:38:15,089 --> 00:38:21,060
directly and you know sometimes you need

00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:23,160
to think a bit more but it's good it

00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:25,050
helps you be clearer and if you cannot

00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,599
express something in a few phrases on

00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:29,130
inner inner inner tracker it's probably

00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,160
not CLE on your mind so you need to go

00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:34,500
back and refine it you will also learn

00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,410
to make mistakes in public we will key

00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:41,420
to success in the in this in these

00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:43,950
schemes I've been active in Apache since

00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:45,570
2000 something you can find some

00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:51,060
interesting blunders of mine in these

00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:52,049
archives I'm not dead so I mean when you

00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:54,630
work in nope

00:38:52,049 --> 00:38:55,829
you will make mistakes in public and

00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:59,489
getting used to it is a good thing

00:38:55,829 --> 00:39:03,809
because you know it happens nobody's

00:38:59,489 --> 00:39:05,849
perfect and it will also help you expose

00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:08,209
where you can add value which is very

00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:11,519
useful you know whether in a soccer team

00:39:08,209 --> 00:39:13,289
if you're good to play on the right side

00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:15,359
and they put you on the left side it

00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:18,089
will usually not work so it's good to

00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:21,119
expose to others oh this guy is good as

00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:23,400
solving our memory problems then it can

00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:28,829
be helped it can help you know create

00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:31,410
the group effect being working in open

00:39:28,829 --> 00:39:34,769
way often also creates better software

00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:37,739
structures because you get the feedback

00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:39,269
from the others and they seed it and and

00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:41,969
because it's open there's more chance

00:39:39,269 --> 00:39:44,459
that someone will will will will see it

00:39:41,969 --> 00:39:46,019
it's the you know many eyeballs of open

00:39:44,459 --> 00:39:48,599
source if you can translate that in your

00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:50,519
own company that would be helpful and as

00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:53,999
a result will get higher software

00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:55,949
quality over time reputation and

00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:58,709
material trust that's also a big benefit

00:39:55,949 --> 00:40:00,989
for the for the colleagues know knowing

00:39:58,709 --> 00:40:03,479
who's good at what and and establish

00:40:00,989 --> 00:40:06,989
trust because you see people solving our

00:40:03,479 --> 00:40:08,969
problems so it helps you know bonded the

00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:13,739
group so in general you will get better

00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:17,219
quality and more fun I try to summarize

00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:19,170
this in five wisdoms so if you remember

00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:21,689
just one thing okay just five things

00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:23,429
from this talk it might be the most

00:40:21,689 --> 00:40:26,519
important thing and this is pretty much

00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:29,189
again how we work in Apache and all it

00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:32,279
all this is applicable inside a company

00:40:29,189 --> 00:40:34,199
a lot even a large one the first thing

00:40:32,279 --> 00:40:36,809
is if it didn't happen on the dev least

00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:39,479
it didn't happen so any decision any

00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:41,819
technical decision must be discussed

00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:44,130
documented on the dev list sometimes in

00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:47,099
Apache projects people ask but is it

00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:49,799
okay to have phone conferences and we

00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:51,929
say it's okay but bring anything

00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:53,699
important back to the dev list don't

00:40:51,929 --> 00:40:56,640
make any decisions in this group

00:40:53,699 --> 00:40:59,279
decision should happen in a place where

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,559
everybody can can have a look second

00:40:59,279 --> 00:41:02,749
wisdom is what

00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:04,759
working on it must be backed by an issue

00:41:02,749 --> 00:41:07,670
in the tracker it's a very good rule to

00:41:04,759 --> 00:41:09,559
make sure the tracker writes a story of

00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:13,069
the project and you can go back to this

00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:14,479
information third wisdom is if it's not

00:41:13,069 --> 00:41:16,189
in the source code control system

00:41:14,479 --> 00:41:18,579
doesn't exist I don't care you have

00:41:16,189 --> 00:41:20,630
source code on a file share somewhere

00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:22,189
hopefully this is going away today

00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:25,309
everybody is aware of source code

00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:28,309
control systems but it's been a struggle

00:41:25,309 --> 00:41:30,259
people said yeah but have a banner okay

00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:31,699
if you have a gigantic binary file maybe

00:41:30,259 --> 00:41:34,609
you need to have it in a different place

00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:37,249
with a permanent URL but it's it's a

00:41:34,609 --> 00:41:39,920
it's a special case whatever it's

00:41:37,249 --> 00:41:43,219
important needs a permanent URL you know

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:46,459
wiki pages email archives code comments

00:41:43,219 --> 00:41:48,949
whatever we so as I said we transition

00:41:46,459 --> 00:41:51,859
from bugzilla to JIRA in our group at

00:41:48,949 --> 00:41:54,199
Adobe last two years ago maybe and we

00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:56,269
created a redirection system so that the

00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:58,369
old bugzilla URLs are still valid

00:41:56,269 --> 00:42:01,519
because we have that you know you know

00:41:58,369 --> 00:42:03,859
issues in in in in wiki pages whatever

00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:06,289
so we wanted these two to stay stay

00:42:03,859 --> 00:42:10,219
valid so we created mapping which is

00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:13,519
very stupid the engines configuration

00:42:10,219 --> 00:42:14,839
file with 60,000 entries doesn't done we

00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:16,969
don't care you know it doesn't have to

00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:20,599
be very efficient but it's it's working

00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:22,459
so we kept the old URLs of the issues

00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:27,739
are still valid and will redirect you to

00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:29,449
the new issues in a new system and then

00:42:27,739 --> 00:42:31,160
you should be able to help to answer

00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:33,199
this question what happened when you

00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,640
were away you know this week I'm at the

00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:36,589
conference now I'm not paying attention

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,660
to what's happening in my group not

00:42:36,589 --> 00:42:40,519
close attention when i go back i can

00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:42,739
check the Activity Stream I can go to

00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:44,749
this in our case it's amazing list and I

00:42:42,739 --> 00:42:46,609
can skim the messages and see pretty

00:42:44,749 --> 00:42:50,299
much what happened while I was way so

00:42:46,609 --> 00:42:53,329
these five wisdoms will help you you

00:42:50,299 --> 00:42:55,369
know measure your process is it is it

00:42:53,329 --> 00:42:57,469
working is it working this open

00:42:55,369 --> 00:43:01,029
development way and once again very

00:42:57,469 --> 00:43:04,130
close to what we're doing in in Apache

00:43:01,029 --> 00:43:07,710
so that that's us that's how that's all

00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:09,450
the philosophy of my group

00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:12,780
work like an open source project as much

00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:15,420
as we can everybody has a voice you know

00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:17,460
the meritocracy aspect you can also have

00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:20,099
that in a company of course in the

00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,990
company you will have bosses which we

00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:24,180
don't have in Apache we don't have

00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:27,020
technical bosses in our projects in a

00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:30,599
company project you will have a boss but

00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:32,280
they should understand that you know as

00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:35,099
much as possibility use a meritocracy

00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:37,740
and then at some point business needs

00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:39,660
might get in a way say okay tomorrow is

00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:42,780
a release do whatever and then we do it

00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:44,820
then you switch modes for as a small

00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:47,670
time as possible then you go back to the

00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:50,280
more open way information is shared all

00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:52,349
the time this is very important and

00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:54,780
people learn from each other just by

00:43:52,349 --> 00:43:56,580
seeing what's going on and seeing who's

00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:59,010
good at what and seeing the work they do

00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:01,650
and the meetings are for vision software

00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:03,540
design the basic info flows all the time

00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:05,609
this is very important you know having

00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:07,650
this flow of all the boring basic

00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:12,630
information should be flowing shouldn't

00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:14,910
ask to should not have to ask for it so

00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:16,650
as a conclusion this works for the

00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:19,770
apache software foundation obviously

00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:22,530
this works for the DISA BB cq5 team

00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:24,450
where I'm where I'm involved if you want

00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:26,490
to do that I would suggest that you

00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:28,740
start with small steps you know try to

00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:31,849
break this apart see where where do we

00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:34,560
start what's missing in our project

00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:36,690
small yeah small steps that you can

00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,520
control if you try to introduce that as

00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:41,580
one big thing it will usually fail

00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:44,460
because people need to adjust and we

00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:47,369
sometimes we don't we don't like to big

00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:50,339
changes at a time also I've really

00:44:47,369 --> 00:44:52,440
missed at this this URL on my my

00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:55,380
delicious bookmarks that I'm that I'm

00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:58,589
you know expanding all the time on

00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:00,150
different articles on on that there's

00:44:58,589 --> 00:45:02,490
not many people from Switzerland here

00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:05,730
but we do remote work if you're really

00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:11,220
good so we are hiring in Basel if you're

00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:13,320
interested so I hope that the jetlag is

00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:16,359
not going in the way too much and I've

00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:19,359
been clearing my explanations so

00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:22,180
the basic ideas to yet take the good

00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:23,799
things of the Apache way apply this in

00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:27,130
your business there are some constraints

00:45:23,799 --> 00:45:29,589
but you can vary I mean largely apply

00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:31,539
this and it works very well for us so I

00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:34,569
hope you can try that if you're not

00:45:31,539 --> 00:45:53,759
practicing that already open for

00:45:34,569 --> 00:45:56,829
questions now if you have any yes yep

00:45:53,759 --> 00:45:58,089
would you stop this at that team level

00:45:56,829 --> 00:46:03,039
or if this is something you're

00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:05,559
advocating across these teams so we

00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:08,049
pretty much on our way to I would say to

00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:11,680
reproduce the Apache Federation model

00:46:08,049 --> 00:46:14,619
inside our or the part of Adobe that's

00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:17,829
working like that so we have we have

00:46:14,619 --> 00:46:21,099
different projects we have a witch of

00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:23,349
each have their own mailing list we

00:46:21,099 --> 00:46:25,900
starting to do also home pages like the

00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:28,180
Apache project home pages the git

00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:29,829
repositories and organizations so I

00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:33,579
think what what works best is the

00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:37,420
Federation Federation model a tendency I

00:46:33,579 --> 00:46:39,220
don't know in my company I think someone

00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,809
looks at one point of it as at the

00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:44,859
number of mailing lists and it's

00:46:40,809 --> 00:46:46,809
incredible we are pre I would say we

00:46:44,859 --> 00:46:49,450
might have as much mailing list as

00:46:46,809 --> 00:46:52,059
employees you know but some of them are

00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:54,190
history i can not used anymore we have

00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:57,099
been also pushing for busy mailing list

00:46:54,190 --> 00:47:00,640
there's a Stefano motoki and apache

00:46:57,099 --> 00:47:03,190
member he wrote this this thing about

00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,920
beard the busy mailing list pattern and

00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:08,349
you want that people are often reluctant

00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,779
I don't want to get 200 messages a day

00:47:08,349 --> 00:47:13,660
but we want to put it get people

00:47:10,779 --> 00:47:16,059
together so we we might have one mailing

00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:20,049
this per project but maybe we also have

00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:22,509
one you know cross-cutting mailing list

00:47:20,049 --> 00:47:24,320
and that's something that that's in my

00:47:22,509 --> 00:47:27,560
opinion that's a bit missing a patch

00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:29,840
we don't have cross-cutting technical

00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:33,050
mailing lists like you know if I've it

00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:35,930
something that's that's relevant to

00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:38,390
anybody working with Java in Apache I

00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:39,920
don't have a place to send that and we

00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:42,890
have that spawn with that we for example

00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,630
we have several osgi projects and we

00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:46,460
don't have an osgi at apache mailing

00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:48,560
this and we also don't want to too much

00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:51,260
my name is so don't have a solution for

00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:53,360
that maybe we maybe we need just a tech

00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:56,420
at Apache dota or guest and then we

00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:58,610
could tag the subjects with with

00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:15,890
whatever else relevant that might be

00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:18,110
interesting yeah well i would say what's

00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:20,630
missing what's often missing in a

00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:23,690
company setting is you know on the web

00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:26,090
you have google and you have blogs with

00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:28,640
RSS feeds and it's easier to find

00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:31,130
something that's where ever on the web

00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,900
in a company it's harder to have that

00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:35,000
because you have different systems and

00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,890
you don't have it often you don't have

00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,410
an indexing thing that says as good as

00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:42,260
google so that's a challenge so i would

00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:46,730
say the Federation model is probably

00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:49,750
what works best havin another question

00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:49,750
here yeah

00:48:55,170 --> 00:49:01,400
yep we're about to rule the business

00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,800
owners

00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:07,660
request the teacher and you might

00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:07,660
discuss like there to see

00:49:16,819 --> 00:49:22,199
so we're trying to get older the

00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,059
business folks to work in this way so

00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:25,559
like if they want a new feature they

00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:29,459
should write a use case somewhere on

00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:33,029
wiki or you know screw it it's somewhere

00:49:29,459 --> 00:49:36,660
and then quite often tech people need to

00:49:33,029 --> 00:49:39,059
to act as a proxy because you know they

00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:41,699
might not be using the tools as much as

00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:44,160
we do so they might not be used used to

00:49:41,699 --> 00:49:47,160
use them in a very efficient way so

00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:50,039
that's I would say that's what works

00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:52,529
often well to have one technical person

00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:55,170
with proxy so that this information can

00:49:52,529 --> 00:49:57,839
flow into this system without people may

00:49:55,170 --> 00:50:00,180
be having to do that directly but we we

00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:02,789
got goodbye info like our project

00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:10,549
managers or engineering managers to to

00:50:02,789 --> 00:50:10,549
to work in this system that's it yep

00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:16,940
right

00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:22,540
that part of the river

00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:25,540
right then we I would treat that as we

00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:28,960
do for example as I said in Apache if

00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:30,550
people have a nice IRC chat meeting we

00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,350
tell them please bring their the

00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:34,750
important information to the dev list

00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:36,580
then I we do the same so maybe we get

00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:38,320
one email from from the you know the

00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:40,240
business person saying we need to do

00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:42,430
this this this is this and someone from

00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:46,300
us will translate that into issues and

00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:47,710
wiki pages so yeah act as a proxy so

00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:58,540
that the information flows into the

00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:59,940
system yes fine I don't really know you

00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:02,500
know still like the lifeblood

00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:03,910
notifications for bugs you know

00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:08,230
committee asset is that sort of thing

00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:09,940
yep and aside from looking at some tool

00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:12,250
specific activity streams is there any

00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:14,340
better still like one funnel to

00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:16,870
integrate these different events into

00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:18,100
founder or should have asked

00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:22,150
you something other than mailing list

00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:24,040
right right so what I've seen what I've

00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:27,040
seen work well in projects is to have

00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:31,060
mainly listicle simply activity at you

00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:33,160
no activity at HTTP do whatever where

00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:35,170
you know it's so technical activity

00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:37,180
messages and then it's like Miss more

00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:40,150
like a message boss than at done an

00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:42,250
email is we are we haven't used any

00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:44,920
better tool so far RSS should should

00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:46,990
help for that but it is really nice is

00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,370
acting to leave this very quickly scan

00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:50,350
through that I know I don't need to deal

00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:51,760
with right one or two that I know how if

00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:54,190
you want to go back to spend more time

00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,140
on stay in mind you can keep it yeah you

00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:59,470
know it's part of my ordinary workflow

00:51:56,140 --> 00:52:00,960
right by being a separate tool or like a

00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:05,980
favorite

00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:07,480
yeah yeah it's a good school work for me

00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:10,210
yeah I think what's important is that

00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:12,640
the technical messages should not go to

00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:14,530
the to the discussion list they should

00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:16,390
go to list that's definitely technical

00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:20,020
because usually don't want them in your

00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:22,030
calves you know if you sir if I'm

00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:24,010
searching the email archive I want to

00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:26,770
search either on the in the human

00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:28,510
discussions or in the even stream so

00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:30,400
it's good to separate this at this

00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:32,410
lattice point but no I haven't seen any

00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:38,730
better to London email list so far

00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:41,140
that's funny but still what works yes

00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:43,360
basically have distribution list there

00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:45,760
you know sometimes mailing let's turn

00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:47,980
into chance definite have like somebody

00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:51,130
just asking babe Kaplan said you don't

00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:52,690
want in the archive so basically when

00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:54,400
when the discussion from the mailing

00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:57,150
that's actually produces something echo

00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:01,050
is that when you committed to the ARCA

00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:03,670
no way so the question is do we do we

00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:05,890
commit everything to the archive or not

00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:07,660
in our case we have everything in the

00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:09,700
archives so there's a lot of noise and

00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:11,800
that's that's a characteristic of

00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:14,140
Melanie's that's why I'm saying that

00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:17,140
that the guest of the discussion should

00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:19,420
go somewhere else and unusually that the

00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:20,950
result is creating an issue so you

00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:22,840
discuss you know how we're going to do

00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:25,300
this thing and if this discussion might

00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:27,430
be very messy and very noisy then at the

00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:29,800
end reach a conclusion I would transpose

00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:31,930
this conclusion into a gyro issue or a

00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:34,450
tracker issue and that that's where you

00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:36,610
get the more valid you know you know

00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:38,980
that that there's always a lot of noise

00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:41,530
in the in email and I don't think that's

00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:44,290
a variable it's more for us it's my

00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:46,900
email is more like informal discussion

00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:49,180
media okay in Apache you have the vote

00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:51,520
so we also do that in our groups we do

00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:54,220
we do the Apache like votes for stuff

00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:56,020
which are identified by both header in

00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:57,880
the subject line so you can use that to

00:53:56,020 --> 00:54:00,550
filter them so you know that these are

00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:02,920
more valid more structured than the

00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:04,960
fluffy discussions that happen all the

00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,970
time but that's what makes also the

00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,430
email search very inefficient because

00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:10,490
there's always tons of noise in this in

00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:13,670
this stuff

00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:15,680
it would be good if we could tag light

00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:17,180
like grind saying you know he's deleting

00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,369
the messages and keeping the ones that

00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:21,380
are important if we could tag email

00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:23,030
messages off after the fact that could

00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:25,460
be very useful you know go to the

00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:28,430
archive and say oh add the important

00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:29,960
valid annoys tag to a message that that

00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:45,920
could be could be a good improvement to

00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:55,980
the archives yes yep or ask you so the

00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:58,569
report install shoes but just know that

00:54:55,980 --> 00:55:01,960
breaking down larger aren't actual that

00:54:58,569 --> 00:55:10,779
changes where necessary they'll come to

00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:13,029
you in that style yep so yeah if you if

00:55:10,779 --> 00:55:16,150
you're making a big change into the into

00:55:13,029 --> 00:55:20,470
the system how can you break that into

00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:22,690
small issues that that's that's a hot

00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:24,279
subject and that that that's the same

00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:25,960
thing as Benson was saying about the

00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:29,589
merges you know how do you avoid big

00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:32,859
merges I think it's really important to

00:55:29,589 --> 00:55:35,049
try to maybe you have a first issue of

00:55:32,859 --> 00:55:36,460
first much that's a big thing because

00:55:35,049 --> 00:55:39,819
that's when you're doing the big change

00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:42,730
and try to try to minimize that you know

00:55:39,819 --> 00:55:44,440
differ as much as you can 22 after that

00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:46,660
so one thing once you do the Big Bang

00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:49,240
change then you can go back to that but

00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:50,970
you did yeah there's some points where

00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:53,980
you can't where you really have a

00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:56,440
massive change or or you decide that

00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:59,349
you're creating a new product that could

00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:01,779
be sometimes it can be can be a can be a

00:55:59,349 --> 00:56:03,609
way out to say okay this is so big a

00:56:01,779 --> 00:56:06,309
change that we consider this as a new

00:56:03,609 --> 00:56:08,619
product v2 of the thing and then then

00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:10,720
you start on you and that usually when

00:56:08,619 --> 00:56:12,970
you start a new product it's it's much

00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:15,279
more efficient if you can work like 3-4

00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:17,769
people co-located and then maybe you

00:56:15,279 --> 00:56:20,109
forget about our oldest temporarily say

00:56:17,769 --> 00:56:21,670
okay we're creating new things so nobody

00:56:20,109 --> 00:56:24,670
will know anything until we have the

00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:26,349
first the first version but I don't have

00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:28,779
a I don't have a good answer for all

00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:30,430
other than try to try to make that as

00:56:28,779 --> 00:56:32,890
smaller the change as small as possible

00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:35,980
and then go back to normal don't pace

00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:38,500
but yeah it's for much like creating a

00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:41,799
new thing where you need to work in the

00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:43,539
slightly more you know intimate way and

00:56:41,799 --> 00:56:50,670
then then you can you can go back to the

00:56:43,539 --> 00:56:50,670
more group way yeah yeah yeah

00:56:51,619 --> 00:56:56,250
yeah yeah so I think before doing it you

00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:57,810
should create clearly define what you're

00:56:56,250 --> 00:57:00,750
going to do and have use cases or

00:56:57,810 --> 00:57:03,150
description and the writing this down in

00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:04,830
wiki is a very good exercise you know it

00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:07,650
relates to what knowing was saying about

00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:09,660
documentation one wants you your ideas

00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:12,030
are clear enough that you can express it

00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:13,890
in document that's readable means okay

00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:15,480
you have made a good process if you know

00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:16,619
if you skip this step you might end up

00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:22,920
with something that's vaguely defined

00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:25,460
and vaguely implemented in here okay one

00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,460
more question

00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:57,550
but yes if I'm even if the the thing is

00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:59,560
if it's a small use case that you can

00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:01,540
express in five lines I would put the

00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:05,560
use case directly in the issue and then

00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:06,880
put also the test description also in

00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:09,730
the issue then the issue is standalone

00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,590
if it's more complicated than that then

00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:14,500
I might create a wiki page for the use

00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:23,890
case and link to that in the issue say

00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:26,290
increment this use case yeah yeah that

00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:28,600
yeah that's this that could could be the

00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:30,940
case yeah so that the wiki page

00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,710
describes a more a larger use case that

00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:36,520
you need several issues to implement

00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:38,170
yeah i agree with that okay so I'll be

00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:41,700
around if you have more questions and

00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:41,700
