Mahout in years past was known for being the place to go for premium OSS recommenders. Time passed and recommender technology moved on. With Mahout 0.13+ Mahout is once contains a state-of-the-art modern recommender targeting broad use. This talk covers the the 3rd generation Correlated Cross Occurrence Algorithm as it is implemented in Spark-based Mahout. CCO will be explained via the mathematics and theory behind it as well as optimizations made in Mahout to produce a production worthy implementation. We call CCO a 3rd generation algorithm since it comes after Cooccurrence and Matrix Factorization and is fully multimodal, making it possible to use many indicators of user behavior as well as contextual and content or metadata based indicators. While Mahout implements the core of the algorithm we will discuss how Mahout can be integrated into a full end-to-end data ingestion and serving architecture. We will also review some comparative performance data.

Pat has worked in startups building apps based on Machine Learning since 2000. He has worked in NLP/NER, text mining, and recommenders. He became a committer to Apache Mahout in 2012, and Apache PredictionIO in 2017. He is currently the Chief Consultant at the OSS and ML consultancy ActionML where he has led nesarly 100 deployments of their Harness ML Server which makes use of Apache Mahout and Apache Spark.
