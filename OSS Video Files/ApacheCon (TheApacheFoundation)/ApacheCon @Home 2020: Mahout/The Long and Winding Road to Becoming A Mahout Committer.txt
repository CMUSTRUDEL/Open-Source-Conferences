Description: 
	The Long and Winding Road to Becoming A Mahout Committer
Trevor Grant, Andrew Musselman, Pat Ferrel

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

Jk! We want you to be a committer. In this panel discussion various PMC members from (past and?) present will discuss how someone who knows very little or maybe nothing about Apache can go about getting involved with our community, what parts of the project we need help on, how we operate and more. If we can get some PMC members from Mahout of Yesteryear we will listen their stories of the Mahout of the Past. If we're really hurting for time, AKM will freeform about the joys of being a HAM Radio operator.

Trevor Grant:
Trevor is a former data scientist who has given it all up to pursue the app game, however will have probably given that up to pursue some other game by the time the conference rolls around.

Andrew Musselman:
Andrew Musselman runs business and data operations in North America for 24i, chairs the Apache Mahout Project, and hosts the Adversarial Learning podcast. He loves distributed matrix math and lives in Seattle with his wife and kids.

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,000
i guess we should be talking about

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,560
though removed whatever you want to call

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,560
it everyone

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:38,000
yeah right exactly it's so easy to do

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,960
uh native installs spark is super easy

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,480
that way

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,480
uh my experience anyway but

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:49,360
kubernetes yeah well everything was

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,399
well and that's it except not it's not

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,000
like as istio

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,160
and like all the all the cloud native

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,360
foundation like cloud native computing

00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,800
foundation so that was all both

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,520
kubernetes

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:07,280
yeah we're the new java

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,680
how's your taco fan good

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,280
i think we probably lost everybody but

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,479
uh not as bad as

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,720
you guys good lord you gotta be a data

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,960
scientist or something

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,960
what

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
who me oh wait i don't know what you're

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,080
talking about

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,040
oh that's very nice both of you guys had

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,400
a great talk i

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,759
i like the uh i i didn't know we had

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,400
so many r operators or matlab operators

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,200
had never even gone through a survey of

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,840
all that

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,479
yeah i don't use that much of it um i

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,880
use

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,320
right the part i use is pretty simple

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,840
yep

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,520
yeah everybody uses their tiny little

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,159
part that's that's the nice thing about

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,159
getting together

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,399
is somebody leading this or should we

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,280
just sit here and uh

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,399
talk about old times yeah we can do both

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,600
that was kind of a

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,840
point trevor's kind of the only new

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,200
new guy here and he's not even that new

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,640
years

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,840
oh but andrew and i go back to what

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,720
long 12 2012 or something yeah oh

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,720
09 release

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,640
right uh sunil yeah

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,239
and the oh nine release yeah that was

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,640
the first spark release

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,239
uh it's a neil's great folly as he likes

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,760
to tell the story

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,599
what have you ever heard himself oh i

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,080
gotta hear her story we all recorded

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,800
great polly i don't it's

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,599
it's it the punchline of it ends up

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,080
being why

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,440
all the major hadoop releases uh version

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,319
pin

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,519
like zero nine with like a couple bug

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,599
patches on it

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,720
but then never like upgraded updated

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,200
past that

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,360
he like did some dirty back then deal to

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,120
get him to like add the patches in

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,640
and then since they were all basically

00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,680
like trying to maintain parody with each

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,120
other

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,319
none of them ever went to 10 so they all

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,800
just left it at 09.01 or whatever

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,080
o3 or whatever it was at any rate he

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,200
makes himself sound like it's a lot more

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,680
important he's a lot more important than

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,200
he was

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,720
uh we are recording recording yeah

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:21,040
no he he's very important he was a major

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,720
uh player on that particular thing you

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,440
got to hear the story from him

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,280
yeah i think he is his role in that one

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,560
one part i think he self-aggrandizes a

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,360
bit we're recording so he's going to see

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,360
it anyway

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,519
this is me back that was a that was

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,560
really a pivotal part of the

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,120
project you missed that term but i mean

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,040
it was

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,440
all based on hadoop and mapreduce and

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,799
uh it became obvious that that was not

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,920
the future that

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,959
that produce was you know going to

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,840
sort of decay

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,959
uh if you will and i remember uh

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,680
sebastian

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,519
a skelter who was one of the prime

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,879
movers that back then

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,120
made an announcement on the after

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,720
we had all discussed it i guess i don't

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,080
know if i was a committer yet but

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,080
a contributor um

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,080
he made the announcement that no more

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,000
commits would be accepted

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:21,600
for mapreduce remember that andrew

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,120
fair enough yeah and i hope the 09 was

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,520
based on

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,280
on that yeah i was gonna i was gonna

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,880
reverse that actually

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,280
if anybody wants to come in and put bug

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,759
patches on old mapreduce code

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,560
cool well yeah that's i think that's

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,280
what

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,759
he he said was yeah if you want to do

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,120
bug

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,759
fixes or you know minor but no

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,720
new features would be yeah i think that

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,280
caught up with no new

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,280
algorithms

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,160
yeah but who needs algorithms if you got

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:56,080
math that's right

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,800
does any algorithm it's great

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,000
that's true you know and that's a part i

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,479
appreciated about

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,840
um i can't remember i just watched both

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,280
of your talks

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,400
but the point that that um

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:14,400
09 release was really the point at which

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:17,360
mahou became a a linear algebra

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,880
platform yeah first class linear algebra

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,840
and you know we were

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,800
i for one anyhow was looking for

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,800
something like

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,039
em live to eventually become

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,240
you know become that yeah evolve into

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,759
that because that's kind of my

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,639
outstarted with algorithms

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,440
and became a platform and spark stayed

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,080
with algorithms

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,400
and never really got to be a general

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,880
purpose platform

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:48,080
um and then andrew andy palumbo

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,360
came in about that time after after well

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,560
about nine was it

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,600
yeah yeah and he and dmitry

00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:00,160
did the whole samsara right and

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:03,199
dimitri um dimitri and sebastian

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,120
sort of started the spark

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,199
work and dimitri i think had most of the

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,639
operators and things working

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,280
by nine and uh and i just got polished

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,600
up

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:18,319
more with uh subsequent ones and i i'm

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,960
even impressed with how many how much of

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,319
that is

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,240
is in the code base it's great

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,600
anyway i'll stop talking because i my

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,319
battery's out i'm gonna go get

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,319
power cord are we are we in house chat

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,360
still or do we have uh

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,840
do we have people in here chris

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,280
chris is here and i don't know i think

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,639
we're creating artifacts for

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,560
later okay cool and and part of this

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,360
like i said having stories of like

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,039
mood of yesteryear uh was also part of

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,120
what i was hoping to get

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,720
on all this too i had to give an

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,479
abstract and i was kind of poking fun at

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,680
myself for some of my abstracts earlier

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,319
and my bios

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,280
i think like my kubeflow one was like a

00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,360
one-liner of

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,039
couples of exciting and fashionable new

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,560
work and we'll talk about how to use it

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,840
with mahou

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,840
trevor grant chris one day

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,880
and chris if you want to jump in i think

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,840
you're welcome you're welcome to join

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,880
we have some slides um and we can we can

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,880
go over those

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,720
i think um you know

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,160
it's kind of wordy as far as slides go

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,520
but if you wanted to

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,360
run through the slides we can do that

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,800
it's just sort of like a how-to how to

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,560
get involved whatever

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,960
right yeah i might too

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,080
in fact it's been a whole day i i was

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,840
gonna wait till the uh

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,199
whiskey tasting later but i'm gonna go

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:45,840
see what i got in the fridge okay

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:45,840
be right back

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,000
pat are you out in uh winthrop now where

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,440
are you at or no you said um

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,840
on the islands yeah cool i'm in

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,639
right there at the uh on the wood would

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,080
be side of the

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:03,199
ferry oh very nice okay

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,080
not today right you moved out of bay

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,199
bridge

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,319
we're in west seattle oh yeah that's

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,479
where we moved from

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:16,400
yeah oh really yeah there's no

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,840
uh bridge anymore right yeah my space

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,440
here i can see the bridge and there's

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,120
definitely no traffic on it so now we're

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,400
joking about how it's the accidental

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,800
island

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,840
exactly it always felt like an island

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,840
living there so that's right

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:39,279
are we started yet i think we're happy

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,640
yeah i could talk about you know i got

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,000
to be a committer

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,880
sounds good yeah that sounds good

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,880
um so

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:54,080
yeah i've done some uh

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,920
machine learning work in a couple

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,000
different startups

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,680
and got interested in what was happening

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,680
in the how

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,440
because of the scalability issue the

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,800
startups

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,200
at the time we're doing kind of web

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,640
scale things and

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,680
uh so this was 2010 or so

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,560
um meaning they had huge amounts of data

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,440
and the traditional ways of analyzing

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,000
that were just

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:25,440
at the time uh way underpowered

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,120
um you know databases and um

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,160
long sql scripts and things uh or

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,440
uh are in memory that was even

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,760
early for r but a lot of these tools

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,839
just

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,760
pooped out when you got a lot of data

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,040
and you couldn't do that in a production

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,440
way so

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,440
got really interested in mapreduce when

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,600
it started to come out

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:53,120
and uh one of the

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,360
i did a lot of stuff with um using

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,800
um how in text analysis in these

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,800
startups one was uh

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,640
analyzing um basically a social

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,120
bookmarking type

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,120
situation we're analyzing text in uh

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,560
pages and

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,560
it turned out we were kind of doing a

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,680
recommender content based recommender

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,399
and then we're using the hope for that

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,839
and then using things like clustering

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,120
and

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:27,200
similarity text similarity metrics um

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:30,720
and then got interested in um

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,640
recommenders i gave a little bit of this

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,920
in the talk um

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,320
did this was when i was using the hound

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,120
at a recommender as a service company

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,240
and

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,480
we ran into this limitation uh

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,079
where with a recommender you you

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,000
basically only use

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,079
conversions almost all the recommenders

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,440
out there even today

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,279
you only have conversions so if you

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,480
don't get any common sense if you don't

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,320
buy

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,000
you don't have any data for a person so

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,240
you can't do anything personalized but

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
we have all this other data like

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,320
pages they looked at and so forth anyway

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,320
um after talking with

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,240
people uh in the hound about how to

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,680
solve this with mahou

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:15,600
the answer was you can't and

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:19,519
ted had the kernel of the algorithm

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,240
to do this and um so i went and hacked a

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,360
version

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,880
of my out that would do this

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,839
just a hack and that got put into

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,640
as a contributor and i got put into

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,360
examples

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,560
as the solar recommender it was oh cool

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,399
yeah

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,399
it was kind of an early version of that

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,880
and then right about that time

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,000
is when we're this transition we were

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,440
talking about in the spark

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,640
and that i was keen on that

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,200
uh spark was you know clearly

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,800
the future of this kind of work at least

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,200
for a long time

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:59,920
and so i got involved in that and uh

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,320
sebastian actually hacked this the

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,079
algorithm together in a

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,680
i don't know must have been just a few

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:09,040
days it was a

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,560
basic scaffolding for the little bit of

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,240
math that we use

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,680
because he was there wasn't a lot of

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,760
documentation at that time

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,079
on uh all the things that you went

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,880
through andrew in your talk

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,720
so there wasn't uh that thistle wasn't

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,720
real well documented

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:29,519
it which it is now um anyway so

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,440
i took that and i was i became a

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,680
committer about that time

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,519
um and so implemented some of that and

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,320
some of the a few other tools around

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,160
that

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,079
but i think the the way that you get to

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,920
be a committer is you're interested in

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,079
in the things that you can do and you're

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,560
interested in using the project

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,120
if it's an existing project like that

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,040
and

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,600
you naturally sort of get drawn into the

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,560
place that you're most interested in

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,600
and that's about all it takes to show

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,519
that you're

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,839
you know committed if you're going to be

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,279
a committer and that you have some

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,519
uh expertise and even at that

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,279
you know dude i've been a manager for a

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,480
long time hadn't done any coding i

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,240
remember

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,160
um andy and dimitri uh critiquing my

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,399
comments and things and

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,440
you know and you know helping me get

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,279
better at that kind of

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,000
stuff so i definitely needed to be

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:25,200
mentored as far as a coder

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,240
so you know even though i'm an

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,480
old fart you still need to be

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,680
you know upgrade your talent your your

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,440
skills

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,240
and that's why joining a project like

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,279
that

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,920
like can be really a great thing for

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,040
even

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,680
you know younger programmers um

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,560
because you get mentored by some more

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:52,079
experienced people just naturally

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:55,279
and i think mahout is one of the uh

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,519
most congenial uh groups i've ever been

00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,399
involved with in open source

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,240
um that's really always here about me

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,240
yeah yeah

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,519
well both of you guys are great and you

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,199
know andy's great and

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,360
all the other contributors are great

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,680
yeah i mean um

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,959
everybody's pretty generous so anyway

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,880
that's my two cents worth

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:19,120
yeah if you're interested

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,320
yeah trevor you want to tell your story

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,000
oh okay

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,760
you cut me off but all right fair enough

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,120
what are you gonna say next oh i can go

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,160
you should do it

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:31,040
okay i can go uh i i

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,800
was uh similar to pat i was building a

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,160
recommender for a streaming music

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,680
company and

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,199
doing everything from scratch and doing

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,639
everything the wrong way and learning

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,800
along the way which i think everybody

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,639
does um

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,880
like even to the the depths of uh

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,000
starting in mathematica and at you know

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,399
building things and

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,600
doing a jdbc connection from mathematica

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,519
to teradata

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,279
and doing really silly things and

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,839
bringing teradata down with uh

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,600
cartesian joints and stuff like that you

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,160
know emails like can you please stop

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,040
doing that

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,680
um and i presented some some work that i

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,360
had done

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,320
uh to you know some kind of exec group

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,600
and

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,160
somebody said well have you heard of

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,240
mahu and i said no it happened

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,600
and so i got kind of got flat-footed

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,040
because it's one of those meetings where

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,480
somebody says well there's this vendor

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,000
or this tool that does what you're

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,000
talking about

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,760
whether it's true or not it was it was

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,800
interesting um

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,440
it was an interesting learning

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,160
experience for me to realize that you

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,800
know you can

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,240
you can look up all the all the things

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,240
you want but you might still miss

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,120
something that's already happening

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,680
um and i actually didn't use it until

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,959
later

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,440
at another position where i was

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,320
building something to do clustering of

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,000
uh

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,480
banking customers based on their

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,279
purchases and i used the k-means

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,639
uh job that was already in there and

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,920
maybe this was in the

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,800
09 build um and i

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,480
i you know got got all the data prepped

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,160
ran the job on it and then when i went

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,160
to look at the clusters i

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,839
i was mystified because i i was like

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,519
well

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:12,079
i see that users are clustered and i see

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,880
the actual user vectors in each cluster

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,320
group

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,320
but there's no user id

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,720
so so yes it did it did what it said

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,199
it was going to do and it clustered the

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,199
users but it had dropped all the user

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:32,000
ids on the floor

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,560
um and so of course i had chosen to do

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,959
it on a

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,800
uh you know tight deadline with a

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,279
customer who's already kind of pubed

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,440
about

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:44,000
progress and you know uh so but i i

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,480
one the person i was working with on the

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,240
team

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,839
said well why don't we forget this and

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,560
let's you know just do something else

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,880
but i said well

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,240
i mean geez there's an email address

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,000
where you can

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,720
ask for help and so i asked for help and

00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,079
i think it might have been

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:03,120
i might have been sunil uh

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:05,919
who said oh yeah that's a known bug and

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,839
so at the same time i was frustrated

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,600
because i had discovered a bug and a

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,319
release piece of software

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,679
and and and also found out that there

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,199
there were people who already tried to

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,240
figure out how to fix it

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,720
and i said well this is what i figured i

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,240
would do

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,559
to fix it and that was you know run a

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,559
really

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,799
on the results to match them up with the

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,559
original file and then

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,720
and i said that's what i was thinking

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,200
about doing it might have been sebastian

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,960
he said

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,200
um yeah you can do that and that's

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,760
that's what you know that that will work

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,039
but

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,880
why don't we try to fix it and so um

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,240
i got to work trying to fix it and get

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,360
some mentoring from the team

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:52,880
and was able to fix a bug so

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,400
um i think uh and then helping with a

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,240
release is a really good way to get

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,559
yourself involved so

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,000
at that time the release was uh still

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,679
pretty pretty hairy

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,360
um and they were you know like well you

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,480
said pat there was a lot of mentoring as

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,240
far as you know you didn't put any

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,679
license headers on your files you don't

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,520
know what you're doing about that

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,440
and you know it's it's actually a really

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,000
it's a wake-up call as far as well this

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,679
is

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,440
obviously how it has to happen i don't

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,919
know why i didn't think of that but

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,880
um it's actually it's a good growth

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,480
experience to get

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,559
you know informed no actually you need

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,840
to do that yeah that's kind of part of

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,919
the apache way

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:34,640
uh is

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,640
uh hygiene good code hygiene

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,799
um i kind of bristle at some of that

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,840
myself but

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,840
it's only because i'm lazy

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,000
that's a good uh example of how to get

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:53,280
involved

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,080
i mean on the other hand you know i

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,280
think a lot of

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,160
beginners are not you know i i know i

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,600
wouldn't have been

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,679
happy to get uh put on something like

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,600
the build test or something

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,120
to the exclusion i mean if you want to

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,640
do that kind of thing man do we ever

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,240
need that

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,240
but um i mean any kind of involvement

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,440
um that you're interested in and

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,919
motivated for

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,600
you'll get plenty of help like that at

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,960
the time we didn't have anybody helping

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,919
us with the build

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,480
oh my god and now we have a committer

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,280
who's an

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,640
expert and if nothing else we'll we'll

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,919
certainly help people

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,799
uh do the right thing yeah he's in the

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,440
chat

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,200
yeah chris yeah yeah he's done an

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,200
awesome job of

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,559
getting that wrangle together thank you

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,720
chris that's right

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,000
so we we actually so here's an

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,919
interesting point

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,360
we asked for help many different ways

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:51,679
because we were all stuck

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:54,640
on uh unwinding more than you

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,120
yeah i mean it's it was hard it's hard

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,120
because

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,480
we had a combination of ignorance and

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,200
lack of time

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,720
and we asked for help on the builds

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,320
alias and we asked for help

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,679
in uh infra and

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,760
you know we really were sort of out

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:13,039
there left left swinging in the way

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,919
and uh we had a board report where

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,840
we were questioned why it's taking us uh

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,360
you know a number of months to get a

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,280
release out and my response was

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,720
that's a good point uh here's what we've

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,400
done to get help and they

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,400
they actually reached out and asked

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,880
somebody to step in and help us out with

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,280
the build

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:35,120
so that's another place where

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,799
having a community around a software

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,280
project that says

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,919
well based on what we've seen over time

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,679
your

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,960
your project needs some help here's

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,799
here's and here's

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,720
someone to help you that was that's

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:49,360
something that you know we we could have

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,960
we could have really been on a dead end

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,760
if we didn't have uh

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,320
you know if we didn't have the uh that

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,280
support

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,240
so so thanks to chris thanks to justin i

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,320
think was

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:05,120
who uh who reached out so yeah

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,919
well justin did a lot of work on the uh

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,159
website too

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,919
didn't he a different dustin but yeah

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:14,640
i'm sorry other justin that's a she

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,640
sorry sorry justin if you're out there

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,799
uh yeah and um

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,320
so what else i think uh yeah chris

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,720
doesn't even know what mahout does he's

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,480
just

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:29,520
he came in and did a bunch of

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,080
file maneuvers but it was like the right

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,240
maneuver

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,440
so uh you know the build the build used

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,559
to be a lot of

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,159
really brittle uh commands that we

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,640
the release managers didn't know what

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,520
was happening and now all we have to do

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,320
is

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,520
uh release plug-in branch release

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,600
plug-in prepare

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,760
release plug-in uh perform and then

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,400
there's a lot of macgyvering over

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,919
ten years uh people like oh this will be

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,600
the one little thing we need to make it

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,520
work this much better and

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,360
a lot of that stuff is now since or had

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,840
since been you know

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,280
incorporated into apache build plug-ins

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,400
because it was the same problem everyone

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,159
had

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,440
but no one knew what was going on and so

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,200
we just kind of

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,880
a little more bailing wire over here

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,720
some bubble gum over there

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,480
and we'll survive we'll live to die on

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,080
another release

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,159
yeah cleaning all that out was really

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,280
really really clutch

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,039
we really appreciate it yeah this is the

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,520
longest point release i've ever seen so

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,039
anyway

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:30,080
yeah moving on

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:33,760
i gave it back plus one yeah

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:36,159
yeah have we have we announced it is

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:39,440
released yet i haven't done that yet i

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,120
i'll i'll be doing that later today

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,960
but i'm not sure the announce uh mailing

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,480
list will approve it because last time

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,200
they squawked about us not having the

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,640
right kinds of download links

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:53,039
wow i'm just saying

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,080
yeah are we gonna hear your story trevor

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,360
yeah so

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,280
apachecon 2016.

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,000
i guess before that i started getting

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:05,600
involved with the apache flink community

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,880
and um already he started uh

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,960
he started the meetups everywhere i

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,240
think but he started one in chicago and

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,799
he made me a co-chair of the meet up

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,240
and then we went out to um fling forward

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,919
in

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,919
berlin and that was really fun that was

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:23,280
i think my first big apache event

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:25,600
and i was trying to i i was doing the

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,840
i did a fling talk on zeppelin with

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,480
flake someone had done something but we

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,640
kind of did a drive-by and i updated it

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,960
gave a whole talk on this and that and

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,400
sunil was in there and i went out for

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,679
beers with him

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,960
afterwards and he was talking about how

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,440
you know

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,600
we really want to come up with some like

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,520
you know visualization where this

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,480
math stuff we don't know what visual

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,799
we're not sure how we're going to go

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,520
about visualizing things scotland java

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:55,520
that's not their sweet spot and i'm like

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,400
just use zeppelin and hand it over that

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,880
that z put stuff you were talking about

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,320
it

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,000
it's really really nice you can do that

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,320
now it used to be some really old

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,159
it was like just deep magic it was kind

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,919
of written to back up some stuff in the

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,600
spark interpreters and i'm like

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,039
nobody can't handle it from it's just a

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,200
block of memory

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,279
um there's no reason not to be able to

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,320
handle it hand it from

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,919
a spark mahout interpreter to a python

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,400
interpreter to an art interpreter and

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:26,640
just shuffling things around like that

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:29,360
um and then you made me committer i was

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,120
i remember working on like uh setting up

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,880
like apache servers in like

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,400
high school and thinking like oh man

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,080
these are so cool

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,320
all these apache people who do all this

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,039
stuff i'll never be cool like that

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,480
um so i had i had the entire like

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,640
conceptually

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,159
being a committer or even pmc was just

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,520
so high on a pedestal for me i

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,720
like never could be me um so that was

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,159
really really exciting and

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,159
now you know what it's really like

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,559
no it's always the same way explaining

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,159
to my to my wife like how

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,600
how exciting it is it's one of those

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,000
funny things like

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,919
no you don't understand i i just met you

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,279
know i just met a

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,360
you know a famous person or something

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,640
like that but yeah

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,480
but only in our own little nerdy

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:16,320
communities that's right

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,320
i know ted dunny yeah

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,159
sorry ted it's actually an honor to know

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:24,799
you i don't need to joke about it

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:29,840
i haven't seen him around this apache uh

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,840
magikon i wonder if he's here

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:40,240
but then yeah getting to see the same

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,240
people at uh the different um

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,880
at the apache cons that's another value

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,880
to this you know you kind of make

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,159
friends and then

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,559
having a project that's a part of a

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,159
larger umbrella project

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,760
and seeing the same people across

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,279
multiple

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,120
events and getting to know the same

00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,720
people and

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,200
being able to call on people from other

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,320
projects or you know it's

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,400
it's also very very nice yeah

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,600
yeah it's not it's you know a lot of

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,880
times you have a job and

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:14,159
it's very narrow you know you

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,640
you have to uh perform on deadlines and

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,200
you're

00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,880
working on fixing bugs or something and

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,679
this gives you a chance to do what you

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,720
like

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,240
i mean yeah pick a project that you're

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,919
interested in and

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,440
do what you like and you of course

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,559
you're working on your own time a lot of

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,000
times but

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:33,360
there are a lot of companies that will

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,360
sponsor you to some extent

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,440
right everyone mine does

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:45,279
a little bit i missed the one last

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:48,640
sentence it would respond to what

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:52,960
uh nothing just chit chat

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:55,200
say it that uh

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,480
companies will sponsor sometimes uh a

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,919
certain amount of your time being

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,600
devoted to working on

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:04,320
an apache project the other thing

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:07,120
the other thing is the um having that on

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:11,039
your resume is a pretty cool thing

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:14,640
because it's a known uh level of

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:18,240
uh standard of quality that is

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,480
above a lot of what companies do

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,159
so you know if you're uh committed to a

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,360
project it's uh

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,960
somewhat uh it's it's worth putting on

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,159
your cv

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,679
yeah that's yeah that's is that right

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,720
yeah they were if they were doing a big

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:37,919
open source bush and they couldn't

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,640
i did i say the company there was some

00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,720
three letter

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,080
some three letter name they they were

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,480
doing a big open source push and they

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,840
couldn't

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,880
uh bring their regular committers out on

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,559
sales calls so they

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,600
had a very clever idea just the higher

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,960
committers that they could bring on

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:55,200
sales calls

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,720
um that's that's not the only company

00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,799
who's done that

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:03,039
exactly like um and and you know they

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,000
i called them my patron uh they patroned

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,440
that whole

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,880
roadshow of 16.

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,640
we went to like 10 different cities

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,960
given uh the meetups

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,600
i was in seattle for a little while yeah

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,360
that was at that time

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,720
you were doing eigen faces or something

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,320
right yeah that was right that was the

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,399
eigenfaces one

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,679
got a lot of mileage out of that talk

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,360
that's when i learned that you don't

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,799
have to write a brand new talk for every

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,000
time you give it

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:32,000
that's right

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
yeah and we should put that oh in that

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,679
docker container too

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,080
because yeah yeah i think that was

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,120
straight uh that was straight zeppelin

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:44,399
that'd be a nice little notebook to

00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:46,240
throw in there too

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:49,039
but yeah having a company to patronize

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,080
uh your open source activities

00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:55,200
is definitely nice yeah i i uh

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,279
and i i started uh an effort

00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,799
at one job which was a huge consulting

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,880
company that um

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,880
you know they had some pockets of people

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,880
who had either released an open source

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,799
tool or something like that but

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:11,679
we started a program where we were

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,880
you know building small pods of people

00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,640
who were interested in

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,919
becoming involved in open source

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,399
projects

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,679
and then trying to make a a structure

00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,559
where they you know there could be like

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,360
a

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,080
coherent communication between that team

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,279
and

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,720
the project team um and it's

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,159
it actually helps with some of those

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,360
communications because what you can do

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,200
with that is

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,440
um you don't have to have all committers

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,520
working on something but you could say

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,600
like in the case where i had discovered

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,799
a bug on a customer project

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,919
i can say oh that's a bug i i don't have

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,080
time to fix this but

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,399
some somebody here does and they you

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,520
know as a committer to this project i

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,799
can say

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,080
here's how we're going to do it you're

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,679
going to spend some of your working time

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,559
on this here's how you write it here's

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,159
where to start

00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,240
and start mentoring that way inside the

00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,159
company that that's

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,840
um you know that's what people are

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,520
calling inner source i think a lot too

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,480
isabelle's doing a lot about that stuff

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,159
too

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,159
um but that's that's nice that's a good

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,559
that's a good point by the way the the

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,840
inner source movement and the

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:18,640
um and also working from home i mean all

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,120
apache projects work like that it's kind

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,640
of

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:26,240
uh moving to a remote work kind of

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,880
situation was so non

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,679
a non-issue for most of us that have you

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,880
know worked with

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:36,240
apache projects i mean things like this

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,279
are an mvd occurrence every friday for

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,919
my house right

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:42,640
yeah yeah every friday 10 o'clock

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,640
pacific time

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,520
and if you're central you can do it on

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:50,640
your lunch hour that's right

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,000
are we gonna give up before we end here

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,520
we're going to talk about what we need

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,840
most

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,880
i know i'm not running this agenda but

00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,559
if

00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,039
i were a committer or thinking about

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,039
committing

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,480
we can i'm going to expand a lot more on

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,000
the next one too

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:10,480
okay but but but yeah i mean like

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,919

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,840
need most

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,960
because i'm doing all talk on what i

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:22,159
think oh

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,760

00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,720
someone else to be uh

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,960
chair of this project that's very

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,559
exciting who would that be

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,000
it's me you guys are all pointing in

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,679
different directions i know

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,039
yeah i don't know where i am on your

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,440
screen

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,240
his initials are tg so it's not official

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,919
until the board

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,360
ratifies it but that's that's very

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,120
exciting news so

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,799
thank you trevor for agreeing to do that

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,559
and um

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,600
now we're gonna run things a little

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,080
differently thank you for doing it the

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,679
last

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,200
couple of years my pleasure

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,640
once they find that you've been doing

00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:01,679
some small talk programming you'd

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:04,880
probably be disqualified

00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:07,279
that's right so yeah uh

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,640
i mean what the the big bullet points

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:11,039
that we were thinking about

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,080
uh on the list were python bindings

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,880
that's something we've been talking

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,679
about forever

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,120
and we've sort of been waiting for a

00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,080
build process that doesn't

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,600
you know take everyone so long to to get

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,519
things going but that's that's that's a

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,720
big one for me

00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,559
say python bindings yeah yeah i agree

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,919
with that

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:35,200
i've heard that's another mess but oh

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:38,320
one thing that um uh i've always

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,120
i don't know griped about but haven't

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,279
had the time to put into it is

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,000
something like data frames it's the one

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:50,080
thing missing from our

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,519
bindings one of the problems that you

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:55,039
you were talking about

00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:57,279
andrew and your talk was remembering the

00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:59,120
row ids or something you know using user

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,120
ids

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,640
well there's there's nothing in there

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,440
for column ids

00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,039
and what happens when you do you know

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,240
math those things should just follow it

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,519
around for the most part

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:14,000
where possible um so

00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,039
i i thought about getting back in and

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,440
doing some of that but

00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,440
they're i don't know kubernetes

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:25,440
well i'll help you do the kubernetes if

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,720
you can uh

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,960
we should definitely talk about that

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,960
yeah

00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,519
so that's my one little thing

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,840
something like arrow maybe for trent for

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,840
taking data from one system to another

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,600
yes sorry something like

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,799
arrow for translating data from one

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,399
system to another

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:51,120
i think that's that's something that

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:54,080
would be interesting too

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,799
yeah that's been talked about uh several

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,080
times

00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,120
but now that was actually before arrow

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,440
so

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,519
yeah aren't we working on that to some

00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,760
extent

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,799
nobody's doing that right now just talk

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,800
it's all been

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,560
we got to push a new release out so we

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,240
finally got it out the door

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,599
and now we've got a wide open field to

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,960
actually start building features again

00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,159
which i think will be a really exciting

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,000
time but

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,359
that's why again can't thank you enough

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,520
chris for

00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:24,240
helping us get over that i hope that we

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,280
can never get over

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,280
because it's hard to keep people

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,960
motivated when you're

00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,399
just trying to slog through and get a

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,079
release pushed out

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,079
there's no new features there's no new

00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,119
cool stuff yeah it's been a bit of a

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,639
drag release

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,760
yeah and all of those changes that we

00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,159
went through

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,919
ended up creating a lot of technical

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,599
debt in the build and

00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:49,200
like chris kind of swept that away

00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,839
so yeah we should rename this talk to

00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,839
thank you chris

00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,040
well we i mean we have we have some

00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:59,119
slides here too

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,720
i think it's going to be fine for people

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,880
to read through but you know it's

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,599
like there's stuff that's like basically

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:10,079
a step by step how to be a committer

00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:13,839
so all that stuff's in the slides

00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:17,839
learning great criticism yeah

00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,839
these slides suck i know

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,200
and um you're saying you go to

00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,720
conferences and stuff

00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,000
and you're kind of we're kind of losing

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,440
some of that here but i think that's

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,440
like a really really important

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,720
and i don't know how apache way it is

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,720
but like

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,839
these projects especially when you get

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,079
away from like

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,119
the really really super big makeup

00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,880
projects

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,160
and even them to some degree too they're

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,520
like clubs

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,800
and so you want to

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,640
you want to be on a project with people

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,599
you'd be okay hanging out with because

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,119
that's kind of what this

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:53,680
is um and so

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,119
you go and you meet people and it's it's

00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,320
nice seeing someone in real life it's

00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,440
not the only way

00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,359
but i think it's a big um well even if

00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,480
you're you do the same thing in a slack

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,200
you know it's

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,119
it's quite congenial and um you know you

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,680
talk about other things than just

00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,640
just the project and it is kind of like

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,079
a clip

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,480
yeah but yeah it is nice to meet people

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,480
in person

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:21,599
maybe 2021 or two yeah

00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,280
someday the vaccine will come yeah

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,960
because i don't trust you guys

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:29,760
that's fair yeah okay

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,440
question again yeah any questions from

00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,160
anybody in the audience i know we had a

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:41,839
few people in there

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:41,839
yeah we had some good good attendance

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:48,640
oh it's like you asked for a volunteer

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,760
that's the response you get for a

00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:55,119
volunteer everybody steps back one

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,800
that's right well chris says like it's

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,480
on a big project all you have to do is

00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,960
become a committer and submit about 100

00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,960
pr's

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,480
not that many for us i mean christmas

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,760
submitted too

00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,960
but they were that's true and really

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,000
that's what it is you know

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,240
like 100 100

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,359
you know what a hundred documentation

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,119
typo fixes

00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:21,280
i would consider a committer on that but

00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,480
like sure one or two yeah like a big

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,680
either

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,520
a major bug fix or you know working with

00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,359
someone and becoming a committer or i

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,920
mean on a feature ad

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:33,200
those are um he says with maven even

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,280
more

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,640
um those those are totally valid um

00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,680
and so yeah and it goes back to what pat

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,560
was saying you gotta find something

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,000
you're just

00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,680
passionate about and you actually care

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,480
about um

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,119
or and i would say the other way is

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,440
something you

00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,800
are really an expert in you're like oh

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,720
here's a really easy way

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,200
which chris is like i know a lot about

00:37:52,720 --> 00:38:00,400
builds and just did the build

00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:03,359
or fast details fast utils was a

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,520
somebody who was an expert in in memory

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:09,359
you know hash maps and things and

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:12,640
came in and really sped up now

00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:14,400
so yeah that's um like and

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,680
and and chris jokes that he doesn't even

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,720
understand what mahmoud does

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,200
but he may commit her because

00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,480
he makes it worse that we need it yeah

00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,160
and that's okay and i think

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,760
i'm afraid that's what like scares a lot

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,160
of people off they're like i don't

00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,000
understand distributed linear algebra i

00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,720
couldn't be a committer for that

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,560
you can you can committer just help them

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,359
fix the docs

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,359
um that's

00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,640
yep chris says in uh plc for x they have

00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:46,320
committers with only one or two patches

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:49,040
i would agree that's blake that's

00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,240
more than one or two like document typo

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,400
fixes but

00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,160
yeah a couple a couple of jit patches

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,880
for sure i put them on the path

00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:59,200
committer

00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,800
or i would elect to add them so

00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,400
don't be afraid if you want to be a

00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,880
community come on down it's an easy

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,800
it's an easy fix it's it's uh it makes

00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,040
it easier for you to get to contribute

00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,640
and uh you know it's not a big

00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,720
commitment either it's just uh

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,760
if if you wanted if you want to do the

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,000
work you can

00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,880
you can do it you can do it easier and

00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,760
sort of have a

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,760
have a merit badge

00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,480
yup

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,560
cool well i think that's about time for

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,680
us

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:34,640
so um if you all want

00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,079
i guess come and see the next talk i'm

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,160
gonna take a quick little break before i

00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:41,760
jump over so you've got a couple minutes

00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,760
um i'll probably start at maybe

00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:49,359
we've got a 35 on my time zone so

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,560
i'll probably start okay and i have 20

00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:52,160
minutes before i have to do another

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,520
meeting but i will be over there

00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,839
