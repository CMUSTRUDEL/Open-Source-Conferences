Trevor Grant, Andrew Musselman, Pat Ferrel

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

Jk! We want you to be a committer. In this panel discussion various PMC members from (past and?) present will discuss how someone who knows very little or maybe nothing about Apache can go about getting involved with our community, what parts of the project we need help on, how we operate and more. If we can get some PMC members from Mahout of Yesteryear we will listen their stories of the Mahout of the Past. If we're really hurting for time, AKM will freeform about the joys of being a HAM Radio operator.

Trevor Grant:
Trevor is a former data scientist who has given it all up to pursue the app game, however will have probably given that up to pursue some other game by the time the conference rolls around.

Andrew Musselman:
Andrew Musselman runs business and data operations in North America for 24i, chairs the Apache Mahout Project, and hosts the Adversarial Learning podcast. He loves distributed matrix math and lives in Seattle with his wife and kids.
