00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,679
thank you everyone for

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,599
coming to mahut khan the track of apache

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,000
con at home

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,520
it's been a a lot of fun putting this on

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,239
i really appreciate everyone who's given

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,719
the talks

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,440
um learned a lot a lot a lot of cool

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,120
stuff

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,360
saw us from stuff from some new

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,440
presenters that i hope we will be able

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,800
to get integrated in soon

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,399
um but in this talk which i'm probably

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,559
going to run short and

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,239
that's fine i want to talk about you

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,160
know the state of the project

00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,640
um andrew said on the last talk

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,320
uh that i we're waiting for official

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,519
board confirmation but

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,799
i'm gonna be the um next chair

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,080
so i guess it's i want to talk about you

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,479
know where we've come from where we've

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,520
been for the last year or two and

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,840
what i'm hoping to work on um and that

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,520
we as a community also work on

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,240
over the next uh 12 to 24 months

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,119
that said it's a community i can provide

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,240
direction but

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,240
if somebody comes through and wants to

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,119
work on some other cool stuff that's

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,000
cool

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,880
um i was joking on an internal slack

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,079
channel

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,159
but i have no intention of bucking the

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,600
apache way and becoming

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,720
well i was going to say i'm a level in

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,560
dictator but a dictator of any sort um

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,159
so yeah that said let's get started

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,520
oh i already said you know where have we

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,720
been where are we going and that's

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,439
really what this is all about

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,119
um so i guess let's look at where we've

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,360
been um

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,479
over the last 24 months there was a

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,880
build leaf

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,439
basically a big refactoring and then

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,840
having a really hard time

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,239
releasing the next point release we we

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,840
did a release 14.

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,120
we didn't have binaries because

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,040
something got messed up when we did the

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,640
well we first we did the big refactor

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,760
we did a big refactor um that finally

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,879
you know moved the old mapreduce code

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:26,080
into its own thing and

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:29,280
it was it was deprecated since i think

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,400
10 before my time um so six years ago

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,519
and we said okay this has been

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,360
deprecated

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,040
we're not going to break anything it's

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,840
still there

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,560
but we're demoting it from first class

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,480
citizen

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,080
it it exists but as far as i know

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,920
nobody active on the project knows how

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,519
that works that is the old magic

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,040
and so bart a big part of that refactor

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,519
was like let's put the

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,480
let's let's label the old magic as such

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,280
these are things that

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,720
is are not being maintained we don't

00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,440
even really know how they work

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:04,959
so use at your own risk um

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,519
doing that the build was macgyvered

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,680
together

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,680
over 12 years uh by

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,280
as i think i've seen some some of the

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,560
older pmc say

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,720
mathematicians that were just kind of

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,480
good at hacking things um

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,400
a lot of those hacks have now been

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,120
formalized into proper

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,840
build plug-ins and we were just overdue

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,120
for a build

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,879
uh rehab a rehab of our palms and

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,480
chris dutt's did an amazing job doing

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,480
that in the last uh

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,720
few weeks uh well maybe a couple months

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,680
i forget how long ago was he came on

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,360
um but yeah it helped us out a ton with

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,560
all of that

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,879
and we were finally i think

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,680
within the last 48 hours we have all our

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,599
votes

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,760
we're now gonna have 14 one hopefully

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,680
really like announced and really soon

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,799
um which has its binaries everything's

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,599
working right

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,280
um everything's up to snuff and that's

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,080
really great because

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,760
it's hard to maintain momentum and

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,239
keeping people interested

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,879
when you're just slogging a never-ending

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,680
battle

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,319
trying to get a passing build that's not

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,040
fun new

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,640
fun new features and things like that

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,680
are like what keep the people interested

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,920
and excited

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,280
a lot about opens just building you know

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,759
software for free

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,320
and when you're constantly fighting this

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,800
chore

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,240
of trying to get a release out it it

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,360
takes a lot of the wind out of the sale

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,759
so

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,560
we're again super super grateful uh to

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,040
chris for that

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,759
and that brings us into you know okay

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,000
cool

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,800
so what um are we gonna be doing for the

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,440
next like what's next

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,560
so the builds are in much better shape

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,080
um

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,560
but you might have noticed jenkins went

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,120
down uh we're moving into get actions

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,919
there are issues with that there right

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,080
now if you make

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,759
updates to the website those do not

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,120
build um

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,199
we need to get in for involved we need

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,240
to get some tokens um we just need to

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,919
get all that worked out

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,160
we've got continuous work continuously

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,039
we're still migrating from jenkins to

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,280
get actions

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,960
um it will work but we've been kind of

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,800
mainly focused on

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,080
the build so a lot of this stuff is just

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,720
taken second place

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,400
taking backseat to the more pressing

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,160
issue of again getting

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,520
the uh build working but now that that's

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,600
done

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,880
finishing that migration and making it

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,000
and getting it looking right

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,759
is a high priority the next

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,600
thing um that we need to do once we have

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,320
a website up is we found a lot of

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,160
issues with the docs um things that talk

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,720
about how

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,080
the relics of docs from like version 010

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,880
that apparently no one's looked at are

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,759
updated

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,720
we updated the website and we just sort

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,880
of did a mass

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,360
copy paste job um updating to the new

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,120
website and we need to go through and

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,280
update a lot of things we need to

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,960
there's there's old broken math jacks

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,560
there's we were talking about like

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,080
opportunities for committers

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,680
if you're good with get actions great

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,000
opportunity if

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,360
you can just find you know like oh hey

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,319
there's broke math jax

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,360
here's the fix cool that's like a very

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,440
very useful thing

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,639
updating the wikipedia also something

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,919
that looks like it was last done

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,680
probably around 0 10. um

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,560
someone just needs to get in and do that

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,080
um and there's a lot of other

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,479
spaces in the world that keep referring

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,800
to as you know mapreduce because

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,000
no one's been there to update it since

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,759
that was true

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,240
um and finding those things and doing it

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,720
that's another uh great opportunity

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,120
um but we can't wait for people to come

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,039
on to do that we also need to like

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,400
just be taking a little more active role

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,919
ourselves and so that's a secondary

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,199
priority i would say but it's still

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,960
definitely a priority

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,960
is updating how we face the world with

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,319
that

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,680
the third um new feature and andrew

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,759
was talking about this on the last one

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,560
and something i've been thinking for a

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,000
while you know

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,919
python is the is turning into the de

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,039
facto standard for

00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:02,080
data science and having python bindings

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:05,199
are go would be a a serious

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,000
um step forward for my hoot um

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,560
and i've talked to holden who did a lot

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,520
of the python bindings for pi spark

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,560
and i think she can help um and i'll i'm

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,080
probably gonna take

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,360
lead on that again getting the ci up and

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,360
websites is

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,880
highest priority and then you know

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,400
starting work on the docs on wikipedia

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,479
but this is going to be

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,840
um i'm hoping in the next couple months

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,319
that i'll personally start working on

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,840
this

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,080
and anybody who's interested in learning

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,160
about how jabba python bindings work

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:39,440
i've heard that it's a um unpleasant

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,440
thing to do um but i think is a

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,880
necessary next step and i'm

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,879
looking forward to getting cracking on

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,319
that and figuring it out because

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,840
unpleasant though it may be i think it

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,759
will be a huge huge boost for the

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,800
project

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,680
this docker container i built basically

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,039
a couple weeks ago i want to formalize

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,759
that out

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,199
apache has proper docker container

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,120
releasing

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,879
stuff i'm going to get within for next

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,000
week i want to figure out what it's

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,919
going to take to

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,520
okay let's build this docker container

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,720
let's push it to

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,039
um the apache docker repo so

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,039
that getting started with the hoot is as

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,639
simple as a docker pull

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,720
and then a docker run with a port

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,520
forwarding and you fire up a docker

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,759
container

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,639
we have some custom notebooks in there

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,400
that um

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,000
everything works we're then we're not

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,720
then tied to

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,320
zeppelin's release cycle and how they

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,599
update spark and then we have to update

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,200
spark to keep up

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,640
we have a docker container we have a

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,560
container that we own

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,159
and even if zeppelin updates three times

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,360
and we only update once

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,599
we know that the getting started

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,320
container works um this would be

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,720
a divergence from the way it currently

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,000
works where there's a build script and

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,440
some other janky background stuff that

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,959
doesn't necessarily work and i'm not

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,480
even sure what the status on it is

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,240
but yeah having a docker container that

00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,880
you can pull and you can start using

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,360
mahoot

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,600
um i think would be a great next step

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,320
and has the examples of

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,680
doing some uh work and then being able

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,000
to pass that over

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,959
to use like r or python to like

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,560
visualize it

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,760
and then even better if we were able to

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,880
get you know we'll probably do some

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,760
sneak peeks

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,640
as we get python bindings like you can

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,320
this is you know

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,480
definitely beta but if you want to play

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,240
with the python bindings

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,440
here's a here's some cells that show how

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,399
that works and let us know what you

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,040
think

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,480
uh data reusability work arrow etc again

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,480
things we've been talking about for a

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,480
long time

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,519
if you know arrow and you're interested

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,080
in this stuff

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,160
cool jump on the mailing list um let's

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,120
start talking about that because

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,640
we have a release product now we've got

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,440
we've we've gotten over that major hump

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,800
that's

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,320
jammed us up for the last again 12 18

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,720
20 24 months we've just been stuck

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,680
so now's the time we can finally start

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,040
you know whatever

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,880
is something cool that you want to work

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,920
on great

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,600
we can start doing that now um and

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,920
and i'm excited i think this is gonna be

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,640
awesome i'm excited to start

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,040
writing features again instead of

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,560
logging in and be like ah

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,920
all right let's spend another few hours

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,200
hacking at this build and maybe we'll

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,200
get something working

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,800
um that's again it's just it was

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,200
it takes the wind out of your sails but

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,560
this you know doing cool stuff like this

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,640
i i don't know about you but it gets me

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,360
motivated and um

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,839
i'm excited for it so with that i'm

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,120
going to go

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,680
to the whatever for questions that's not

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,040
the right

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,760
thing um

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,959
thank you thank you again uh muscleman

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,399
um

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:48,560
for nominating me okay my thing's off

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,880
all right cool so i've seen a bunch of

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,399
people um and i'm sure i didn't answer

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,399
everything and i'm sure i'd cause more

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,839
questions than i even might have

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,640
answered so

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,000
open floor thoughts uh feedback other

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,040
questions things you're interested

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,680
in seeing uh feel free to type in

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,440
a little uh chat thing make sure you're

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,040
on session not event

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:14,560
or check i'll i've also been watching um

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,720
the apache con mahu channel so whatever

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,680
you want but i would love to get some

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,200
feedback

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,720
because if no one gives me feedback i

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,160
assume no one cares

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:29,839
and i hope that's not true since there's

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:29,839
eight of you in here

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,560
okay well i guess no one cares it hurts

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,839
my feelings

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,920
all right

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,279
i agreed uh muscleman says he'd love to

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,480
hear viewers from what their interests

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,720
are and i would too

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,720
i

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:59,839
um yeah please do you know these

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,399
projects are communities so like even if

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,160
it's like the

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,560
the first time the sec first or second

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,800
time you've heard of but

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,800
you said hey from what i get it doesn't

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,519
do this or i'd love to learn more about

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,680
that but i couldn't

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,760
find anything or yeah

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:25,839
open floor there are no wrong answers

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:25,839
what do we got

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:53,040
okay oh cool got two

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,720
i'm gonna go lauren uh lockridge's came

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,000
up first so i'll ask answer hers

00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,000
first vision for future in terms of

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,279
scientific advances

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,320
um so i don't know if you saw earlier we

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,200
uh

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,399
recently uh published a paper um

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,600
actually there was two papers that

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,560
dropped on mahou

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,959
this year um there's sebastian's that

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,440
was explicitly on mahoot and then

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,240
i wrote one on denoising ct scans but i

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,320
think that's great

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,839
like right like incorporating mahout

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,320
into scientific papers i think is a

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,440
great

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,279
um it's called marketing for lack of a

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,000
better reason because

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,120
uses matrix algebra it's a better fit

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
than

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,959
more black box uh machine learning

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,079
methods

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:41,760
uh in my opinion um

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:44,639
but in terms of like

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,000
who's gonna write it's um whoever is

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,399
going to do the work gets to make the

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,240
call on what the scientific advances are

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,440
um we saw one of the first talks that

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,000
was in spanish

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,360
he devised ridge regression in mahou

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,120
we're going to get that rolled in

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,040
so part of it too is not only

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,800
encouraging people to do these things

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,600
but then also being aware of what was

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,000
done and then helping them commit

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,440
those algorithms back to the um the

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,959
trunk

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,639
um see

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,480
a good source to learn about machine

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,160
learning for programmers

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:21,360
um i'll obviously pitch uh palumbo

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:24,480
and uh dimitri's book um if

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,600
someone can drop a link to that from uh

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,760
amazon

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,720
and then i will also of course pitch my

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,920
book

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,440
however i wouldn't say at least might

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,360
i don't know that either necessarily

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,920
great machine learning um

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,720
palumbo and dimitri's book it has a lot

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,480
of good like

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:45,040
distributed math um mine is about

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,399
productionalizing machine learning

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,920
models

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,639
learning about machine learning for

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,639
programmers

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,480
it depends what language you're going to

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,440
be in um and exactly what you mean about

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,040
what you want to learn

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,639
uh if you're trying to learn like for

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,920
python

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:04,720
it's one thing scotland spark isn't

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,399
docs maybe um or do you want to learn

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,079
how to implement the algorithm or use

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,680
the algorithm in a particular language

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,680
do you understand

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,399
why does random forest work and why is

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,839
can it be better than

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,360
what are the pros and cons of random

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,360
forest versus like um

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:27,839
vector machines i forget

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,839
what another algorithm um

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,120
so it's a loaded question

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:38,240
um but actually scikit-learn

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,680
reading scikit-learn docs um are a great

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,360
overview of a lot of common algorithms

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,079
that you can you can pick up pretty

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,600
quick because they do a pretty good high

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,440
level like hey here's the

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,800
gist of what's going on in this

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,839
algorithm and here's why i would use it

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,440
against this other one

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,880
so yeah scikit-learn docs are a great

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,320
place to learn about machine learning in

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,639
general for programmers

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,399
even if you end up using things besides

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,959
scikit-learn

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,320
um multi-core yep we do have a lot of

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,839
multi-core oh yeah the multi-core and

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,839
gpu stuff that's also

00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,839
um

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,639
alexander uh that's fine do you

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,040
have any people focusing specifically on

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,240
onboarding new users

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:25,360
yes and no we all to sort of try

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,000
but we don't have nobody's getting

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,000
paid so we don't have anybody

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,360
specifically dedicated to it

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,720
we all i think and feel free to

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,160
contradict me if uh

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,320
you disagree have sort of

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,680
not fifed hims but something like that

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,199
parts of the project that we understand

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,800
more than other people

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,279
and so someone comes in and they're

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,399
interested in a specific part

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,160
then that person will help onboard them

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,519
because they understand it the best

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,160
for example if you're interested in

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,720
multi-core cpu and gpu execution

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,000
um andrew palumbo was like really really

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,920
really in-depth on that

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,680
and he can speak to that a lot more than

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,240
i can um

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,839
i'm generally kind of keep up with

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,400
what's going on there but

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,360
i couldn't uh i i'd be in the same

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,679
position as you

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,880
and probably further behind if i started

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,640
trying to do that

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:22,799
um so

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,520
yeah um but we all try to do evangelism

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,240
i mean

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,919
this entire mahukan was an evangelizing

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,799
event this is here to get other people

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,320
interested

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,840
in mahou so hopefully they go out and

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,840
try it um

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:42,320
and then okay so i'm back to nicholas

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,520
uh hadn't had attendance

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,679
okay i want to understand how apply

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,039
algorithms to a given problem domain

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,120
it seems incredibly abstract

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:54,080
the problem domain or machine learning

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,080
seems abstract

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,840
nicholas

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,320
but i guess in general um if you're

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,200
doing machine learning your

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,280
first or anything like this your first

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,960
question is going to be are you trying

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,960
are you trying to categorize something

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:27,120
or are you trying to guess a number

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:30,080
um and from there

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,880
it kind of depends on how much the math

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,280
you have

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:38,160
and it's

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,600
i would say that the approach differs

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,880
it's it's going to be a different route

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,799
for everyone and it's going to be a

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,600
function of how much math you have

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,240
uh how much bath background you have um

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,400
there's

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,280
simple ways and a simple way might be

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,440
better than

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,720
nothing and a lot of times a simple name

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,919
might a simple way that you can

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,480
productionalize

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,840
might be better than a complex way

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,679
that's much much more accurate

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:05,440
um without

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:08,160
knowing what

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,880
problem domain you have it's kind of

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,120
hard to

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:16,160
know but i would say

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,960
find someone and you you can see on the

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,400
last talk

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,000
pat was talking about okay

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,679
weather data on energy consumption

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,600
perfect all right that i can

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,440
that's concrete enough i can give it i

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,840
can pontificate on

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,520
um you're probably going to want to like

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,720
let's let me say in a very

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,760
simple model you want to see does energy

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,960
consumption go

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,880
up or down with weather

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,480
or given a set of weather how much

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,720
energy consumption do you predict

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,600
in kilowatt hours cool regression

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,320
problem

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,679
i you could start and in fact you

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,120
arguably should start

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,039
simple regression um then you can get

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,000
into you can read and find other

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,799
algorithms and you can find more

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,720
specific

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:06,640
um algorithms that would be applicable

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:10,080
um there's a like um first order arima

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,919
that basically just means that like

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,360
you look at what like one of your inputs

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,960
is what was just happening

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:20,400
um there's but there's like an

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:23,600
um is wide of a field as

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,120
programming is math is i would say just

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,520
as wide if not wider

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,000
so i can't tell you exactly but like you

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,880
want to start with a simple simple model

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,480
and then a b test and tried more

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,039
complicated models

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,400
and make that decision is this more more

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,600
complicated model

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:44,000
giving me enough

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,760
a high enough increase in accuracy that

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,520
it justifies the additional complexity

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,120
of the model that i've introduced

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,600
that's my personal one-liner on

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,840
how to get started and so don't feel

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,960
overwhelmed by the math

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,039
because and and a lot of seasoned data

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,200
scientists will make this mistake too

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,360
they will try to go for like oh let's

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,440
use deep learning what could go wrong

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,720
but that's bad that's a bad first step

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,320
that's a bad first step

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,720
a simple simple model that maybe isn't

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,840
perfect but is easy to productionalize

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,640
and easy to understand where it's going

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,159
to go wrong

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,880
i think significantly out way is more

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,720
valuable

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,159
than a complicated black box model

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,000
that's very accurate

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,919
that's my two cents and you'll find

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,200
plenty of people to disagree with me

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:34,320
um but again just my

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,840
yeah so

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:44,240
um other other questions

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:48,080
i do appreciate everyone who has so far

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:50,720
is everyone uh is everyone on the

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,720
mailing list

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,840
is anyone on the mailing list

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,880
has anyone joined the mailing list

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,000
because of uh or planning on joining the

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,320
mailing list because of

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,320
god

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:19,760
well i hope

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,600
everyone does join um we again i think

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,600
bringing up that uh docker container

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,039
soon will definitely ease the onboarding

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,559
process for everyone

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:31,679
which nice

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,679
i appreciate it chris

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,280
um i think the docker i'm hoping the

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,039
docker and zeppelin will make this a lot

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,919
easier for people to

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,360
dip their toes in the mahoot waters um i

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,280
definitely appreciate everyone coming to

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,960
all of our events

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,400
please do join the mailing list to keep

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,440
this conversation going

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,080
we also have a chat slack channel

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,440
on um the apache mahou or i'm sorry on

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,000
the apache

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,760
slack the apache slack i forget what you

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,320
call it we have a channel

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,760
on the asf slack i think that's the

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,919
right way if that's the right verbiage

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,880
so feel free to reach out to us on there

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,799
um if you're

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,159
using the hoot and you're having any

00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:11,520
problems we're all

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:14,000
um more than happy to help just set like

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,080
andrew said we're all volunteers so if

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,520
we don't answer right away

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,840
we might just be working on regular day

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,799
jobs and we don't we will get to

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,760
when we got a minute so thank you again

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,880
um

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:37,840
and i guess until next year

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:37,840
happy mooding everyone bye

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,279
