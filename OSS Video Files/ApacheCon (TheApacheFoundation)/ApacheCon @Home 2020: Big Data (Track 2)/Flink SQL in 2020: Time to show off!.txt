Four years ago, the Apache Flink community started adding SQL support to ease and unify the processing of static and streaming data. Today, Flink runs business critical batch and streaming SQL queries at Alibaba, Huawei, Lyft, Uber, Yelp, and many others. Although the community made significant progress in the past years, there are still many things on the roadmap and the development is still speeding up. In the past months, several significant improvements and extensions were added including support for DDL statements, refactorings of the type system and the catalog interface, as well as Apache Hive integration. Since it is difficult to follow all development efforts that happen around Flink SQL and its ecosystem, it is time for an update. This session will focus on a comprehensive demo of what is possible with Flink SQL in 2020. Based on a realistic use case scenario, we'll show how to define tables which are backed by various storage systems and how to solve common tasks with streaming SQL queries. We will demonstrate Flink's Hive integration and show how to define and use user-defined functions. We'll close the session with an outlook of upcoming features.
