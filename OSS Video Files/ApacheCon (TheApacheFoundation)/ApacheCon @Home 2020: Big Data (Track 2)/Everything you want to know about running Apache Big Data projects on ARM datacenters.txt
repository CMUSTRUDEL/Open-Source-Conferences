With more and more vendors starts to provide ARM based chips, PCs and datacenters, more and more people starts to think about the portability of Apache big data projects running on ARM based hardwares: Will it run? How will it perform? Are there any difference running on different platforms? In this session, we will introduce what we have done in the past years to make Apache Big Data projects be able to running on ARM platforms, including the problems we sloved, how did we add CIs to related projects to provide a long-term ARM support, and what are the remaining gaps in projects like Hadoop, Spark, Hive, HBase, Kudu etc., these general ideas can provide very useful information for users, devlopers and other projects that are intrested to verify thier portability on ARM platforms. We will also introduce some of our comparison results between running Big Data cluster on ARM datacenter and x86 datacenters, together with some improvement ideas which could make Big Data projects perform better on ARM datacenters.
