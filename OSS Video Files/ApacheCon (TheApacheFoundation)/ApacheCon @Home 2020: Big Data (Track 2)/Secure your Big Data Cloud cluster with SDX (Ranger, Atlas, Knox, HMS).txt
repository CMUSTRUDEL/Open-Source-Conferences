Security is very important aspect whether it is onprem or cloud infrastructure. we are here to discuss about how can we secure our DWX/Data science/Data mart cluster with SDX/Data lake. Data Lake security and governance is managed by a shared set of services referred to as a Data Lake cluster. A Data Lake cluster includes the following services: Hive MetaStore (HMS) -- table metadata Apache Ranger -- fine-grained authorization policies, auditing Apache Atlas -- metadata management and governance: lineage, analytics, attributes Apache Knox: Authenticating Proxy for Web UIs and HTTP APIs -- SSO IDBroker -- identity federation; cloud credentials this talk will explain how can we secure multiple workload using single/shared datalake and what are the configuration we need to take care, and how each of the apache open source component like Ranger, atlas, knox helps in this case.
