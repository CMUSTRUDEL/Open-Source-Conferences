	After NoSQL discover CloudSQL databases

Application without persistence are rare and since some years the persistence layer is changing a lot. After years where SQL databases where the only ones, we saw NoSQL popping up bringing new concepts. More recently, the cloud changed again our paradigms with distributed computing and microservices. However, even with these brand new solutions, we still lack the flexibility of the SQL in terms of evolutivity and tooling. This is where HerdDB is entering into the game. Built as a SQL database, its foundations are Apache BookKeeper (bookie for close friends) and Apache Calcite. Therefore it brings to our architecture new solutions. This talk will first go through the challenges which led to creating HerdDB, then how it is designed and why it merges the best of both NoSQL and SQL worlds and finally we will illustrate its usage by two applications using very different deployment modes (from plain old bare metal to Kubernetes) using Apache Meecrowave and Geronimo Microprofile Stack.
