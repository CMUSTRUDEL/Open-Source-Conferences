good morning everybody how is the

00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:15,480
hangover gels really okay this is me the

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,840
one with the right arrow I look like my

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,750
dad I just checked with the audio guys

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,600
born in 73 raised in Holland live in

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:28,050
holland as you can see married three

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:32,570
kids working for sure by fellows and i

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:36,149
got myself into IT when I was about 18

00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:38,370
but i'm actually a corporate

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:42,059
communications guy and that's what I

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,980
studied and because a lot of issues nitr

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,800
not IT issues but communication says you

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,890
I ended up there and I stayed there

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,690
which was fine I love it over there in

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,860
three time I tried to be a long-distance

00:00:51,690 --> 00:01:00,210
swimmer the long works the swimming

00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:04,439
sometimes if you want to find me on

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:07,380
Twitter nothing special going on twitter

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,570
by the way but then it says lena store

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:13,260
votes on the slide and that is Sebastian

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:15,750
so Sebastian approached me I think a one

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,509
and a half month ago are you going to

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,299
Denver and I said well I don't know and

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,280
it is far it is 15-hour flight and we

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,110
busy at the office and he said well well

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,340
but you might have to do the keynote

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:32,820
over there oh and how come he said well

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,189
we asked some other guy and we are not

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,770
quite sure if he can make it and I said

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:41,909
well who is that some other guy that's a

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:45,119
strike true so that means two things

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:48,799
either I'm almost just as important as

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,210
Linus Torvalds or the most probable one

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,799
that this community is not that big yet

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:58,259
and they can't find anybody for a

00:01:52,799 --> 00:02:04,560
keynote and I think it's the letter so

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:08,190
back to me mi did that pixel and what

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,340
does it mean and it I came up with this

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:14,490
slide because

00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:16,530
in my childhood I was a bit different if

00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:20,490
my entire class supported I arcs that is

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:22,290
football not soccer I was favoring I

00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,750
acts as well but I choose psv eindhoven

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,910
stead and the only reason was because

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:31,430
all the other guys picked IX I exam

00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:34,770
Saddam and that happened more often and

00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:36,960
later I found my football squad the

00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:41,940
local football team and later a new

00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:44,280
study I was all always the lonely guy or

00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:48,330
or at least the guy that was different

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:51,780
and then after my study I finally found

00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:54,150
a group of people that were more and

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,780
more like me think before you say

00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:02,460
something don't brag about a lot of

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:09,200
stuff do hard work because you like it

00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:13,560
do it together and that meant that I'm

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,170
finally since i started in IT with a

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,360
bunch of people that really connect with

00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:21,980
me that interact with me where I felt

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:24,300
feel at ease and maybe you've seen the

00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,460
by the way that the second photo on the

00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:29,040
bottom that is the life of brian and

00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:32,070
maybe you know the scene that that Jesus

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,710
opens the windows after a night that

00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:36,960
Jesus normally doesn't have and he opens

00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:39,750
the windows and the entire crowd is

00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,480
there in the street and he says go home

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,730
you're all individuals and one guy says

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,209
I'm not so sometimes I have the feeling

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:50,880
that the I'm not guy sometimes I was a

00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:53,700
feeling I'm the I'm the crowd I don't go

00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:57,650
into the eggs that might be turning out

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,650
in political discussion so skip that one

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,310
then back to November in November we had

00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,670
the classic collaboration conference in

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:12,030
Amsterdam the keynote there on the

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:15,090
second day on five o'clock was done by

00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:18,979
Mark Hinkel and he talked about the why

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:23,610
of cloud sack and the why of cloud zac

00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:26,129
was going to simon Sinek

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:28,770
and we will probably have seen the

00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:34,169
YouTube videos about him the why davai

00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:36,629
davai and if you think about it he

00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:37,830
talked there about the human aspect he

00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:41,580
talked that a lot the boy with the

00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:44,580
robotic arm and he talked there about

00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:48,030
the fact that open source software and

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:50,250
people doing it are slowly but surely

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:53,699
changing the world and he talked there

00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:57,300
about living meaningful lives and I

00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:59,250
faked figured that was so inspiring the

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,349
talk and it was exactly what the

00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,060
conference needed because we're all of

00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:04,860
course technical talks technical talks

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,490
hackathons and this was the human aspect

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:11,370
of it it's totally completed the

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:14,550
conference back then but the why of

00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:17,120
course is beautiful live meaningful

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:21,360
lives what as we say in Dutch the

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:24,150
chimney must smoke and that means that

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,430
you must have enough money to have your

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,560
business up and running so meaningful

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:33,810
life is beautiful but it is also a

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:36,539
luxury the two sentences i got from his

00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:38,339
presentation i put him here of course I

00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:39,839
cannot give his entire presentation from

00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:43,349
half an hour in one minute so I won't do

00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:47,729
it but he is very proud of the of the

00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:52,589
community and the people in their go

00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:57,500
creating and sharing the group of people

00:05:52,589 --> 00:06:00,719
I found and the way we are doing things

00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:04,289
changed rather drastically in the last

00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:07,199
three years three years ago we have had

00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:08,580
a summit in the company and it is not

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,759
about my company but it's about the

00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:14,460
summit it was based upon a theory called

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,990
appreciative inquiry where Dave Cooper

00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:20,819
either maybe you heard of it maybe you

00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:22,919
don't and and basically he says you have

00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:25,319
to open up you have to open up as a

00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:28,680
company you have to open up of his

00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,479
people and you have to know what you're

00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,050
doing and why you're doing it and he

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:36,230
said the first phase of doing that is

00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:41,080
the discovery phase

00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:44,570
please open up your mind and let new IDs

00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:48,140
get it into you don't don't judge them

00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:50,090
too fast think about them and then go to

00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:52,070
the second day the second stage and

00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,260
let's dream about them what are you

00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:56,540
dreams what were the most beautiful

00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:59,510
things that happened in your life what

00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:04,250
made you going what kept you going what

00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:05,810
is turning you on and that face is so

00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,420
important because if that's what you can

00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,160
do in your work then you have the best

00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,860
the best position the best place the

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,320
best job ever and then the last two

00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,960
phases are building and deploying the

00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,970
stuff and really making sure that you

00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,820
deliver and of course that is the hard

00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:24,020
part the dreaming is fun and ice but we

00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,420
all know that the devil is in the

00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:28,130
details that was three years ago we did

00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,750
a dance company but we did it not only

00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:34,160
with our company we did it together with

00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:36,740
our customers our partners journalists

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,620
and it was an amazing experience because

00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:43,670
it is scary to discuss the future of

00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:46,910
your company with all outsiders but what

00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:48,800
happens is that all those people start

00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:53,090
dreaming the same things as we were

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,520
dreaming the all those people said you

00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:57,980
guys have to do things differently but

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,420
you already know it that was the moment

00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,920
that we started building the cloud we

00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:08,450
were in the early stages then three

00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:11,450
years ago it is also the one step back

00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:14,600
but you see as well now especially after

00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:16,730
the credit crisis and I don't believe

00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,310
its credit crisis I think it is a crisis

00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:21,800
of trust it is a crisis that people

00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:24,380
don't believe large entities anymore

00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,870
because every time you do you get messed

00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,820
around with you can't trust people that

00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:32,720
your finance you can't trust people with

00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:35,479
your private information and that's even

00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:40,190
exaggerated by the post Snowden era

00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:42,710
where we are now people want to have

00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,660
real connections you have the business

00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:47,720
to business business to consumer but

00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,980
nowadays you hear human to human and I

00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,540
think that is

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,699
really happening on a higher level as

00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,680
well the economy is changing and this is

00:08:52,699 --> 00:09:00,949
still early but in the long run I think

00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:02,600
this will happen so we start with

00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:05,930
classic this is the stuff you probably

00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,990
know three days in a row classic best

00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:12,139
bang for the buck it works it scales it

00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:15,470
runs the community is great you're all

00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:22,519
here all the things that open source

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:25,550
could wish for and yet there is still

00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:27,860
some things to do our assignment back

00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:31,850
then was and then I've talked enough

00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:34,370
about our elderly and if you want to do

00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:36,860
things differently we should build a

00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:40,190
cloud that is different than we are used

00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:43,190
to do we were a vmware company so the

00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:45,230
easy step for us would be install fee

00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:47,660
clouds have some training and kept keep

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:50,300
going now is that we are going to do

00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:52,610
things totally different we've got one I

00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,620
have an environment that can be

00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:57,949
controlled with an API that is secure

00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:00,199
reboost scalable and the last sentence

00:09:57,949 --> 00:10:02,449
got us into trouble by the way don't use

00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:05,120
anything you have used before but it

00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:07,339
also got us into the situation where we

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,290
are in now we are in a situation that we

00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:11,660
are part of this community and back then

00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:14,149
we were not we are in the situation that

00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,980
we learned a lot of new things we are in

00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:18,889
a situation that our entire company is

00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:22,810
transforming a transitioning because of

00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:26,630
opening up and being part of communities

00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:29,959
but that is us and then something

00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:32,930
totally different two weeks ago I went

00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:34,610
with some colleagues to I must read it

00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:37,069
because otherwise you can't make it up

00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:39,470
right the pre commercial procurement

00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:42,350
project for the cloud for your market

00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:48,050
consultation and there's a typo in there

00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:51,350
it was last week not next entry and it

00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:53,589
was an afternoon we got into the in the

00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:56,120
Rye Amsterdam the conference center

00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:59,410
there was a room half the size of this

00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,410
packed with suit

00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:07,490
and I didn't feel at home they were

00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:11,680
talking about how do I get my money fast

00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:15,500
and they said it impolite sentence like

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:18,680
dear mr. commissioner what is the budget

00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:22,310
for this pre-commercial face when can we

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:26,060
subscribed to the RFP what happens with

00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:27,350
my intellectual property rights and the

00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,450
European Commission was there with a

00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,250
totally different reason days they asked

00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,200
two things and they asked us to think

00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:38,209
about it what are the gaps in our

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:41,959
approach and on the on the business

00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:43,519
processes in the European Union which of

00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:46,670
those do you want to have automated in a

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:50,720
cloud so everybody got a three minute

00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:54,290
pitch and in all companies names like

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,630
Cisco artists shop they got on state and

00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:59,930
they did the product page this is my

00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:01,730
cloud it works at the ranch is great the

00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:04,820
next one this is my cloud it is even

00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:07,910
better bigger greater cheaper and it was

00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:11,540
quite embarrassing to be honest because

00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:13,339
it was totally opposite of what they

00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,070
were asking but also how we think that

00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:17,209
we should do things so if you look at

00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:20,149
the clouds for Europe they have a

00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:24,050
steering board the prime minister of

00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:28,040
Estonia is chairing the board in his

00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:30,920
board yes the CEO of sup he has the CEO

00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:38,079
of software are gay he has the van of

00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:41,089
holes he has Accenture mercedes-benz

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:46,100
some member states in the European Union

00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:49,100
and what we said in our page or in a

00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,899
three minute set but I'm missing here is

00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,459
the open source community in your

00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:54,110
steering board what I'm missing here is

00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:56,360
the startup community in this board

00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:58,160
because if you go back to the to the

00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,140
presentation of Mark Hinkel in in

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,670
November all the innovation is happening

00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:04,070
or most of the innovation is happening

00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:07,190
in those areas and if you don't let them

00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:08,920
in in your steering board how are you

00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:11,899
going to do the things differently then

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,120
but on the other hand who are you going

00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:15,960
to invite

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,450
startup number one thousand eleven or

00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:22,720
open-source community member 55 and

00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:25,029
that's difficult so they listen to us

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,000
and they agreed with us but they also

00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:30,490
have the issue FL where do I turn to I

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,520
can't go anywhere near can't come to

00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:35,320
invite some bloke and he cannot speak on

00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,620
behalf of the entire op source community

00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:41,680
doesn't work like that the other thing

00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:45,310
that was being discussed there is a lot

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:50,589
about the intellectual property right if

00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:52,330
you look at the new way of procurement

00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:54,610
in the European urine they split it up

00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:56,770
he faces and after every face they can

00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:59,200
select a new vendor so every vendor

00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:00,790
asked yeah but how do I protect my knees

00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,950
like the property of the previous phase

00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:06,700
if I'm not quite sure if I get the next

00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:10,330
phase as well and and they're the same

00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:12,040
the same item happened that people are

00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:15,940
still believing that they should protect

00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:18,100
and push the outside world away and that

00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,320
was that's that's the reason why I put

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,240
up the slide because we are not there

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,000
yet this is how they are really thinking

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:28,510
and by the way we we were the only one

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,560
not wearing suit and by the way we had

00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:34,450
one guy maybe no offense he made a

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,160
statement about open sores and a guy

00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:38,380
from Cisco I know his name but I won't i

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,940
would say they would not be fair he said

00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,740
well like this gentleman from sugar

00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,580
fellow set and friends got up from his

00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:47,310
chair he said that's not what I said

00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:50,260
you're lying and you're not listening

00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:52,300
and that was great because it totally

00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:55,000
broke open the entire atmosphere and

00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:57,130
everybody was like a there are different

00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,870
people in this room this time every time

00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:01,089
it is yes Prime Minister yes

00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:05,440
commissioner so that was a really fun

00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:07,750
thing to do last week I was in the

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,270
seminar breakfast seminar black dog and

00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:14,920
allen & overy it was a very good seminar

00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:20,400
by the way it was about lawyers and open

00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:20,400
source software in the room all suits

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:27,940
in the room discussions about mergers

00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:29,649
and acquisitions how do i value the code

00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:34,089
that is written in this company if I buy

00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:35,890
this company in practice it a lot of

00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:38,640
organization say we do not use open

00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:40,839
source if black does Duke does the scan

00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:43,720
thirty percent of all code is open

00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:46,500
source it's being included by developers

00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:50,230
it is running on the open source systems

00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,730
but there is not a policy in those

00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:54,730
companies that they are using open

00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:56,560
source so when they are buying or

00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,940
selling the company then all of a sudden

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,490
it becomes an issue and then they start

00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:03,820
thinking about it but before that they

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:05,260
are not really interested in how it is

00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,610
happening because the deadline is more

00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,560
important than the developer needs to

00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:10,540
meet the deadline and if he does it by

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,190
using open source it's fine and if he

00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:16,260
does it by using his own code it is fine

00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:18,820
as well but they do not think about

00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:20,950
maybe it is better if a developer uses

00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:23,470
open source because he knows how to get

00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:25,450
the stuff done not on his own but being

00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:28,870
as a part of a member of a community and

00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:30,790
if you are protecting everything again

00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:34,140
you have to do it on your own or with a

00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:37,930
bunch of colleagues the other thing was

00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:40,779
again intellectual property rights they

00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:43,839
asked all kinds of questions about and

00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:47,140
now I have to memorize it I believe 750

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:52,660
different open source licenses of its 22

00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:55,240
are frequently used and they are all not

00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,520
only now they don't even know they exist

00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,779
they don't even know what they mean but

00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:03,430
they are asking questions about it and

00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:05,500
some of the people in the room like like

00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:09,250
a big chip maker from the Netherlands

00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:11,260
banks they said to be honest we don't

00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,760
ask those questions if it is commercial

00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:18,520
software so why are we asking these

00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:22,150
questions now make me wonder the third

00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,380
one arm and I went to England it's

00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:27,429
always a nice trip to England because

00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:29,710
you can have lunch with Giles but what

00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:32,350
if it was more fun we vent that because

00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:33,880
of a bit by the way we lost a bit I'm

00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:37,300
still angry about it

00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:40,540
it's just not fair but that argument

00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:43,530
doesn't work so well and we've entered

00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:45,970
coffee week to go of that you came

00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:48,340
during the bed at eleven in the evening

00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:50,470
we were working in the office and I

00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:53,260
mailed my bracken maybe you've seen his

00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:55,420
talk about Code for America about golf

00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,560
the UK and I mailed him Mike we are

00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,690
working here with a bit for the

00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,820
government can we drop by so we can

00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:02,620
listen to your story how you did it we

00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:05,820
want to listen to how you change culture

00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:09,160
and how you transform your organization

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:12,130
50 minutes later I had the answer you're

00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:16,020
more than welcome my agenda aspect but

00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:18,520
my team is there for you please drop by

00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:27,280
that is bit different than the previous

00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:29,560
two right we got there and it was like

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,030
coming home that's feeling you see the

00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:34,060
picture here that is on the walls and

00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:37,990
the entire offices is full with scrum

00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:41,320
boards with creativity with planning

00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:44,380
with measurements about the websites and

00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:47,590
two guys one guy and one girl there talk

00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:52,270
to us Jos Russell and a BPO and just

00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:54,490
said the first thing we did is we need

00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:56,650
to work with a lot more companies that

00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:58,930
understand what we are doing currently

00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:00,190
we are in a position that we have in the

00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:03,070
past we were in the position that we

00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:05,230
work with five companies and we are

00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:07,420
stuck it's costing too much money we

00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:11,800
can't go forward we can't go backward we

00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:13,270
have to cut money by 1.5 billion in 2015

00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,460
that's the amount of money we're talking

00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:18,120
about so things must go drastically

00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:23,500
different and what they did is they

00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:25,510
assigned a digital officer I don't know

00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,150
this correct function title but he was

00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:31,120
crossed departamento so he was above the

00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:34,060
ministries which meant that he was able

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,910
to design new business processes with

00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:39,940
his teams and they started with the most

00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:45,160
frequently used and that was earmarking

00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:47,620
your livestock and they got so much gain

00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:51,130
from it that the momentum was was gone

00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:52,840
going very quickly and then they did it

00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:55,270
they came up with something new and that

00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:58,090
is the show and tell like the demo or

00:19:55,270 --> 00:20:01,120
dying in scrum but the show-and-tell is

00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:04,030
done by people in the top so people in

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,610
the top have to the demo but they are

00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:09,880
well especially in the government not

00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:12,760
the most IT savvy guys so the designers

00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:15,930
and the developers makes they could make

00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:19,750
websites that are so easy to use that

00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:21,550
those those top managers can do the demo

00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:24,370
or die and those top managers are afraid

00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:26,679
of failing demo so they reach out to the

00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:28,179
developers and they skip all the middle

00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:29,830
management and say hey what are you

00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:31,809
building Kaiba show me can I draw by

00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:34,570
friday four o'clock and and see what

00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:37,510
you're doing and the mailman shizz there

00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:40,179
are in the squeeze but the energy and

00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:43,270
the way they are doing this is way more

00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:44,770
like we like to do it as a company but

00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:47,440
also we like to do it as a community

00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:49,660
opening up do it together share your

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,850
expectations share your dream share

00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:57,220
share your lessons learned what are you

00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:58,990
pitfalls so we got home very happy today

00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:02,490
after we heard that we didn't get the

00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:08,500
deal so we throwing everything away of

00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:13,350
course not if I talk to my customers and

00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:17,170
I ask them what is your hopes or policy

00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:19,990
they say they don't have one they are

00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:24,580
scared and they are scared because they

00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:29,110
don't know what it is linux and apache

00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:33,790
vector that's pretty safe but everything

00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:37,410
else what if it is abandoned what if i

00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:40,330
don't know what the license means and

00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:44,860
the people are they reliable they grow

00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:46,690
beards this is one week i think i do it

00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,030
for another week just to shock the

00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:54,760
enterprise

00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:59,020
Oh dead pixel again there were funny

00:21:54,760 --> 00:22:02,670
t-shirts not today so they don't know

00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:06,190
and they are scared but who is there to

00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:08,230
tell them that it should be done

00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:11,260
differently and that you don't need to

00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:13,710
be scared and there is a big big hole

00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:19,240
and we can tell them as super Phyllis

00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:21,130
and we do but we are only a small entity

00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,410
in the Netherlands and what is the what

00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:25,210
is the impact that we have on the global

00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:28,750
economy that is of course next to next

00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:31,390
to nothing but what we also learned with

00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:33,790
our custom video editor prices is that

00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:36,610
those people are not that different than

00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:40,150
I on non-aryan they just have different

00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:41,370
dreams they have different visions they

00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,510
want to work in different environments

00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:45,130
but every morning when they go to the

00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:47,350
office they want to do something good

00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:51,070
they want to have meaningful lives as

00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:53,110
well they want to go home with a good

00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:56,860
feeling that they are a little bit

00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:59,080
better than the day before so if that's

00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:03,790
all the same and only the dreams are

00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:06,700
different might be maybe we are in the

00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:09,070
position to bridge that gap I don't know

00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:12,330
how yet but we are here with a group of

00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:16,060
people so probably you can help me now

00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:19,570
and I think this this is sums it up

00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:21,250
quite nicely who's playing golf with the

00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:24,940
cio in the last six months can I see

00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:27,310
some hands nobody i think maybe Giles No

00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:33,789
sebastiaan you're playing go with the

00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:37,330
cio why not hmm

00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:40,619
yeah can you fix it thing but if we are

00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:44,169
not playing over those guys by the way I

00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:45,580
got my golf license and then in the

00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:48,009
nettle as you have to have a license and

00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:49,479
I suck at it so bad that I don't even

00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:54,279
want to be seen at the golf course with

00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:56,109
the CI a-- but what if we are not

00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:59,590
playing golf in the cio somebody else is

00:23:56,109 --> 00:24:04,710
and you know what they show them they

00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:08,529
show them this blood red oracle slides

00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:11,109
they show them vmware slides they show

00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:12,429
them abs origin slides which is not bad

00:24:11,109 --> 00:24:16,659
of course because they have a business

00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:18,999
to run but what the bad thing is is that

00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:23,320
they don't show they don't see the

00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:27,220
clouds like slides they are not being

00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:29,559
told by a trustworthy partner that it is

00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:32,499
the right thing to do there's only one

00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:34,450
exception there and that is luckily we

00:24:32,499 --> 00:24:36,519
have citrix because Cedric's is doing

00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:39,909
that what citrix is having a hard time

00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:42,460
as well I had to call earlier this year

00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:45,609
with Samir and Mark and I believe Steve

00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:48,399
Wilson was in there as well about this

00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:50,470
topic and I know that that few members

00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:52,659
of the PMC are worried about this and I

00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:55,259
I talked about it in our company we are

00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:57,759
worried about it selling netscaler

00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:59,649
extend desktop external is something

00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:03,190
different than selling a cloud product

00:24:59,649 --> 00:25:05,919
and a cloud product is not the next

00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:07,539
version of a virtualized environment so

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,389
you must come in with a different vision

00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:12,609
in a different board meeting with

00:25:10,389 --> 00:25:15,639
different people and that's the hard

00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:18,759
thing to do and I think the length and

00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:20,470
expand method that rick is doing

00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:22,619
now is the right thing to do because

00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:25,210
they keep close to their strength and

00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:27,820
from on top of that they can build it

00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:31,090
out but I'm quite worried there as well

00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:32,979
because build it out means that there is

00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:35,379
the next step and who is telling them

00:25:32,979 --> 00:25:40,269
what the next step is again the same

00:25:35,379 --> 00:25:42,909
issue I think so what do we then as a

00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:47,950
company how do we sell classic well we

00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:49,899
don't that's strange we have multiple

00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:52,600
customers running in the cloud we have

00:25:49,899 --> 00:25:56,139
bangs running in a cloud but we don't

00:25:52,600 --> 00:26:00,059
sell it because what we sell as an IT

00:25:56,139 --> 00:26:03,010
outsourcer is a reliability security

00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:06,070
scalability all the big benefits that

00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:11,470
everybody wants to have but we don't

00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:14,260
sell cloud sac and that means that we

00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:15,580
are also not in a position and maybe I

00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:18,309
can push it a little bit better and

00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:20,799
maybe I can make a nice presentation for

00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:22,360
the enterprise architect and of course

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,120
we need to convince them that classicism

00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,799
is a safe way of going forward because

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:31,330
they have their internal possible

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:37,779
policies as well but in the end we are

00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:40,480
also not doing so to summarize I think

00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:43,269
we have a few things to do to fix and

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,549
those are not exactly the same but

00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:47,710
yesterday there was a talk by by Mark

00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:51,389
and Giles in the in your room or maybe

00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:53,649
in this room and it is split it again I

00:26:51,389 --> 00:26:55,600
think we should be ourselves the

00:26:53,649 --> 00:26:58,149
community community should keep to its

00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,090
strengths this is great the people are

00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:03,010
great the social interaction is great of

00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:06,190
course we want to grow it a little bit

00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:09,789
because it is self-sufficient and but

00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:11,590
don't be do anything different don't let

00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:14,889
yourself into doing things that you're

00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:16,659
wrong in or rather bed in keep doing the

00:27:14,889 --> 00:27:18,190
things that you're very good at because

00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:24,429
that's what's keeping you going that is

00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:28,120
dreaming or living your dream I think we

00:27:24,429 --> 00:27:33,039
should seek some parties that can act as

00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:36,340
a trusted advisor to the CIO yeah

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,870
consultants is the ugly word because

00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:41,080
they're only in there for the money more

00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:42,760
hours more hours more hours but some of

00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,340
them are different we talked with

00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,690
example gave an 80 kearney they don't do

00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,760
anything on hourly basis they do

00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:51,010
everything fixed price oh that's

00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,840
interesting why are doing it different

00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:55,690
oh we are not conservatives we solve

00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:58,750
problems for customers hey that's more

00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:00,010
like us so I think it can be done we

00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,340
have to look for them and we must have

00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,960
time for them to

00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:06,290
work with them and come up with some

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:09,020
information that they can work with the

00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:11,980
third you must have some material to

00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:15,140
present classic as a viable alternative

00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:17,420
if I have to do it now I take the cloud

00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:20,030
platform slides and I use a lot of it

00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:22,370
and then I redo it in a manner that it

00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:25,010
is a CloudStack presentation but it is

00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:28,040
best effort and I'm as you can see not

00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:29,630
the best guy with PowerPoint so you

00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:33,770
should trust me with this important

00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:37,550
stuff I think there should be a

00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:40,660
governing body CloudStack foundation

00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:42,920
classic foundation classic vonage sorry

00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:44,330
now it shouldn't be loud so funny it

00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,800
should be a governing body and if it is

00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:47,420
the apache foundation i'm fine with it

00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,950
if it is the linux foundation i'm fine

00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,200
with it if it is the classic foundation

00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:54,620
i'm fine with it as long as it meets the

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,960
goals and the goals are as especially

00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:59,000
this we need to have some white papers

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,950
we need to have some we need to have a

00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,540
magic quadrant as well and I don't like

00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,400
building one and creating man but

00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:07,310
somebody needs to talk to Gardner about

00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:09,380
it somebody needs to go to forrester we

00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:13,250
have a number of those analysts and they

00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:15,860
are very friendly to us but really

00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:17,680
putting their that time and effort in is

00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:23,330
something different and they should have

00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:26,420
one face to talk to the first one is on

00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:29,420
the technical level if you have red hat

00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:31,790
and OpenStack and that's the first thing

00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:35,060
you learn about cloud why should you

00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:36,740
leave if the first thing you know is

00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:39,290
there's a package on the internet and it

00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:41,150
is Java cloud thick and it has a very

00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:45,080
easy easy installer and it runs on

00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:47,630
virtually any device that would make

00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,580
things i think a lot better if people

00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:52,070
have a cloud product in one evening and

00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:54,440
they use it and it is nice they will

00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:58,210
keep using it because they like it it is

00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:00,470
easy they can show it the next day i

00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:02,180
think this is very important one because

00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:04,520
if the young people and the new

00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:06,200
engineers are growing up with cloud

00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:09,730
slack they're not growing up with
