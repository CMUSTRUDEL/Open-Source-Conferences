I'm curious how many of you have used

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:09,240
the dev cloud virtual machine before

00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:14,190
okay and how many of you have used the

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:16,650
kvm specific devcloud okay so for those

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:20,850
of you who are familiar with either one

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:24,510
of those a lot of this will be common

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:27,840
knowledge you know very familiar a lot

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:33,329
of the details between the two the Zen

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,680
version in the kvm version overlap for

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,350
those of you who aren't familiar i hope

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,780
that you get the you get kind of a basic

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:48,270
groundwork in how to do development in

00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:51,239
you know in a quicker quicker way by not

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:55,160
having to have a full you know physical

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,160
infrastructure to just to do development

00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:00,660
so yeah the purpose is to familiarize

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,210
you guys with development on your

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,549
workstation not have to you know spin up

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:10,560
a large environment to do some testing

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:12,570
and basic development the prerequisites

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,330
for it you have to have a computer that

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,430
has a decent amount of memory you know

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,729
you're going to be running a vm that has

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,570
to run VMs inside of it so it's nice to

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:23,570
