okay I'll go ahead and get started I'll

00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,990
at least get the introductions and some

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:09,570
of this other stuff out of the way so we

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:14,250
good on ooh we good on recording and

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:18,270
everything else awesome okay what I want

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:21,180
to talk today about is the concept of

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,519
matching application types to the

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:27,029
underlying infrastructure and how that

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:30,199
relates back to CloudStack and in this

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:34,010
instance today cloud platform as well a

00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:36,630
little bit of background briefly um

00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:40,079
because this might be slightly confusing

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:42,570
I i worked for citrix until very

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,850
recently monday was my first day

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,360
actually in SolidFire so that's why this

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:52,140
presentation is very citric centric and

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,850
I'm actually a very thankful to citrix

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,300
for a little allowing me to use the demo

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,469
lab for for the large portion of this

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,719
lab because it would have been very

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:05,489
difficult to do without access to the

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,689
lab um but expectations and Jenna I'm

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,689
just gonna have like I just have one or

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:12,350
two just slides on cloud computing and

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:15,150
where I think this is going in and why

00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:18,590
cloudstack and cloud platform and then

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,000
go into this duel workload scenario of

00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,549
traditional applications versus cloud

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,650
applications and then lastly do a demo

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,600
the demo actually is a decent portion of

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,270
this presentation so so not a lot of

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,189
slides here and and hopefully a lot more

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,409
lab time and actually if you guys want

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:35,850
to kind of play around a little bit live

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,549
let me know and we can certainly do

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:41,250
other things before I get started on

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:43,950
that if you don't mind though for

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,920
everyone that's in the room how would

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,329
you describe your applications today and

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,060
your hypervisors you in your

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:53,759
environments today you know when I when

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,610
I say it's like traditional applications

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,950
where it sits virtualization it's it's

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,469
using vlans within your organization's

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,079
it's using you know management servers

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:06,630
and enterprise-class storage and sands

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,759
it does that represent some folks in

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,550
here quick show hands who is that or nod

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,860
your heads and okay and then when I say

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,810
kind of cloud applications of

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,090
applications that are specifically built

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,010
to kind of scale out scale up and do

00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:25,650
much more dynamic kind of things is that

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:28,770
anybody today okay I don't get a lot of

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,750
that just yet um because I really think

00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:34,410
we're in a state of transition and that

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:36,270
leads into this slide of where are we

00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:40,440
versus where are we going and then how

00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:43,380
can CloudStack help you to both kind of

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,030
absorb your existing applications into

00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,130
an infrastructure and manage them today

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,230
and then get to where potentially the

00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,090
market is going tomorrow as well so we

00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,550
started way back when with with just

00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,410
basic clouds and those clouds were what

00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,090
i would call very general purpose clouds

00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:00,000
kind of built for for one use

00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,530
specifically and that really was the

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,370
realm of service providers then we moved

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:07,110
on to an area where you started to go

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,360
the exact opposite of its really

00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,860
greenfield clouds and enterprises want

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,450
to stand up these greenfield clouds but

00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,820
at the same time still wanted to

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,730
integrate with existing in-house

00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:20,100
solutions so you had this weird state of

00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:23,880
this is what I have versus where I want

00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:25,620
to go and I don't necessarily match that

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,260
infrastructure to the applications at

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,739
times and and now we're moving into this

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,360
idea of more hybrid clouds and matching

00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,680
that application type to the

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,160
infrastructure type which is what we're

00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:41,910
going to talk about today um only slide

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:46,019
on citrix I promise but what we have

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:47,900
here is those raw resources very

00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:50,730
traditionally Network compute storage

00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,549
being consumed or abstract it away by

00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:56,940
some type of hypervisor typically with

00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:58,530
CloudStack for us personally we're

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,590
seeing a lot of xenserver with that and

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:04,560
then that cloud orchestration layer that

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,480
is placed on top of it so cloud platform

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,239
powered of course by Apache CloudStack

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,390
typically and then if you want to get to

00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:15,680
that that self service delivery kind of

00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:18,450
portal aspect of how do you create

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,000
service offerings show a Service Catalog

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:23,370
and then either charge back our show

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,260
back that consumption of resources to

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,849
your users is actually cloud portal

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,270
business manager that we typically lay

00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:31,560
on top

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:36,690
of that as well um I get the question a

00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:40,379
lot of why CloudStack ry cloud platform

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,909
and actually everyone kind of likes to

00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:43,379
throw up the logo slides but the reason

00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:45,690
why I want to throw up this logo slide

00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:48,300
actually is because i feel like the

00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:50,280
CloudStack community logo slide is very

00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,139
different than a lot of the other

00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,780
products that are out there the reason

00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:58,409
being again because we can absorb both

00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,449
types of workloads you have both kinds

00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:03,229
of logos represented here you have

00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:05,220
service providers up here you have cloud

00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:07,650
application folks up here you have

00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,620
traditional enterprises up here this is

00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:12,780
a very broad mix of logos instead of

00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:16,440
just one type of workload of logos and

00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:19,889
another type of logos um which leads me

00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,090
into what do I mean by this let's dig

00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:25,530
into this a little bit more when I say

00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:28,590
traditional um what I really mean is is

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:31,080
think server virtualization where that

00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:35,669
underlying infrastructure is typically

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:37,800
very highly available youryour redundant

00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:40,770
networking redundant servers redundant

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,630
hypervisors in a cluster redundant sand

00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:47,009
storage with lots of redundant disks and

00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:49,110
dual heads and if any anything fails you

00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:51,509
know quite frankly application doesn't

00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:54,889
handle it well it will go down and go

00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:57,690
down hard typically and because of that

00:05:54,889 --> 00:06:00,090
the administrator typically has to hit

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,099
the big red button of yes I want to

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:04,110
failover I something happen and I need

00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:05,819
to go somewhere else to some other kind

00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,610
of infrastructure so a lot of times you

00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:10,080
have two sets of identical highly

00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,840
available infrastructure is how things

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,650
are typically done versus in this cloud

00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,500
workload era um things are designed for

00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:20,940
failure that application is designed

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,190
fundamentally differently it is designed

00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:26,219
to be dynamic scale up and scale out as

00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:30,569
well as if a node fails this kind of

00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:33,060
shared nothing ephemeral if a node fails

00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:35,029
who cares you kind of move that off and

00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:39,860
keep running spin up another instance

00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:44,300
and so what happens here is different

00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:47,180
application types and because of that

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,949
very different underlying application

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,169
infrastructures and this is where I

00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:53,680
start to see some problems in customers

00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:57,319
at times of they may have this

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,539
traditional infrastructure but try and

00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:03,259
put a cloud application on top of it or

00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:06,349
vice versa and so I want to go into this

00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:07,819
just a little bit of what this means if

00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:13,129
I walk over here is that cool with the

00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:15,110
camera awesome um a lot of times we have

00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:17,870
some kind of management server on top

00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:23,569
you didn't unplug the lab did you okay

00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:28,189
just check it I'm sorry okay this slide

00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:29,569
yeah 23 minutes um so that's Tim Tims in

00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:30,979
charge of the lab that I'm about to demo

00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:32,539
on the last time I did this he messed

00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:36,620
with me on purpose so that's why I asked

00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:37,909
that question um so after that you've

00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:41,060
got some kind of enterprise networking

00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:44,210
in in the enterprise what I see most

00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:47,750
often today is is layer two vlans for

00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:50,000
isolation that is both a strength and a

00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,370
weakness very proven technology that has

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,379
been around for a long time but it often

00:07:52,370 --> 00:08:00,349
is the first limit you hit 4096 vlans in

00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:03,440
na in a layer 2 domain if you're a

00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:05,210
service provider providing a VLAN per

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,460
tenant or multiple vlans per tenant or

00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:10,789
if you're a large enterprise doing VLANs

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:12,560
per application or service levels that's

00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:13,879
the first one everyone seems to scale

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,560
out no matter how much infrastructure

00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:19,009
you throw at it it's a hard limit of

00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:22,569
4096 after that you have a bunch of

00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:26,029
hypervisors in a cluster not necessarily

00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:29,599
individual servers are individual

00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:33,169
hypervisors like a kvm like scenario but

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:36,469
Zen or vSphere typically multiple ones

00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:40,610
in a cluster and then some kind of sand

00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:43,399
storage underneath that again highly

00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:47,480
availability high availability at every

00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:50,300
every step of this and failure is not an

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,819
option because if the infrastructure

00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,540
goes down typically the application

00:08:52,819 --> 00:08:55,540
falls right behind

00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,879
this is the kind of infrastructure and

00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:04,449
applications I'm starting to see more

00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:07,430
and more in test dev environments and

00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:08,810
where I really do think the future of

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:11,899
kind of software development and

00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:14,420
applications tends to be headed because

00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:16,009
of that you have some very different

00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,740
aspects here here's the security layer

00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:20,420
first of all no management server

00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:22,399
management server is just gone at this

00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,959
point yes you can still talk to it but a

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:29,689
lot of times it's more of to manage the

00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:31,910
traditional stuff thank you sir and then

00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:33,110
you're doing software-defined networking

00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,519
you start to hear a lot of around

00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,259
software-defined networking this is that

00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:38,569
that first piece of solving that problem

00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:40,189
of the layer two vlans that I was

00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:42,529
talking about earlier this is where you

00:09:40,189 --> 00:09:44,839
start to see instead of vlans for

00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:46,910
isolation you start to do security

00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:49,459
groups up at layer three you start to do

00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:54,069
a IP elastic IPS or elastic load

00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:57,920
balancing Yale be and this is all about

00:09:54,069 --> 00:10:00,470
making your network scale-out scale up

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,360
be dynamic and kind of flex and do

00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:04,730
whatever you need to do at any given

00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,379
time to support your application because

00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,870
your application and your infrastructure

00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:12,230
are much more tightly aligned now in

00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:14,000
case there are failures and then not

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:19,209
necessarily clusters of hypervisors

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,649
anymore individual servers bare metal or

00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:24,949
individual hypervisors a lot of times

00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:27,470
here and then object storage a lot of

00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:29,660
times on the back end because of the

00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:33,500
scalability of object storage and what

00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:36,980
it can provide there so again if you go

00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:44,410
from here to here very fundamentally

00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:47,540
different types of infrastructure in

00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:52,910
cloudstack terminology the best way to

00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:55,129
isolate this is to create zones so what

00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:58,089
we're basically doing is taking all of a

00:10:55,129 --> 00:11:01,429
certain type of hardware resources and

00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:04,040
combining them into a zone that we can

00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:06,529
manage and consumed within cloudstack so

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,400
we're just going to create a traditional

00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:09,970
app

00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:15,980
occasions own and a cloud native

00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:18,650
application zone so this is how we are

00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,570
able to kind of consume a lot of the

00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:22,280
traditional stuff and take those baby

00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,850
steps that we see a lot of times today

00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:27,740
and then move into those applications

00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,780
that we see tomorrow but not having to

00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:32,060
replace the cloud management

00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:36,650
infrastructure it is just about adding

00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:40,490
the more more resources as needed before

00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:41,990
I go into the demo um I just wanted to

00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:47,420
kind of again brief poll of the audience

00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:49,880
here just slightly based off of that

00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,710
what kind of what type are most folks

00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,930
and what kind of use cases he you know

00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:57,530
first of all kind of whose production

00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:59,810
versus who's you know test ever QA ish

00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:01,520
kind of environment so kind of who's

00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:05,830
doing everything kind of like this in

00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:09,140
production today right I know you are

00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:12,500
absolutely and who's kind of doing tests

00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:16,660
Devi production II I'm sorry test dev QA

00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:22,340
kind of tasks and management today oh

00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:24,680
come on huh yeah that's fine that's fine

00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,670
absolutely carrick what's yours you

00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,500
didn't raise your hand and I'm gonna

00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:32,270
pick on you you know if you come in i'm

00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:39,550
going to pick on you chew but but when

00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:39,550
when you were doing yours what was okay

00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:47,210
sure okay so so for his um and Kirk had

00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,670
a session this morning on on his

00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:51,830
environment or and kind of how he was

00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:53,650
able to really roll out that dynamic

00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:57,740
pneus of the environment but but again

00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:59,510
for him it was all about creating test

00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,060
of kind of environments and then going

00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:03,380
to production but within the same kind

00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,580
of infrastructure things and I know if

00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:09,880
you don't mind me asking were you

00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:09,880
planning to do separate zones

00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:40,080
mm-hmm yep okay and I'm actually going

00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:42,029
to go into advanced and so to repeat it

00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,490
for everyone as well as the recording

00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:47,580
the intention was to do multiple zones

00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:49,589
but there's even another use case of the

00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,470
same kinds of applications but create

00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:55,470
one zone for test em and one zone for

00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:57,240
production right and and how do you kind

00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,740
of my great things back and forth and go

00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,440
from one to the other and grow into the

00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:04,350
next one so zones are a very nice way to

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:11,070
kind of compartmentalize everything as

00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:13,380
well um and okay good yes and I didn't

00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:15,930
have any slides on it in here but but

00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:18,270
two things that he mentioned in his that

00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:22,860
that I'll go into one of them in the

00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:27,000
demo here is the concept of a basic zone

00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:30,420
or an advanced own so with a basic zone

00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,580
it is kind of that cloud native doing

00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,820
security groups and flat networking kind

00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,080
of thing to start advanced zones is

00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:40,320
really more around allowing you to do

00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,970
VLANs and do segregation that way and

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,070
then there's the concept of regions as

00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:46,320
well having gone into that at all and I

00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:49,260
don't have it set up in this demo but

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,589
regions is really the idea of multiple

00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:54,690
data centers or multiple sets in

00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:56,279
different locations so how do you

00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:59,850
actually from one management point

00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:02,390
manage multiple locations as well so

00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:06,320
thank you card preciate it with that

00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,320
I'll jump into the demo here

00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:24,380
so just to free clarity um I logged in

00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:26,870
here as myself but but i am the

00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:29,570
equivalent of kind of a root admin or a

00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:31,520
cloud admin or a domain admin on this so

00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:34,850
so this is think of this is this is the

00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:37,600
top level with this user account I'm

00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:40,070
able to see all of the resources and

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,600
some important things to note first of

00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,310
all there is an infrastructure tab which

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,210
I'm going to go into in a little bit but

00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:51,440
this dashboard is very infrastructure

00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:53,480
centric how many IPS do you have what

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,020
you know how much are you consuming in

00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,060
CPU and resources because that top level

00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:02,720
administrator that is going to be your

00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:05,660
primary function and then what I want to

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,210
show here is how do you do that logical

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,790
to physical kind of mapping that we need

00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:13,130
to do for that isolation of the zones

00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:15,200
and resources so first of all I'm going

00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:17,990
to go to a domain and there's always a

00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,970
root domain and then underneath that

00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,950
root domain we actually have one here

00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:24,080
called consumer consumer is actually for

00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:27,020
citrix cloud portal business manager

00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,340
which we have integrated in here um but

00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:32,180
for the sake of this demo today I've

00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:34,370
created a cloud apps domain and an

00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,140
enterprise apps domain and then you'll

00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:40,630
also notice I've further created

00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:42,860
subdomains called prod and Dev so again

00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:46,610
bringing back and thanks for bringing

00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:49,400
that up Kirk um here's a way I you know

00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:54,680
we could potentially take prod and Dev

00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:59,390
and sub dedicate if you will underneath

00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:02,090
our resource types and then let's say I

00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:04,699
want to include the developers in all of

00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:06,589
this but but quite frankly we need to

00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:08,540
pend them in a little bit of we don't

00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:09,560
want them to consume so many production

00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,079
resources that could they could

00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,670
potentially override production so what

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,250
we've done here is we've actually put

00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:18,380
some limits in place so they can only

00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:23,150
spin up ten instances in this

00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:26,439
environment excuse me they can only take

00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:28,880
a certain number of volumes or snapshots

00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:30,549
but in this instance if you go look at

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,169
production

00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:36,950
negative 1 negative 1 is a nice way of

00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:38,600
saying no limit so production you can do

00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,730
whatever you want it's because its

00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,899
production I don't want to limit you in

00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,429
any way shape or form but for the

00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:48,769
development environment i do want to

00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:52,549
impose some limits um apologize my

00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:56,390
throat um so this is really the way to

00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:57,799
start that that logical definition now

00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:01,010
how do you pin that against the physical

00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:05,600
hardware will go to infrastructure and

00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:08,240
you'll notice I have two zones so I

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,539
created under domains some logical

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:15,350
partitioning now zones is a physical

00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:16,909
partitioning I've got two zones here and

00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:21,980
you'll notice network type advanced our

00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:24,950
basic so in this zone 145 is my advanced

00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:28,419
zone meaning in this instance i am using

00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:33,019
VLANs and that is my traditional

00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:34,970
applications kind of zone zone 137 is a

00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:37,519
basic zone basically it's a big flat

00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:39,679
network in this instance because i'm

00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:41,960
doing the security of all of this and

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,970
the isolations at through different

00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,510
resources kind of like in almost like an

00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:50,889
Amazon AWS kind of way because that

00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:55,450
applications really fit that mindset and

00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:57,559
so if I go actually show under here

00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:01,100
physical Network and this is kind of you

00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:04,039
know its standard best practices of I'm

00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:06,799
running three VLANs here I'm isolating

00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:09,409
my storage I'm isolating my guest VMs

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,480
and I'm isolating management of them

00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:16,519
instead of combining everything onto one

00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:20,419
wire and of course I can see my

00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:23,960
resources globally for this zone so I

00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:26,240
can see what is available you'll notice

00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,980
public ip's I'm at fifty-seven percent I

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:34,429
might want to go look at that and add

00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:37,630
some more at some point are Tim will I i

00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:37,630
tend to hog the ip's

00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:43,790
um and and so this is again matching

00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,320
that infrastructure type against the

00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:53,480
kind of applications I want to run in

00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:56,590
here if I go look at 137 again huh how

00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:00,020
is that dedication or pinning of that

00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:03,530
domain to the zone happening well it's

00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:09,350
actually happening here we're dedicated

00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:11,870
yes domain cloud apps so all I've done

00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:14,600
is in the definition of this zone I've

00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:20,380
pinned it against that domain that's how

00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:23,930
we make that that isolation happen and

00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:25,910
then if I go look at this is just more

00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:27,410
of look at the way it is now because

00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:29,300
you'll see there's a lot running on this

00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:31,700
system and then I'm going to flip over

00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:35,200
to show you that isolation actually

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:37,820
happening so if I go look at instances

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,400
you'll notice there's a lot running on

00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:44,510
this system so if I keep scrolling down

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,430
keep scrolling down it keeps going the

00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:49,700
vast majority of the resources are

00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:51,470
running in zone 1 45 there is some

00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:54,530
things running in 137 these are some

00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:58,130
cloud apps but there is a lot running in

00:20:54,530 --> 00:21:01,910
zone 1 45 well if I flip over to

00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:04,010
accounts you'll also notice there's a

00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:06,050
lot of a council in this system as well

00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:09,620
we've got a lot of users on the system

00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:11,830
this is again you know a demo box that

00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:17,600
we use and we create a lot of them and

00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:20,150
quite frankly we don't clean it up we

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,880
don't have to so we don't but it makes

00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:26,180
for better demos too um so here's what

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,610
happens is now that you created a

00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:32,090
logical partitioning and dedicated that

00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:33,380
against the zone your next step is you

00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,380
got to do some kind of user account

00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:38,780
management here and so I've created an

00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:42,200
enterprise admin and made them the

00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:45,650
domain admin for my enterprise apps and

00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:48,410
then down here i have a cloud admin

00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:50,510
who's the domain admin of cloud apps and

00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:51,620
then I have some sub users under that as

00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:54,770
well

00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:57,830
because somebody has to be in charge of

00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:59,480
that zone and so this is now what now

00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,340
what we've done is we've created a

00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,960
logical partitioning we've assigned some

00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:05,420
resources to it now we've assigned some

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,670
users to it so now all we need to do is

00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,050
go in and actually run some instances

00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:11,360
against that which is what we're going

00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:13,990
to do next so I'm going to go ahead and

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,990
log out

00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:33,530
first thing you'll notice IM the

00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:36,920
enterprise admin the dashboard is very

00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:39,170
different this is not a big picture I'm

00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:42,290
worried about infrastructure kind of

00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:44,180
dashboard this is what instances are

00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:46,400
virtual machines am i running in my

00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,280
domain there's also not an

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:53,630
infrastructure button at the bottom I as

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:58,030
the zone administrator that's given to

00:22:53,630 --> 00:23:01,070
me I shouldn't have control over that so

00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:04,420
this this portal is actually designed

00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:08,120
specifically for me at my role and

00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:09,650
you'll notice if I go look I'm going to

00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:13,640
go back through that what I did before

00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:15,590
in the same order domains there's

00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,540
probably you know there's rude and cloud

00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:19,430
and all these oh it's still there but I

00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:21,710
don't have access to it anymore because

00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:24,320
I'm not supposed to so this is that the

00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:27,470
multi tendency aspects of it I only have

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:35,180
access to my production and development

00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:40,100
domains if I go look at accounts I only

00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:44,240
see the accounts within my zone as well

00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:46,820
and so but you can also again when we're

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,920
talking kind of dev versus prod versus

00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,870
everything kind of thing I've made some

00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:55,460
users and of course the admin there

00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:58,280
there at that top-level domain but I've

00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:03,050
got Fred here who is only assigned to

00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:05,990
dev can't touch production so a a sub

00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:08,810
isolation if you will of certain

00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:16,070
accounts only defined for certain

00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:19,340
purposes and lastly I go look at

00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:20,690
instances you remember that list that we

00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:25,820
kept scrolling kept scrolling kept

00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:27,290
scrolling I'm in zone 1 45 but these are

00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:30,320
all I see because these are the

00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:32,240
instances that are in my zone that I'm

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:37,400
specifically running that are assigned

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:39,539
to me as a tenant and if i go to add an

00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:43,159
instance

00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:48,200
just the drop down here there's no 137

00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:52,259
because of the dedication of the domains

00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:55,619
versus the zones I can't do anything in

00:24:52,259 --> 00:25:03,379
137 because that's not my zone I don't

00:24:55,619 --> 00:25:03,379
have permissions to do that um yes sir

00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:20,820
yes so you actually blew through all of

00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:22,619
the magic of this demo in one shot I'll

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,450
show edda normally I wouldn't show this

00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:26,999
but I'll show I'll show you actually

00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:31,309
it's a great question so what happens is

00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:33,419
we created this zone 145 was an original

00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:36,599
zone and it's almost like a top level

00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:38,369
one right and so first of all the

00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:41,009
question in case you don't didn't hear

00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:43,559
it and for the recording is can you like

00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:45,509
do it both ways kind of things and and

00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:47,639
so the answer is yes it all depends on

00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:50,039
where you are in the hierarchy if I

00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:52,080
actually log out here real quick as this

00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:55,080
guy so what happened is I'm going to

00:25:52,080 --> 00:26:00,059
talk while I'm doing it 145 when is was

00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:01,950
an existing zone and for some reasons we

00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:03,539
had in the lab it just didn't make sense

00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:05,159
to be able to dedicate the

00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:15,269
infrastructure exactly like we did so I

00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:19,470
dedicated 137 but if I go look sorry I

00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:21,379
can't type and talk at the same time if

00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:25,379
I go two instances under here at

00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:27,419
instance I can do it both it's a little

00:26:25,379 --> 00:26:31,109
hand waving we do in the demo but the

00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:36,599
reason why is because 137 is dedicated

00:26:31,109 --> 00:26:38,580
but 145 is actually wide open so you can

00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:41,070
do it as you can have multiple zones

00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,779
assigned to a set of resources without

00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,399
it out like we did here it's all based

00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:45,929
of that own that domain hierarchy and

00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:47,789
where you dedicate within the hierarchy

00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:49,109
so there is definitely amount of

00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:51,779
flexibility there it's just most people

00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:52,620
typically will do pinning of one versus

00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:56,490
the other

00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:59,700
so good question thank you um this is

00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:01,860
actually it for the demo um I just

00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:05,940
wanted to present the concepts there as

00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:08,370
I'm flipping back um what questions do

00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:27,240
you have before I wrap this up quickly

00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:33,179
any other questions okay yes sir yep the

00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:38,250
answer is it depends um but yes yes

00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:41,070
absolutely um most enterprises are doing

00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:44,520
it on our project based aspect do it

00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:46,200
this way actually some of the larger

00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,270
service providers that are running this

00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:52,260
they come up with their own custom Gilly

00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:53,670
and just make API calls against I have

00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,320
seen that as well and then another one I

00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,809
didn't go into it all is the concept of

00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:00,510
products Cuse me of projects there is

00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:03,300
also projects within it within the

00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:05,309
interface that you can actually create a

00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:08,100
project and assign a bunch of resources

00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:09,360
to it and then it lives for a certain

00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,830
amount of time and then you just kind of

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,740
destroyed the project and it is for

00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:16,890
exactly that project-based work you

00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:19,140
could do it for tendency in some ways of

00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:22,200
like here's a here's an organization or

00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:24,809
a group or but it's honestly designed

00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,190
more so to be transient of you create

00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:28,760
the project it lives for a certain

00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:30,780
amount of time and then it goes away

00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,610
exactly if it's more of a permanent

00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:35,190
thing that is going to happen over time

00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:41,850
zones or what are used that I've seen

00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:43,860
one of the questions cool um so with

00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:45,540
that I'll wrap this up very quickly if

00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,650
you want to kind of get started on this

00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:49,640
probably one of the biggest things I

00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:52,470
really enjoy about cloudstack is how

00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,250
quickly you can get going if you go out

00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:57,990
to Apache CloudStack there is devcloud

00:28:55,250 --> 00:29:00,600
devcloud is effectively a vm that you

00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:02,670
can run on your laptop to get a feel for

00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:05,830
all of this and play around with all of

00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:08,830
this so fantastic resource

00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:10,419
and of course the apache mailing lists

00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,500
if you want to start talking about this

00:29:10,419 --> 00:29:12,580
there's a users mailing list

00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,890
specifically out there if you want to

00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:17,669
ask questions about this there is a

00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:21,429
getting started doc section on the

00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:23,890
citric side of the house there is some

00:29:21,429 --> 00:29:27,159
specific guides written for for cloud

00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:28,870
platform as well if you want to just do

00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:31,659
something very quick and dirty there is

00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:35,350
a quick installation guide single

00:29:31,659 --> 00:29:38,529
management host non-production POC kind

00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:40,899
of thing want to build it in about a day

00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:43,090
I mean production quality there is the

00:29:40,899 --> 00:29:46,419
cloud platform installation guide and if

00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:48,190
you really want to go all out for those

00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:53,559
that are familiar with Cisco validated

00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:57,460
designs or CV DS this is a 450 ish page

00:29:53,559 --> 00:30:01,210
document of with Cisco UCS and Nexus

00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:03,809
gear and netapp on the back end for

00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:06,880
storage how can you create a flexpod

00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:12,370
environment based off of Citrix cloud

00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:14,860
platform very very kind of hardcore if

00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:17,139
you will document of how to build this

00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:18,820
entire thing with every single

00:30:17,139 --> 00:30:22,210
screenshot and variable you would ever

00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:24,610
want to put in the environment so with

00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:26,500
that thank you very much we did do the

00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:28,389
kind of the very high level cloud

00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:32,139
overview we went into the duel workloads

00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:35,889
and we did the demo so I will be around

00:30:32,139 --> 00:30:37,779
here for a while i'll be at the Citrix

00:30:35,889 --> 00:30:39,250
booth and SolidFire booth so if anybody

00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:42,539
has any questions certainly stop me

00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:42,539
