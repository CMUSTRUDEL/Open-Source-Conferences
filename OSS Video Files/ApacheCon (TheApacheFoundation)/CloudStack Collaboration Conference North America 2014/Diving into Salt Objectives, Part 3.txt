where were we running states you'll have

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,700
to tell me how you think this tutorial

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,179
is gone because I have kind of I

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,760
normally don't run this fast in these

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,650
tutorials and no matter how fast I run

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,170
we never get to pillar in these

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:26,580
tutorials I need to squeeze pillar in

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:28,260
its it's incredibly useful okay we

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,510
talked about environments we talked by

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,870
the top file we talked about time

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,100
compilation I briefly talked about

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,420
advanced targeting but this is all

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,550
documented and i glossed over targeting

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,469
a lot there's a lot more stuff you can

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,510
do with targeting I mean after you

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,989
install just do a salt dash age and

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:51,809
there's a section on targeting stuff in

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:57,420
in just the help output and just read

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:59,129
all those it's worth it one of my

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,300
favorite one of my favorite things that

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:02,460
I hear every now and then is somebody

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,129
come back and say that they said so i

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,950
sat down and the full salt documentation

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:11,909
that covers ninety-five percent of what

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:14,189
salt can do is roughly at this point

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:17,490
we're closing in on about 1,200 pages of

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:20,100
documentation and every now and then I

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:23,189
bump into somebody who says that they

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,100
just sat down and read it all and came

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,360
back and realized that then they came to

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,070
that realization that I've been talking

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,570
about already which is once you get to

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,670
know what it can do you start realizing

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,619
all the other problems that can solve

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,600
not just the ones that you wanted to

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:41,600
solve when you started all right tree

00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,600
