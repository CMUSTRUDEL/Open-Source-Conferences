yep so here's what we're going to do I'm

00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,720
going to spend just a minute give you a

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,940
couple of thoughts I've got about the

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,519
community and then hand off to Hugo the

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,070
next sucker and let him spend some time

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:20,090
with you whatever he wants to say I

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:23,850
don't know I've done so brio my select

00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:25,619
all right good deal so first some thanks

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,510
already did that didn't know I was gonna

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:31,019
emcee myself so I had to put that in

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:34,770
there let's talk about cloudstack

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,660
traction for a second we have an

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,020
enormous number of really satisfied

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,629
users this is a stat that we've used a

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,980
couple of times it's a little bit old

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:49,260
but in the first six months of getting

00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:51,030
into the apache software foundation we

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,789
measured the total number of unique IPS

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,820
that it downloaded the the CloudStack

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,170
packages from the repository that one of

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,320
our community members actually manages

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,730
so both rpms and deviance so 18,000 over

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,870
the course of six months now that was we

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,700
thought that was cool that's that's a

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,340
lot of small clouds and they'll probably

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,820
some very big ones being installed and

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:15,450
then during our last collaboration

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,710
conference in an Amsterdam we got to

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,240
looking at the logs just out of interest

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,720
and take took a look the last ten day

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,250
period and we saw 1,800 unique IPS

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,310
within a ten day period so that just

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:29,130
kind of showed some some pretty good

00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:30,600
growth and in reality what this means is

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,520
we've we've got lots of really small

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,310
cloudstack deployments out there there

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,829
are hundreds right citrix is a

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,930
distribution of Apache CloudStack right

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,210
so their commercial product is is based

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,729
on us we know that they're they're

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,159
claiming about 300 I don't know what's a

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:49,259
specific number is but I also know that

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,049
we did a user survey while back and

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,670
simply by observing the user list we've

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:58,380
we're seeing providers pop up all over

00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:00,960
the globe in Nigeria there's a

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,600
cloudstack provider you know we see them

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,240
all over South America at this point

00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:09,959
obviously you know Japan is wildly

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,330
interested in cloudstack china china is

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,150
going extremely well for another

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,939
district

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:18,189
of Apache CloudStack that I believe

00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:19,930
trend micro trend micro does so they're

00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:21,819
they're just going like gangbusters in

00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,590
China right now so the software that we

00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:25,750
produces a community or that you use as

00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,159
a as a member of our community really is

00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:31,120
making a very very large impact on IT

00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:33,069
services so we've got a fantastic dev

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,599
community we are one of the most active

00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,849
projects at the asf in terms of total

00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:39,609
number of active contributors and

00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:41,379
commits right this is something that you

00:02:39,609 --> 00:02:42,400
know good bad or otherwise it's not like

00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:46,180
we're trying to compare ourselves with

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,540
other projects as much as to say that we

00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:54,280
are a very active healthy development

00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:56,920
organization and that's fantastic where

00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,720
we go you can look at all the code we've

00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,159
got and how that into a monetary value

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,230
lots of different systems for that

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,090
depends no depends what system you use

00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,859
but the result is we've actually created

00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,230
something that the intellectual property

00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:10,629
value itself is in a millions right the

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:13,659
economic impact is at this point

00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:16,060
probably approaching billions right so

00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:17,769
we really are making a big impact there

00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:22,329
and we are attracting more and more

00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:23,440
developers I at this point don't forget

00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:25,629
to spend quite as much time in the

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,720
development list as I would like given

00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:30,190
day job responsibilities but every time

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,690
I pop in there it seems like there are

00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,120
new faces that are actively engaged

00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,739
already and that's great and that's a

00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,019
testament to both how welcoming all of

00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:40,569
the the engineers are that that work on

00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:42,099
the project today or you know do that

00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:44,739
for their day job it's also a testament

00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:47,019
to how welcoming the user community

00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:49,720
that's that's embedded in you know the

00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:53,109
mailing lists is so it's all real

00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,750
positive stuff so sometimes users can be

00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:58,030
loud I wish all of our users were loud

00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:01,209
but sometimes users can be loud the

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,859
there are global user groups and you

00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:05,079
know I would be remiss not to really

00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:08,139
point out two specific ones i think that

00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,790
the european user group is doing amazing

00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:11,919
work across multiple countries and i

00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,479
think that the japan user group is doing

00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,129
amazing work I actually just got back

00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:17,769
from Japan there was an event there

00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:22,150
about a month ago it was cloudstack date

00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:26,320
Japan and there were 500 attendees to

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:27,120
that event amazing traction there a lot

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,100
of

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,830
not just you know individual interest

00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,350
but corporate interest there's a lot of

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:38,130
Commerce going on around or project in

00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:41,250
Japan users are helping users as well

00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:44,639
this is something that I love about the

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:46,620
cloud sac community if you haven't spent

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,139
time on the user list if you don't

00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,389
actively read it or you're not

00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:54,780
subscribed even just go take a look at

00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:56,550
the archives it astounds me the number

00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,300
of users that are willing to help other

00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:01,350
operators of CloudStack deal with a bug

00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,949
work around a particular configuration

00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:06,240
problem troubleshoot an issue that may

00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:07,650
have nothing to do with CloudStack it

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,350
could be a hypervisor issue it could be

00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:12,780
a network stack issue it's we really

00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,750
have formed an incredible community of

00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:21,770
users and we need to do much much much

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,770
more of this the the platte sec PMC is

00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:29,010
working to try to help more users be

00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:30,539
louder about the project we just started

00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,310
some discussions on this topic and you

00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:36,479
can't expect to hear more from us as

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:38,669
time goes on so what did I learn one

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:42,090
year acting is the the chair of the PMC

00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:43,530
this community is fantastic and I really

00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,919
would not have traded the last year for

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:51,500
for anything so with that I'm going to

00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:51,500
introduce the next sucker Hugo

00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,470
so before we get started I would like to

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,280
take this opportunity to thank chip

00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:11,420
first awesome work I mean the VP it's a

00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,310
role that some people think it's a

00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,440
sucker role some people think it's

00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:18,170
actually important likely i'm not one of

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,760
those but i think chip was the first vp

00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,740
we had for apache class they sent to her

00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,970
top level project so that means that he

00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,560
didn't only fulfill the role they

00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:27,410
actually set the standard about how this

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,570
role should have been done and i think

00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:36,470
he did a really awesome job so thank you

00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:38,720
thank you so much thanks for he's a

00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:49,310
jolly good fellow for he's a jolly good

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:51,680
fellow how that all about okay so yeah

00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:56,180
as chip introducing I'm the next sucker

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,860
I'm the guy doing your pmc chair I'm the

00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:02,390
guy being the vice president for the

00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:04,760
Apache CloudStack project but yeah it's

00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:07,640
not about me it's about you guys it's

00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:10,100
about it's about community so we're here

00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,140
today there's 371 people who signed up

00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,120
for the class tech collaboration

00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:17,240
conference that's a pretty huge number

00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:20,090
and actually chip already mentioned a

00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,260
lot of numbers already but yeah most of

00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:24,770
you know there's three kinds of lies

00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:26,480
lies damn lies and statistics so I'm

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,430
going to be talking a little bit about

00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,930
about a lot of numbers I spent the last

00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,030
couple of days when I was preparing this

00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,350
presentation looking at all kinds of all

00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:36,830
kinds of figures about the classic

00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:38,120
community and what it's all about for

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,330
example in this conference we have over

00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:44,120
40 hours of talks ready for you over the

00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:46,100
next two days that's a lot of content

00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:50,690
that's a lot of people willing to share

00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:54,250
ideas dreams practical things about

00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:57,950
cloudstack ranging from developer talks

00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:00,710
user content and of course talks by our

00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,210
amazing sponsors who are going to

00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:07,100
explain to you how their products work

00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:09,110
within the class tech ecosystem the

00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:11,450
people that are here their users their

00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,520
developers understanding a lot of emails

00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,660
there's on average two thousand messages

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,690
per day

00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:22,970
on a developer mailing list a month a

00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:24,440
month sorry Sebastian and another

00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,960
several hundred per month on the user

00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,150
menu list what does that actually say

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,770
about our community what does it mean

00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,630
doesn't mean that we are a viable

00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,970
community that we're doing a good job no

00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:36,860
it's just it just a random number for me

00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,950
what's important is the amount of

00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,180
content that's actually automating this

00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,289
2000 messengers in itself isn't saying

00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,729
anything but if you look through the

00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,380
messages and you look through what

00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:47,000
people are actually posting there's

00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,740
people are really thinking about clastic

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,480
they're thinking about how to take this

00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,850
project forward how to use the project

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,580
and like chips header there are there

00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:57,380
helping people with CloudStack so a

00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,300
project is very much it's very much

00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,500
alive and it's going places and you can

00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,760
see that by the people who are

00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,770
interested on the community about

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:11,690
sharing their ideas and what they're

00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:14,690
doing with our with our software this is

00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:18,250
probably not running club sec package is

00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:20,090
downloaded to over 110 countries I

00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,350
didn't look it up how many countries

00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:24,500
should actually have in the world but I

00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:28,960
think we have a pretty huge chunk that's

00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:31,850
a pretty far-reaching effect for a

00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,610
project that's actually one of the

00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,900
best-kept secrets worldwide I mean if

00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,600
you look at the amount of people who

00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:41,990
said yeah we run a cloudstack instance

00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,540
there was a survey done we have 300 over

00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:47,290
300 known installations if we have ten

00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:50,240
hundred and ten downloads and not act or

00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:53,570
110 countries that download why do we

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,010
only have 300 installations why aren't

00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,980
more people standing up saying hey we're

00:09:55,010 --> 00:10:00,800
using cloudstack the numbers just don't

00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:03,830
add up there's got to be more we need to

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,200
be more vocal more active about rare

00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,700
classic is going and that we are we are

00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,290
the best kept secret but we don't want

00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,290
to be a secret no longer we want to be

00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:14,060
detailed project in clouds we want to be

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,950
the guys who make sure that class work

00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,200
and there's work to be done for every of

00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:20,480
us there's work to be on the marketing

00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,160
there's work to be done in outreach but

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,380
there's also work to be done in code

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,450
expanding new features adding new things

00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,250
that we can orchestrate and making sure

00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:32,000
that our code is usable and stay

00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:35,270
for the next generation of users so to

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,610
do that we have we have committees we

00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:39,610
have PMC members at the moment we are 74

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,630
committers and the interesting thing is

00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:44,570
committers aren't only the people who

00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:46,010
write an actual code our committers are

00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:49,910
doing so much more it's a much broader

00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:52,070
community it's people who do marketing

00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:54,170
events it's people who focus on how to

00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:55,700
do outreach with CloudStack there's also

00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:59,150
coders in there and they're pretty

00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:00,770
important but there's more to being a

00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:03,020
committer than just writing code it's

00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:05,410
about helping the project along there's

00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:08,450
26 people in the PMC at the moment

00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:10,940
they're people helping thinking about

00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:13,040
more than code or marketing outreach

00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:16,240
they're thinking about legal issues that

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:19,250
thinking about other issues but actually

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,310
what's more important is that those

00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:24,440
people actually help the project guided

00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:28,430
in such a way that we can have a lot of

00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,230
active participation and we do have we

00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:33,710
do have a lot of active participation we

00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:36,140
have 280 commits in the last 30 days in

00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:37,790
itself it's just a random number but if

00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:41,170
you look what is what's in those commits

00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:44,420
it's going to be features it's bug fixes

00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:47,510
its people working on our code base and

00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:50,240
making sure it improves it can do more

00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:53,750
and it can work harder and of those

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,250
commits there's 52 contributors 52

00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,530
contributors and only a small fraction

00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,420
of them are actually people who are

00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:01,130
currently a committer so that means that

00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:03,320
there's a lot of people outside of the

00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,790
community or inside of the community but

00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,160
outside of the committee group that are

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,830
donating code there's people there who

00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,390
have a day return regularly and they do

00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:13,580
more commits but it's also a lot a lot

00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:16,700
of people there who just basely

00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,410
passers-by they come in commit a bit of

00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,620
code commit something that they find

00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:24,500
interesting or from to fix the bug and

00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:28,880
move on again and we see it we see it

00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:30,830
picking up there's so much more people

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,350
coming in into the project nowadays it's

00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,390
it's staggering if you look at óleo the

00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,790
graphs they have about our participation

00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:40,550
about the contributors we have it's it's

00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,750
almost again it's exploding it's very

00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:45,710
very hard

00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:47,600
on the other side the fun part is we get

00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:49,670
a lot more committees we get a lot more

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,250
contributors on the code and the actual

00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:54,140
amount of change code is going down and

00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,400
I find a very interesting because I

00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,130
think that's a very important point

00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,720
because it means that we're not just

00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:01,610
randomly adding a lot of stuff to class

00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,760
I've ever actually thinking about what

00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:06,710
we're doing so in the moment in

00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:10,280
CloudStack we have over one and a half

00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:12,860
million lines of code that's a lot

00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,560
that's a big project over seventy

00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,270
percent of that code is java code and

00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,700
the others are different languages we

00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:22,340
have C sharp in there we have Biden in

00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:24,020
there we have a lot in there if you look

00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:27,940
at the code and some random statistics

00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:31,010
that are made by Coverity in this case

00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:37,070
we have six point 44 defects per

00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:39,580
thousand lines of code that's it might

00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:42,350
be bad might be good I don't know but

00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:45,110
what's important here is that with all

00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,760
those contributors with all those people

00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:49,520
that are working on there's a lot of

00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,930
work to be done we're 6.42 4d for

00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,960
expertise and lines of code means if we

00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:55,430
have a lot of defects but if you have so

00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,770
much defects what are we doing here why

00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:59,150
is everybody here shouting the lungs out

00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,520
that this CloudStack is actually a

00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:04,190
fantastic product again one of those

00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,560
numbers that's basically a lie we have a

00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,330
very stable and very high quality code

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,710
base and we keep on continuing to

00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:15,050
improve it we have our Jenkins's our

00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:21,830
automated building CI system running 95

00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:27,170
jobs executing over twelve twelve

00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:29,089
hundred unit tests every commit and 121

00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,890
functional tests and for me the

00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:33,380
functional tests are actually the most

00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:35,540
important even though there's we can

00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:38,360
have some statistics about quality of

00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:40,580
the code and about where the how to code

00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,520
the structures etc but in the end this

00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:45,200
is what matters the functional tests

00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,480
that we have and the people who are

00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,930
using it and feeding us feeding us bugs

00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:53,450
feeding us information about how they're

00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,400
using it they decide if the product is

00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:57,920
is of a good quality

00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,960
there are people that matter I don't

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,240
care about statistics on on bug

00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,520
statistics of light statistics on

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,020
complexity for me the important part is

00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,390
that we have a usable products and

00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:11,090
people are trusting this product to do

00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:14,570
their business on that they trusted to

00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:16,640
run what ya to run their business or

00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:21,770
that there's people out there who trust

00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:26,120
us to run that basically to be a project

00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:28,160
they can rely on for their own future so

00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,740
in the end for me there's only one

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,410
important number and that's that we are

00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:36,050
one community and it is my distinct

00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,480
pleasure tonight to serve you as your

00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:41,750
new VP of CloudStack and yeah whatever

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,950
it is I can do for you guys I'm here let

00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,950
