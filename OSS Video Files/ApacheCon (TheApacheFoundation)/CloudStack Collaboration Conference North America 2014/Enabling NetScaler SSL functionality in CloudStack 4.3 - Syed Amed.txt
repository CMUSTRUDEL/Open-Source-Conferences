okay so what I want to talk today is how

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,389
to use SSL offloading or ethical

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,950
termination on net killer using

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,380
cloudstack so right now this

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,590
functionality is still in the API so you

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:20,250
will not be able to use it via the UI

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:22,470
but I have code ready for kind of like

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,800
there are some discussions around where

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,660
exactly in the UI this should go and

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,390
probably I will be be adding it done

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:34,230
sometime soon so when we start looking

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:37,739
at the UI or sorry the functionalities

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:41,460
which are are in the ssl offloading

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:45,270
module so we do a certificate validation

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,489
certificate we support certificate trust

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,489
chains that means basically you have so

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:54,510
how many of you guys are aware with ssl

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:57,239
and ssl trust chains right everyone okay

00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:00,210
cool so we support encrypt so what are

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:03,840
this module supports encrypted ssl

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:08,100
luckys certificate chain since

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,830
self-signed search yeah a lot of things

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,420
but the requirement here is that all

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:17,600
your keys are in dot Pam or Pam format

00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:23,610
which is busy most of the people right

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:25,530
indeeds days you spam okay so and also

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:30,150
yeah this is only supported in the

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:34,170
netscaler so these are the api's which

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:37,799
are which you need to create an SSL rule

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,270
and add it to I mean and make it work so

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:45,000
the first thing you know you need to do

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:48,149
is to create a load balancer so right

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,939
now you there is a new parameter that I

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:54,680
have added lb underscore protocol which

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:54,680
