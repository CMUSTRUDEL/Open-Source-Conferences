The Apache PLC4X project left the incubator last year and is one of the younger projets of the ASF. It is a set of libraries for communicating with industrial programmable logic controllers (PLCs) using a variety of protocols but with a shared API. At pragmatic minds we had the first (known) productive deployments of PLC4X in industrial projects. As many may know, there still is a gap between the very IT affine Open Source world and the OT or shop floor world in the industry. So, at the beginning, these projects sometimes felt like Alices adventures when she fell down the rabbit hole. During these projects we entered a world that is completely different, sometimes strange but very exciting.

Julian Feinauer studied mathematics at the university of Stuttgart and received his PhD in mathematics at Ulm University. Besides his interest in open source and big data he had many contacts with timeseries data, storage and evaluation. In 2016 he founded the company pragmatic industries GmbH with focus on industrial iot and industry data processing.
