Location: Emporium Logan Square Arcade Bar
Machine learning applications are typically stitched together from hopes and dreams, shell scripts, cron jobs, home-grown schedulers, snippets of configuration clipped from multiple blog posts, thousands of hard-coded business rules, a.k.a. "our SQL corpus," and a few lines of training and testing code. Organizing all the moving parts into something maintainable and supportive of ongoing development is a challenge most teams have on their TODO list, roadmap, or tech debt pile. Getting ahead of the day-to-day demands and settling into a sane architecture often seems like an unattainable goal. The past several years have seen an explosion of tool-building in the data engineering and analytics area, including in Apache projects spanning the areas of search and information retrieval, job orchestration, file and stream formats, and machine learning libraries. In this talk we will cover our product and development teams' choices of architecture and tools, from data ingestion and storage, through transformations and processing, to presentation of results and publishing to web services, reports, and applications.

A Technical (How To) presented as Regular Talk in the Startups track.

	00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:59,940
Comanche group does machine learning

00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:02,399
development so there's a lot of tools

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:06,439
the last five to ten years of seniors an

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:10,290
explosion of building platform building

00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:12,960
things to enable your teams and this is

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,720
just a laundry list I picked out of out

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,530
of a hat you know in thirty seconds of

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,360
just machine learning tools and then you

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,670
can get into vendor solutions you can

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,700
get into which tend to be kitchen sink

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,829
things like in the end we can do

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,259
everything you need whether it's a holy

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:32,820
teacher fishing learning application or

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,350
whether it's let your deficit just get

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:49,979
down in the right signal queries or

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:52,140
write code or the so that's a lot of

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:53,730
things to take in a lot of teams have

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,060
different preferences everybody

00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:58,320
their own preferences so the challenge

00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,790
for a lot of machine learning teams is

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,040
how many choose the right tools how do

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,190
you get them but add to see everybody

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,460
happy to jump answer that as a secondary

00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:09,840
of them but that's just machine learning

00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,670
pieces because to build with she

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,710
learning products you need a lot be able

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,360
to bring your data in need to be able to

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,700
do feature extraction and feature

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,530
engineering we do quantum results follow

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,120
your work you can see how you're doing

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,240
you need to present the results to your

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,040
stakeholders new customers you need to

00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,630
have some kind of place to to deploy

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,430
your results whether it's a reporter to

00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,390
get email out whether it's a website

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:35,370
whether ables a dashboard it's on and

00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:37,890
then along with that as well there are

00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,380
other pieces that can important inform

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,520
what you're doing machine learning

00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,770
practitioner you could have a search

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:48,360
search index that you use at the back

00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:50,730
end for your machine learning amendments

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,460
he really need to be able to manage of

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:57,360
models you look at decorations every

00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:59,610
time you track your data personally you

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,760
have as you're reviewing your work you

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,380
don't have 50 different versions of the

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:09,200
same script with different parameters

00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:12,060
and you must track which data I think

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:18,480
and then we'll also need monitoring for

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:20,300
your application customer behavior or

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,850
whether it's the model degrade over time

00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:26,670
so that's a lot of moving parts I'll do

00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:29,010
this we just want to get a little

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,540
predict I'm gonna get a little bit like

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,209
given an input

00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:36,150
predict an answer and I'm not down

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:39,000
enough down playing linear regression a

00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,890
bunch of really if you're doing one of

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,250
the most it's day out of production your

00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,600
head mostly and I you know a lot of

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,970
times that's the right answer that's the

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,950
right thing to be doing and for the sake

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,709
of this talk if you're getting the

00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,750
linear

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:56,430
that scale production that's that's

00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,430
that's your mom

00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:02,200
so just about me and why I'm here well

00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,760
first of all trevor is on the TMC of a

00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,640
bunch of the group and the chair and so

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,959
I wanted to see him this is how we see

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,049
each other work on these projects

00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,180
together television says chief data

00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:20,380
scientist for Accenture senior director

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:22,389
of advising services to go with Apache I

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:26,680
started by fixing a bug in poop that I

00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:33,220
use a customer grunting now to buy I'll

00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:35,889
fix it up with release I also do believe

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,780
in bringing people into open source

00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:39,759
internet companies so I've started a

00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:45,669
project programmatic temperature lens

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:48,250
there where we into the nature of

00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:50,979
urbanization contributions actually

00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:53,590
sounds a lot better in the practice

00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:56,310
because almost nobody has time

00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,310
reclamation

00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,769
[Music]

00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:19,270
then you get into the fun part lines of

00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:23,790
code life slip training and then test we

00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,790
go through them

00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:43,379
you may have a beautiful model and your

00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:45,150
organization it may be a simple sequel

00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:50,699
very visible if they have operationally

00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:52,289
out that we will want to build the Lord

00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,490
lesson here is that there is no assembly

00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:55,590
line the first few times you do

00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,750
something like this it's up to you as

00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:01,969
you do it as your organization does this

00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,969
to learn from your mistakes and to make

00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,349
this that sounded like a little bird

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,870
tells a lot of impediments and it's

00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:14,939
actually not even the happen because

00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:17,699
before you even get to there's a lot of

00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:32,250
possible tip to be especially if an idea

00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:39,270
has to be good as to or even the time

00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:40,919
that you spend you may be buried they

00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:45,629
need to do all the constants so very

00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:47,699
hard I University get through situations

00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:52,400
where I'm a to see too many

00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:54,750
project to 3d CEOs in a row one

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,940
recruited another became in to replace

00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,940
him and then came back

00:08:01,590 --> 00:09:46,630
if success especially if you can build

00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:51,910
innovative to measure the monetary value

00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:54,699
really that's you could go anything no

00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:55,750
you know maybe testing it's the same we

00:09:54,699 --> 00:10:01,889
have the photometer

00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:31,329
make sure that our recommender results

00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:33,279
or and even though there are all these

00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:38,139
troubles of practitioners know these

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:40,389
prevalent if they're aware it's a high

00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:51,970
priority for Louisville at least now to

00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:53,500
put machine learning you will enemies in

00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:55,350
the market we're beating you eating your

00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,819
lunch because they have an end of story

00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:01,019
can be part of the reality if you must

00:10:57,819 --> 00:11:03,850
be part of district marketing yourself

00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:07,449
so a lot of companies both big have to

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:09,699
have that on the materials when they go

00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:12,339
to show customers just at the end to

00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:14,649
staff table states and if they don't

00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:18,339
have a mentor to learning in their deck

00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:24,250
that's in their view it can be positive

00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:28,329
reality then so you have a few levels of

00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:30,670
service it's not bad not a bad idea it's

00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:33,339
not bad judgment necessarily but it's a

00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:37,810
reason why things can fail later you

00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:40,480
have a very high three many from the

00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:42,519
leadership to do an amount and a generic

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,100
level that's a suit about going silent

00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:48,480
it could be a very bad problem because

00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,480
what you might have a lot of

00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,019
[Music]

00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,559
[Applause]

00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,600
[Music]

00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:04,279
well having incorrect assumptions about

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:08,420
people do believe and I have heard

00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:10,910
things like this machine learning accept

00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:13,310
the data that you give it and machine

00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:15,740
learning and then answer you what your

00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:17,329
KPIX would be so what we should've ended

00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:20,709
you know that's that's pretty

00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,709
aspirational on I think that's

00:13:29,230 --> 00:14:58,240
it's because they

00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:41,360
to research so I am I am buying sources

00:15:41,690 --> 00:16:20,480
that's all it's HDFS save a lot of money

00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,480
wait

00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:47,520
[Music]

00:16:55,449 --> 00:17:06,079
two-week period before spring and it was

00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:08,179
great you can use JSP custom tags is

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,370
wonderful and you can get your web

00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:15,470
developers know they can work with it

00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:23,799
have things flat on it again there was

00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:38,360
no any stack traces Stack Overflow or

00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:51,669
Google+ this time it was so moving on

00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:54,080
stuff to the vendor demonstrated a month

00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:57,980
but then you talk about competing they

00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:00,669
say that you can't do this and that

00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:03,590
stuff happens like non-stop anytime

00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:08,210
anytime you credit you can have just

00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:10,960
steel barriers from you don't expect it

00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,960
you're gonna

00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,700
[Music]

00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:38,840
you have

00:20:16,200 --> 00:21:10,389
you want to have something a little more

00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:12,879
people so this is the conceptual view of

00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:15,539
what we're talking about you can

00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:17,739
separate these things out and you can

00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:20,759
compartmentalize what kinds of skills

00:21:17,739 --> 00:21:26,099
you need to develop an egregore for each

00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:26,099
work on the range do we have next

00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:30,020
[Music]

00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,179

00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,670
[Music]

00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:12,239
as long as you're willing to the

00:24:08,129 --> 00:24:20,820
standards where each stage the other way

00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:25,080
you don't have to and your policy as to

00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:31,859
reconcile when this you know this little

00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:35,090
ground is acute you know I think the

00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:35,090
concept here is it's

00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:49,349
[Music]

00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,789

00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,700
[Music]

00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:06,190
we basically bring out of two one two

00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:06,190
three four is the UI for

00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:06,450
[Music]

00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:25,230

00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,660
[Music]

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:29,790
love it's beautiful awesome it works and

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,520
