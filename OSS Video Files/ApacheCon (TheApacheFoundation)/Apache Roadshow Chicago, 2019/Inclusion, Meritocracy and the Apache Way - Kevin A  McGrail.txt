okay I'm gonna go around the shield is

00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:23,189
solution meritocracy in the Apache wait

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,710
and I'd like to talk about the positives

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,900
of it and how you can use it for your

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,369
advantage to really improve by your

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,800
communities to improve that people to

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,320
bring into this so a little bit about

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,570
being not too much I worked on the

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,149
Apaches spamassassin project I've been

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,120
involved there for a long time I served

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:46,620
as a PD about fundraising and executive

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,870
officer the treasurer role as well

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,120
and today we're going to talk about what

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,090
is the SF what is the impact weighing

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,210
our inclusion and how that works these

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,820
major topics I knew a lot of ways I

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,890
could talk like it when you call it's a

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,530
very very fast person in New York I

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,110
think so one of the things about me that

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,909
I try and make sure with my inclusion in

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,100
my work a lot of that I can stuff that

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,229
stood on the work for an organization I

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,509
have which is this disorder you don't

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,970
probably believe is certainly 49 people

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,640
the world including you to have it

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,860
but because that I did try and think

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,049
about what people are going through what

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,020
struggles they have what makes their

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:31,369
life difficult in working on you know

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,710
open source long so alright what is this

00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:37,049
most people know what it is here but you

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,630
know we're charity or 501c3 in the US

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:42,630
and we're not a trade organization and

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:45,060
we really started out our project was

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,310
the needs to be server and you know

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,960
imagine software license those are

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,899
people kind of think synonymously the

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,060
compassionate notes to do items but our

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,180
mission is to provide software for the

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,369
public good we basically do that by

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,640
providing the structure and the legal

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:04,799
foundation for profits to come in and be

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,149
able to produce their software and we do

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,069
a lot of them and we release the

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,760
software at no charge it's very very

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:12,810
important to do I won't talk too much

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,819
about the license

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,620
very permissive very business friendly

00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:19,730
and it's one of the reasons I started

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:22,319
supporting the ESF still growing long

00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,970
this is a great slide you want to talk

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,430
to people about the Apache Software

00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,620
Foundation that's in your community or

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,790
increasing diversity if they didn't

00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,440
murder the Apache Software Foundation

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,630
these are three bullet points I'd like

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,640
to bring up that impede some of the

00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,860
world's websites use some portion of our

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,170
software every smartphone in the world

00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,970
peddle our software on and every plane

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,580
in US airspace is tracking our sauce

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,530
those are pretty big things but you talk

00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,050
about people who are they're so into

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,180
prison and how things work that people

00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,830
don't know we are so many people excited

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,350
into the kind of statistics that we've

00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,450
been tell about I also really like these

00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,190
two websites front headstone Apache

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,920
Network and punching I ordered slash

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,780
logos some of the latter one has

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,180
everything go for all of our top level

00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,630
projects I think we've almost got about

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,730
two dozen of incubating projects as well

00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,739
so it looks are really really good and

00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:15,510
on there you can see all the problems we

00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:18,840
have so we're at greater need to open

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,370
source projects or initiatives there are

00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,400
two hundred two committees three and

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:27,090
thirty two products I think over fifty

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,560
fifty exactly those are the new projects

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,829
that may or may not make it to the top

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,410
level that's a lot of initiatives a lot

00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:36,090
of things to keep track though I will

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,680
get all of them but there's a lot we go

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,380
from A to Z

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:46,350
serve sees even but we even have Apaches

00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:48,840
who key purpose so really what I do the

00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:51,200
quiz and I know these rich you're not

00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:56,209
answer this question

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,209
Ruby or knows why the do this ecology

00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:08,400
you want to go in yeah exactly

00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:11,160
elephants was one of his kids and

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,220
biggest son younger sons stuffed animal

00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,919
a dude this is how engineers beings

00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,769
usually some sort of silly thing like

00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:22,310
that stuff animal Lords a reference in

00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,889
some pop culture movie or

00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,000
playing MapReduce so you know these kind

00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,620
of things you know they're playful

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,050
they're they show that there's people

00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,669
behind these things you recommend you do

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,200
you think about where these things come

00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:33,919
from

00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,870
additionally one of the ones I like

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,389
telling people that you know again

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:41,600
engineers love double entendre those

00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:44,450
double meetings and furthermore so big

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,100
data the term big data most people

00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,470
assume that has to do with the size of

00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,270
the data it sort of does but that's not

00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,040
really it had to do in fact that Doug

00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:54,710
was talking about elephants elephants

00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,900
live mr. bisson circuses were our big

00:04:54,710 --> 00:05:03,410
time so that's kind of where wing talk

00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:05,540
God's name installation so a lot of

00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,430
reasons that stuff exists that I think

00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,320
the previous speakers were dead on in

00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,060
this tribal knowledge it's the guy

00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,160
trying it out there's a neat stories

00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,560
they talk about why these things exist

00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,380
and they a lot of times to give you

00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,780
insight into why things work because

00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:24,080
we're 20 years old now we're getting to

00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:26,300
be pretty great parents here and we'll

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,229
be the next generation of thinking up

00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,700
and take it to where they want to go

00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:34,720
okay so this is a really important thing

00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:37,370
about being a sound because we don't

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,140
really believe we have to be under

00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,330
percent conclusive because it's a matter

00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:45,710
of core we're not gonna proceed with

00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:47,870
calculus or meritocracy and what that

00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:50,810
means is you have to be able to kind of

00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:53,090
back up what you say right to it and

00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,350
earn merit and you can hurt Mary and a

00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:58,280
lot of different ways that's something

00:05:54,350 --> 00:06:01,010
I'm very documentation graphics but

00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,979
grooming answering questions on user

00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:06,830
lists and things like that putting on

00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:09,260
road shows these are waging hurt America

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,030
aren't just coding sometimes you people

00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:13,460
that are a little too coding it's the

00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:16,280
only we even turn that's not correct but

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,139
the point is is that meritocracy is

00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,639
really a key part but it's the good

00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:21,560
parts not marathons if you read about a

00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:23,810
meritocracy people will talk about in

00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,500
fact that's a really bad one throw them

00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:29,479
out bad stuff you don't make any slogans

00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:32,210
like talk a little bit about why they

00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:33,689
exist what we provide we provide the

00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:37,499
resources you

00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:39,059
provide legal protection recognitions a

00:06:37,499 --> 00:06:40,709
lot of marketing and stuff like that to

00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:43,289
help people hear scales from cannot grow

00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:45,749
your evenings big phrase we make a lot

00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:47,699
of sister beers out front communities

00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:50,729
over code very important building

00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:55,879
community software as a lifetime it will

00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:55,879
go away that's a natural part of it does

00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:54,050
all right so here is this one right here

00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:11,849
what we spent Boston trying our

00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,689
keyboards doing anyway okay so long in

00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:16,409
the Apache way

00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:18,389
so the Apache way is very received I'd

00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:20,189
like to make two points and sometimes

00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:22,469
people don't like my first point which

00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:25,019
is that a lot of people being Apache

00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:27,899
waiting for three years but the reason I

00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:30,629
mentioned that is I know that they might

00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:36,889
be because sometimes it feels like it's

00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:39,240
it's undefined it feels like it is is

00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:42,209
tampering what they're doing but then

00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,670
usually about two years then something

00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:46,440
comes up and they see a line and that's

00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,360
all a general intelligence

00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,959
that stick with it they'll be a

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:54,720
reasonable lichen and one of the big

00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:56,190
reasons I like it is because it is not

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,440
necessarily tribal acknowledgement a lot

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,740
of us we do talks about it but it's

00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,199
there is no wanna patchy way so dating

00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,779
Ruggeri we actually formed the term yet

00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:08,819
another the attaching made presentation

00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:10,769
so that's kind of what this is yet

00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:17,370
another one and everybody has to

00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:19,709
motivate a lot of what Danny Angus wrote

00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,269
this book basically what he said is one

00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:23,430
of the reasons he likes it is because of

00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,959
the Sicilian and it's self directed you

00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,149
know over 20 years ago to help we

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:31,439
started doing this open source to eat

00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:36,990
Donnie was also named in February this

00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:40,050
morning meeting America they got formed

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,879
but the point being is it's not like

00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,009
anybody gave us a book on how to do it

00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:46,079
or roadmap or how to kind of make this

00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:48,029
happen so we had to make it up as we

00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:50,759
went along and that that sounds a limb

00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:51,329
form but we had to basically correct as

00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:53,040
we go along

00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:54,990
and figure out what charts the path I

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,170
think right now we're in a similar

00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:59,699
situation where diversity and inclusion

00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:01,319
meritocracy needs to be charted for

00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,839
what's going to be the successful way

00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:06,509
over the next 20 years

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,680
so when we are charity and that is

00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:11,160
probably one of the biggest points

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,860
review to develop good communities are

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,779
code big big point one of the things we

00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:19,259
try and do to try and support minority

00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:22,199
voices and build support rather than do

00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:24,269
so you know sometimes it's problematic

00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:26,490
we've been talking about it today for

00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:28,980
the court but you know we don't want to

00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:30,930
force decisions down people's rows on

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,600
here there we want to hear why there's

00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:36,870
things they say and II think I've been

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,309
married that to make that happen

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,529
so it's a very important thing about our

00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:42,089
communities additionally we have some

00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:45,089
really crazy voting things you'll see

00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:46,860
this go into other points of our life so

00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:48,779
plus one means you agree with something

00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,399
zero means you're like man I don't know

00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:52,110
if I agree or disagree with it and

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,019
negative one is that you know I strongly

00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,970
disagree with this so we run a lot of

00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,770
ways quite lazy consensus which kind of

00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,300
means like

00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,860
hey on Friday I'm going to do this

00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,260
unless anybody stands up and says

00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:05,450
they're not magnets sometimes become

00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,400
certain other windows and rules where we

00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:10,130
try and build consensus but we don't

00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,630
necessarily have to have we agree and

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,670
there's a relief there's a great website

00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,020
on our muting procedures on how we do

00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,060
this on our website so you see people

00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,500
say like you know it's kind of a Google

00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,300
application you go up eat supper dinner

00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,130
on Friday you get a little bunch of Plus

00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,900
Ones and then some beautiful e- blonde

00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:26,270
and then the conversation will start

00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,460
about my itza slots to bite for example

00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:32,590
chicago pizza is not eat sets casserole

00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:35,840
them on these are very important debates

00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:38,210
but initially meritocracy this is Connor

00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,520
is earned through merit and I chose the

00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:43,640
word power on purpose because it is a

00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:46,250
way of amassing power you do what you

00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:48,320
say you're going to do and the JFDI

00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:51,050
offense will is the gym just let them do

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,190
it so you know Trevor for example was

00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:54,230
like I don't want to throw an event in

00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:56,720
Chicago and he just started doing and he

00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,730
led and if you should meet by example

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,360
it's the way to get a lot of things done

00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:04,400
and underneath parking people who have

00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,260
ideas and are willing to back those

00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,120
ideas up those are the ones that are in

00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,500
there of the fastest and that's one of

00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,020
the things I'll talk about a little bit

00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,510
you could each apart is how are you

00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:16,520
gonna earn merit fastest because that is

00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:18,560
the best way to become a part of the

00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:21,230
community and how to get over any

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,330
hurdles that you can add the start of

00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,950
doing that documentation helps all these

00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:27,200
other things but there's other ways as

00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:29,450
well but one of the key things is

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,550
everybody at the ASF is individuals

00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:33,500
nobody represents a company you don't

00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,270
have to mention really work it really

00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,490
isn't relevant I don't even care

00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:39,830
there are some times when I know but

00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:42,050
other than that we're all in your

00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:44,480
membership SF is not for your

00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:46,400
corporation you can work for so if I go

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,600
work for another company my membership

00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:52,220
stays with me that's not a part and you

00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,010
know as I mentioned before we do have

00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,540
the back or about meritocracies they do

00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:58,610
turn into what I call Bennett but

00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,560
beneficial dictators for the life

00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:02,900
because that long people mask so much

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,600
merit that they have to be careful that

00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:08,460
they don't squash every adversity given

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,870
their their way they may do that very

00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:15,840
but is getting sometimes a Triscuit

00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:17,670
alright so transparency engineers

00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,590
sometimes go for a little bit too much

00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,960
transparency sometimes but it works out

00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,670
gently and so they didn't have a long

00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,590
list so it didn't happen in writing it

00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,850
didn't happen

00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:28,710
everything's hopefully archived and we

00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:31,290
use small baby steps so that things can

00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:33,360
be reversed I'm not so big on that one

00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:37,070
but that is part of our our core

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,070
sometimes I'm the one that pushes those

00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:48,660
are we so when I talk about the versity

00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:52,860
one of the people of bring up is my son

00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:54,330
my son has office and you know when he

00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,220
was younger we actually didn't know if

00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:59,030
he would ever speak but there were two

00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:01,530
is one where he stood in his bed and he

00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:03,300
wore us light your costume for about

00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:05,910
three years straight that we never keep

00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:09,360
on new ones for him but he stood up in

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:11,790
his bed I realized he was doing to

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,910
infinity not literally just by the

00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:17,340
feedings and you know that was one of

00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:19,590
the first clues that we had we were

00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,540
walking by a veterinary and he basically

00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:23,520
walked up to a wall and started going

00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,380
into of hood and we realized he was

00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:29,430
doing news foods which was this TV show

00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:31,010
where they had to find clues so one of

00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:34,440
the things I'm trying to look for is

00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:35,610
what is we they need to get started what

00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,160
do they need to get involved with

00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:41,030
community because all programmers

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,310
unfortunately we suck at documentation

00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:46,110
RTFM is probably a bumper sticker I'd be

00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:48,420
happy to put in my car you don't know

00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:49,950
what it means just ask later but you

00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,660
know the point being is people need news

00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:54,480
to get started so think about what the

00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:57,060
clues are in need for your community but

00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,150
anyway back to the Apache legs so it's a

00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:02,520
very pragmatic license is built to try

00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,960
and be visible in the user code so

00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,810
you're not always reinventing the wheel

00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:09,210
cross pollinate from different projects

00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:10,460
bring them together I keep making things

00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,750
bigger and better

00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:14,130
additionally it helps with risk

00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,960
mitigation so if you're worried about

00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:18,300
things like patents and licenses

00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,740
companies coming out to see you as part

00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,960
of what we build into our whole thing

00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:24,000
and what company is life

00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,980
one thing I heard was that if you do

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,690
fundraising is they control their

00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,360
destiny there's never an end of life

00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:31,649
with the product so if they like the

00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,330
product they use it they build a

00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:35,310
business around it they can keep

00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:37,860
extending it and doing things with it

00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:39,810
they don't have to worry about that

00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:43,160
project going layer that company getting

00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:45,450
bought or changing the way they do this

00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,730
additionally there's no copy left that

00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:48,870
principle this is sometimes really

00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,209
important when you want to get people

00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:53,220
involved in your project because you're

00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:55,080
not all the involving people sometimes

00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,910
you're involving companies so if you

00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,670
want to go to your boss and say hey I

00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:01,680
want us to use this product copyleft

00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:03,630
what that means is that basically if you

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,120
change the code and you distribute it

00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:08,040
you have to distribute the source I

00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,279
won't really get into it much more than

00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,490
that

00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:12,870
but that can be a verb that means make a

00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,209
lot of companies really really nervous

00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,740
so a lot of times tell people if you're

00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:18,660
trying to get a corporation involved

00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,670
think about positive things for holding

00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,470
the Apache Software license it's very

00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,670
pro-business and then you can start

00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:26,160
looking them at Qatar if you're making

00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:29,459
your own software start with ASF you can

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,400
always go from SF to GPL probably most

00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:34,350
popular license to do other places very

00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,720
very very difficult to go the other way

00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:38,430
around

00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:41,730
something to think about this is

00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:44,850
actually a quote from 2017 from a start

00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:46,560
and the start up hopefully right now we

00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:49,290
need this to be wired and this was a

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,480
quote about GPL which largely says that

00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:55,650
we ever got acquired the use of GPL

00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:58,560
software would be an asset and I will

00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:59,970
but it isn't big thing so if you're

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,620
thinking about others reasons Apaches

00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,390
out there it's a great way to get

00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,390
companies involved to get your company

00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:09,929
music open-source software because we're

00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:11,699
also under neutral one thing I this is a

00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:15,420
quote from me basically they're not

00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:17,130
about use our software start a billion

00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:20,040
dollar company we don't care that's what

00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:22,500
we exist for the public good includes

00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:26,059
corporations and people stone I'm very

00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:29,820
invite because the public comments laws

00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:31,800
limitations on software that you can't

00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,470
use it for certain sir at which point I

00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,900
don't leak to us work silently Paul

00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,419
source license anymore just uh it's just

00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,610
a business license at that point but we

00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:43,289
don't count that me better neutral then

00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,360
we don't put those kind of limitations

00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:47,669
on what you can do with this offer all

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,530
right so my final part this is really

00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:54,799
about more than occasion where I get

00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:58,890
depleted so I'm very big on this you are

00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:02,280
are in collegiate America's marker of no

00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:06,650
basis on age sex religion social status

00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:11,700
country of origin ethnicity getting etc

00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:13,440
you know the this is very big and when

00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:17,309
you're online one of the great benefits

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:20,940
of being online is in that community

00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:24,000
you're working long diversity be fixed

00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,890
by inclusion let people come in I don't

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,409
know I don't care really work everything

00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:30,450
I don't care they make I don't care if

00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:32,370
they're male or female I care if they

00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,440
can program or if they can write down so

00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:38,340
they can make Odegard speak with big

00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,659
graphics so focus on what they can do

00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,059
and what they can contribute to the

00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:43,320
community if they can do it don't pay

00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:45,570
attention the other thing to include

00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,280
those people that will think you're the

00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:51,600
versity issue just by having those

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,620
people start to get you additionally you

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,140
know when you're dealing with something

00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:58,169
like a big girl in houses what it

00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:01,610
basically it's a lot of things training

00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:05,909
very specific things to helping children

00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:09,000
but a key point of it is you don't don't

00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:11,490
encourage any behavior that you don't

00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,750
want to see them get it why that's

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:16,440
horrible

00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:18,600
don't encourage behavior etcetera and

00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,340
the problem is that there's negative and

00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,169
positive reinforcement all these kind of

00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,539
things but when this boils down to a

00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:27,720
matter that really is phrase that was

00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:30,720
invented before I started music back in

00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,750
BBS days Tim Freeman actually called do

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,610
not feed the energy creature DNF Dec if

00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,830
you get a person who's trolling just

00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:41,549
don't respond to it it's the best way to

00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:43,890
do just don't give it any energy and the

00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:46,020
I mention is because I know people who

00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,590
are energy creatures and wonderful that

00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,720
I

00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:50,220
breaking up he literally would go on to

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,350
the equivalent of a Christian bulletin

00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,809
board or the unchristian mailing list

00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,529
Brennan note that says there is no God

00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:58,230
logoff

00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:59,820
nevertheless in review knowing that

00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,429
there will be fifty thousand emails

00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:05,070
written back to that most of them is

00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:09,720
solely an energy preacher sucking the

00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:11,039
energy out of things and these are and

00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,259
sometimes these days it's trolls

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:15,149
considerably you know you have to think

00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:20,879
about what energy creatures even survive

00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:23,009
and if you can get it away from so I

00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:25,889
love this Venn diagram I use this a lot

00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:28,350
in my speeches and what I look for is

00:20:25,889 --> 00:20:30,419
the common ground for example when I was

00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:33,869
the VP of fun grades there's overlap

00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:36,269
between C corporations charities trade

00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:38,669
organizations things like that but where

00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:41,070
is the overlap in this person's skill

00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:43,559
where is what will help you in your

00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:45,659
project you know everybody's skills are

00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:47,159
gonna overlap 100% review all these

00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:49,559
things and think about the diversity

00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:51,059
think about what they can bring up to it

00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:58,169
what overlaps with your project that you

00:20:51,059 --> 00:21:02,549
need and focus on I won't talk about

00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:04,619
this over time I love this talking

00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:07,769
across languages trick this works really

00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:09,570
well as I've grown and Berta more in the

00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:12,629
industry I'm working a lot more

00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:15,259
international so if you go to translate

00:21:12,629 --> 00:21:18,509
like the new like calm you can basically

00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:20,009
mean something you write put in one

00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:22,049
language and then put it in other

00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:23,940
languages and translate it four or five

00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:26,429
times and then put it back into English

00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:28,409
if you can't understand it once you've

00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:31,259
done that you didn't write it simply

00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:33,960
it's a great trick for writing things

00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:36,809
especially where you're not sure if your

00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,769
what your rights that you understood or

00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:40,379
if it's going to translate across

00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:43,679
barriers or its use too many idioms and

00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:45,509
things like that so we see the

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,700
definition or the demonstration they're

00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:49,350
like you know basically go from you know

00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,080
one language that next to the next to

00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:56,039
the next act really great way of

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,899
sequence one additionally as I said

00:21:56,039 --> 00:22:00,600
before sometimes I look for ways to help

00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:02,830
people overcome their loss

00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,860
breaking into what they're doing

00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:07,540
I sometimes recommend people use

00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,160
gender-neutral in games things like Sam

00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,500
versus Samantha they've got some funny

00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:14,680
stories about my sister-in-law whose

00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:17,260
name is Sam but they were work very

00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,030
local there's pros and cons with it I'm

00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:21,010
not trying to tell everybody here not to

00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:23,710
be themselves but it sometimes you know

00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:25,450
can kind of get rid of this I know

00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:27,910
another one named Jim Walker

00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:29,650
you know they use an alien's idea that

00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:32,530
other than here the tracks will document

00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:36,730
that you sign your isolate which Matt

00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:39,400
here would be the old person you don't

00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:41,950
have to use your real name if you know

00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,500
one of the grief just use a different

00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:46,120
name they can really love sometimes like

00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,160
I said just to get over her nose a

00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,750
little merit and then for the most part

00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,030
you'll find the community is very

00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:54,490
welcoming but my goal is to make it so

00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:57,270
that you can get past those original

00:22:54,490 --> 00:23:02,590
things additionally there's some breeds

00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:04,210
talk about where you're located where

00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:06,550
your organization's that you can talk to

00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:08,500
things called cultural friendly are

00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:11,160
people who are willing to be blunt

00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,030
they're from that particular community

00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,800
additionally there's this great book

00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:17,520
site here there used to be a thing

00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,660
called functional compass but it largely

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:24,450
disappeared the bottle way do you know

00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:24,450
that girl is a common social compass app

00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,880
yeah I think it might have gone

00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:32,080
commercial that's what happened to

00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,050
there's ways out there to try and make

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,250
sure you're taking care of culture but

00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:38,980
because you know communication is such a

00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,750
big part of what we do these are four

00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:43,060
examples that actually happened at the

00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:46,510
ASF from Hermitage that I want to bring

00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:48,280
out so Canadian items in the US

00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:50,830
apparently were one of the few countries

00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:54,130
that if you have a little board meeting

00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:57,690
and you table something how many people

00:23:54,130 --> 00:24:00,550
here from the US and in any areas here

00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:03,480
okay so for the European what is it

00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:03,480
family if I eat

00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:12,040
yeah so here it means get rid of it or

00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:13,570
you moving it to the next time in a lot

00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,520
of European cultures it means to bring

00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:19,059
it up for a book so they're like near 80

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,610
degrees off so to table it needs to put

00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:24,910
it on the table and vote on it and a lot

00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:26,830
of European monetary terms but in the

00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:28,300
u.s. table it means we're not getting

00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:32,520
that this month we're going to deal with

00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:34,870
that next that can be a real source of

00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,870
interesting arguments we actually saw

00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:39,250
that a very very interesting argument

00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:41,380
going back with the people were two

00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,880
ships in the night not knowing what to

00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,540
say they were talking about two

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,179
different things

00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:48,130
well weather doesn't mean a lot people

00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:49,780
don't go in a parliamentarian with is

00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:51,760
your interests field you've got one good

00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,260
video but it has to be kind of a couple

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,990
of things but it's usually about getting

00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:58,590
kind of a straw what's what's something

00:24:55,990 --> 00:25:01,179
gonna happen is it a master plan and

00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:02,980
more called military organizations it's

00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:05,260
about trying to get things passed from

00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,550
one party or another survey with their

00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,100
own party in the shape I think that's

00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:11,440
where that comes from the third one

00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:17,470
actually was very interested we had two

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:19,690
out of nine working groups I didn't know

00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:21,429
that it was a you know we're writing on

00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:23,800
this documentation not endowments and

00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:26,559
how that work and never thought to say

00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:29,200
what an endowment is it's a way of

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:31,030
storing money and funding and

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,480
organization usually off B interest off

00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:37,150
from investing that money and then

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,360
finally you know that one's actually

00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:44,110
just horrible what is it Berliner that's

00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:45,700
the famous one the u.s. some people it

00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:48,870
was a person for Berlin if you pronounce

00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:52,480
it correctly but any final notes

00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:56,860
tomorrow there will hopefully it

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:59,860
especially first inclusion initiative

00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:01,809
it's been a lot of prison for Eleanor

00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,090
here and worked really really hard on it

00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:05,260
I don't know if a buddy will be here

00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:08,140
that you're not going to come and be a

00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:10,630
guest at the meeting usually gets

00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:13,960
thought but I also thought these two

00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:15,280
particular notes that came somehow lost

00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,020
the source

00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,520
weren't there we're really really good

00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:21,130
for talking about different diversity

00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:23,140
and the organization of this much

00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:25,000
diversity there gathering different

00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:28,510
resources about how make this work was

00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,430
successful what's not so anyway that's

00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:31,780
all that's all I have I hope some of

00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,920
that helps with some of the things where

00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,570
you're getting people involved into

00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,730
these or you want to get them all maybe

00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:38,770
some tricks you can use to get over

00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:40,570
those girl is it why those there was

00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:42,700
exist and things like that it was like

00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:44,380
for example I won't make an apology to

00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,240
the fact that we are a meritocracy

00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,860
I do think you have to do your own work

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,400
you have to put in some time and some

00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:52,960
some energy and come up to speed on
