Title: Diversity: the good, the great, the best - Michael Dorsey
Publication date: 2019-06-06
Playlist: Apache Roadshow Chicago, 2019
Description: 
	Diversity has been a topic for Decades. Diversity is even scarce when talking about veterans and tech. Veterans make up a small percentage of the United States however it makes up an even smaller percentage in the tech field. The advantages of hiring veterans are not only something that comes with tax break but also something that is very smart for both you and your company. veterans possess skills coming into the workforce brought for them from their military service. One thing a veteran knows how to do is overcome adversity, hardship, tough problems, and most of all we know how to lead and be lead. There are many misconceptions and myths about what a veteran is, how they act, and can they handle the ““ real world. Think about this, veterans can be a double minority. I will speak to you from both the standpoint of a veteran as well as the standpoint as an African-American male. We know that the tech field is dominated by a majority of Caucasian males with a very scarce selection of females. hopefully, by the end of the end, you will realize the importance of why diversity among the technical field is both needed and should be wanted as well as sought after.

okay good afternoon everyone

00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:28,830

00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:35,340
interesting michael dorsey : ground

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:38,030
rules before we have three routes first

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,789
rule is let's be honest with one another

00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:48,199
let's be open let's be transparent

00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:53,460
alright so my name is Michael Dorsey

00:00:48,199 --> 00:01:00,359
five-year I'm currently doing a software

00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:02,309
engineering practicing DevOps as well so

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:08,250
I'm the president of the copla tune

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:11,640
Alumni Association and also to before as

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:16,049
well so just a little bit about Co

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:19,439
platoon it is a program for veterans and

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:23,250
spouses it's a 14 week immersive program

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,950
and we pretty much go from not knowing

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:33,270
anything to full fledge full stack web

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:43,670
developers alright so for the next 20

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:46,950
minutes or 18 minutes or so because why

00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:49,829
everyone says all right well I have a

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,770
diversity training over you know we have

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:57,390
to talk about this it makes everyone so

00:01:52,770 --> 00:02:02,670
like I said three rules on this open and

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:05,729
transparent all right so we will have

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:11,039
just a normal conversation about what

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:13,470
diversity is visit and you know just

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,849
kind of some your ideas so I won't be

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,150
calling on some people you know to kind

00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:17,150
of share

00:02:22,440 --> 00:03:16,590
so there was a very interesting people

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,319
[Music]

00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:24,539
are already lined up perfect all right

00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:24,539
yes I like to proceed

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:47,860
so you guys bring out some really good

00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:50,860
points what do you want to touch this is

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:55,800
the definition of the dictionary what

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:58,900
diversity is a state of being that verse

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,480
describing the word interesting and

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,400
variety right and of course the first

00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:10,870
meeting about showing a great deal of

00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:14,680
variety very different being in the tech

00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:19,990
industry was very interesting to me

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:25,470
because like he said I walked into a

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:29,980
world where it is literary then so

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:35,380
alright that's no problem but I work

00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:39,400
around and there are not many I mean

00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:43,960
women there's not many people who are

00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:51,419
allowed or who are expanding so you know

00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:51,419
I definitely like it - I'm sorry I'm

00:05:51,960 --> 00:06:00,220
green alright so yeah you know it's

00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:03,220
definitely having amazing people makes

00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:05,980
it not just people just because of race

00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:08,710
but mixing people from different ideas

00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:11,230
different backgrounds someone's

00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:13,780
background and actually sheep how they

00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:18,640
think about a particular problem but you

00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:21,610
may not have so to me this that's that's

00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,919
very important it's important to have

00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:28,270
true that person when I say it's true

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:33,460
diversity it's it's a different story

00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:38,039
when you have let's say an initiative to

00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:41,539
you know to hire people color

00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:44,669
women or whatever the case may be well

00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:48,809
you know we actually have to hire them

00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:50,789
and not just see them and once they do

00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:53,369
hire them you know they have to feel

00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:56,189
included you can't have diversity

00:06:53,369 --> 00:07:02,249
without including us then diversity with

00:06:56,189 --> 00:07:04,169
me variety so they're so so well I think

00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:08,399
about diversity that's what I think I

00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:09,930
think you know let's get someone who may

00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:13,349
not have a tradition to throw your

00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,550
background and let's go ahead and give

00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:17,189
them a chance and see what they're all

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:21,469
about which is really important to me

00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:24,210
because I actually know the traditional

00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:27,629
route of schooling actually went through

00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:31,770
Coppola to myself and opened up a lot of

00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:33,809
doors for me and the first two years

00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:36,689
before I got out of military actual time

00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:39,809
step on a program and I would never tell

00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:56,240
anyone that because everyone oh no no no

00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:56,240
you have to yeah all right

00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:05,399
why should you kid people actually say

00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:09,589
okay well the diversity is someone

00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:12,569
else's problem let them worry about it

00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:15,180
you know as long as they're honest

00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:17,939
I'll stay in my corner not really ask

00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:21,529
any questions someone who looks

00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:25,319
different than me or talk differently

00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:27,949
but some of the reasons that I thought

00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:30,509
that was the most important was one

00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:35,519
productivity touched on this earlier and

00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:38,240
I actually found out that when you allow

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,740
people to speak of it allow people

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,539
comfortable speaking they just having a

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,470
conversation I got to tourists early

00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:48,420
let's just have a conversation right

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,630
that is when you start to get the best

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,470
ideas

00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:56,199
that's when you start to really get

00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:59,230
collaboration and really starts out loud

00:08:56,199 --> 00:09:01,569
equal to so it's a few little good and

00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:04,509
not themselves I feel good that hey my

00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:13,240
hand priority and that's really

00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:17,130
important and perspectives you know you

00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:21,389
don't know what someone's perspective is

00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:27,069
until either tell me or you've asked so

00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:32,949
I give you another story a really good

00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:35,529
friend of mine again and you know being

00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:40,899
in the military it's really different

00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:42,100
you know we go and you know deploy a

00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:45,970
little people for eight months and

00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:50,259
really is know all backgrounds all races

00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:52,269
and just people who actually you know

00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:55,389
maybe not even belong to the country at

00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:59,410
that time the military to become citizen

00:09:55,389 --> 00:10:01,600
and you know that that to mean really

00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:08,160
taught me about diversity and how to

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:10,120
just respect and appreciate so much but

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:17,500
going back to the story

00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:25,600
what are really good friends so yes we

00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:28,810
wanted to you know to see my arm and now

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:38,740
you know my really good he he's white

00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:41,740
but then as we were walking this way

00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:44,620
what kind of see if I one more time so

00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:47,110
no you know it's probably thinking what

00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,639
I'm thinking this is really weird biking

00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:57,279
on fairly really no need

00:10:48,639 --> 00:11:02,060
that's right well he actually thought

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:05,600
that black people did not

00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:08,240
a hair on their arms in their legs it's

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:12,470
okay it's you know it's it's it's

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,720
interesting the perspectives and until

00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:19,280
we have these conversations until you

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,470
know be kind of talk about you know what

00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,350
you're thinking you know the ideologies

00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,510
that you have the outlook that you have

00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:34,120
that you may not know the different

00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:37,640
cultures so to me that was our situation

00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:42,160
because I realized that there are a lot

00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:44,450
of people out there who actually really

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,870
aren't comfortable the economy's

00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:54,170
conversation and the reason why I say I

00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:57,920
might make you uncomfortable and when

00:11:54,170 --> 00:12:01,550
you make yourself purpose I believe they

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:05,900
do and it just allows you to kind of

00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:10,280
like it's a shock factor almost to allow

00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:13,220
you to see exactly you think about me

00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:17,600
what I think about you and aren't

00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:20,540
they're consistent you know what we you

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,940
know think about the world and having

00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:27,410
those conversations to really open up

00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:31,220
the doors to just to bigger better

00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:35,710
audience and actually going forth and

00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:42,530
making a change in the tech field and

00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:47,960
diversity gets on so original life

00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:51,710
experience learning enough different

00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:55,460
cultures and learning about you know why

00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:58,280
Phillip does you know I I can remember

00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:03,380
there were times where I was overseas it

00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:04,760
I didn't understand some things why

00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:08,030
people doing some of the things that

00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:10,430
they do and it comes get onto poacher

00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:14,700
and it really comes down to what their

00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:25,600
values are what they see that support

00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:30,790
and things of that nature so alright so

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:37,360
the solution I thought about this very

00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:41,019
long very hard and I decided to come up

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:45,220
with an app that solves diversity for

00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:49,170
you on how to gene select what type of

00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:52,540
diversity whoa boom tuck myspace right

00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:55,050
no no no thanks

00:13:52,540 --> 00:14:02,220
doesn't work like diversity takes word

00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:06,430
diversity takes initiative diversity

00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:09,010
really you know takes one person to

00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:11,829
change the mind of another person to

00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:16,839
allow them to grow an impasse that

00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:21,970
knowledge of well one of the things that

00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:25,959
Coco didn't actually do for for us is to

00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:30,579
the same learn all this crazy technology

00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:34,000
right and from there what we do is we

00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:37,570
give apprenticeships really with

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:42,339
different volumes and the reason why I

00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:45,910
like open is because one we we learn to

00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:50,890
work with people who probably ask us

00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:55,300
degrees to work with people who don't

00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:56,970
know anything about tech we work with

00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:01,019
people all over the world

00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:05,470
we just recently that's about in England

00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:09,579
but it's programs like this that kind of

00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:13,019
open up the doors to you or I guess take

00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:15,370
away one of the pain points that that

00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:19,350
tech companies have that's bothering

00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:19,350
this well ok if I hire this person

00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:26,589
or if I hire this person and I really

00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:28,629
know you know taught me

00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:33,159
well the good thing about veterans and

00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:35,649
the good thing about you know just being

00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:39,549
just having a diverse group like we have

00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:42,159
is the fact that one they definitely

00:15:39,549 --> 00:15:45,339
have my work experience already already

00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:48,609
none of the army Middletown to be that

00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:57,539
works group small ready so that's one of

00:15:48,609 --> 00:16:02,499
the good things about going to but more

00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:06,489
importantly I would say that you going

00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:08,829
back to anyone who's in charge of

00:16:06,489 --> 00:16:12,429
diversity or anyone who's firing just a

00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:14,609
show of hands anybody charcoal fire yeah

00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:16,329
okay sure

00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:19,569
especially the people who are in charge

00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:23,649
of hiring the best thing that I would

00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:27,359
say to do is to when you find these

00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:31,389
people liver they are to make sure that

00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:34,839
any ideas or anything that you have in

00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:36,759
your head about the person's background

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,009
or where they came from

00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:43,929
you want to take that you really want to

00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:47,649
push it out here and just I guess judge

00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:49,989
that person just agree that it's ER and

00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:53,739
even you know people will be harder to

00:16:49,989 --> 00:16:56,319
find hardly reminders technically and

00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:58,479
everyone was telling me you know you

00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:02,169
know there's not many there's not many

00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:03,759
people and you know you do that in a

00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:06,850
number like you know what are you trying

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,559
to say when they say well you know it's

00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:10,480
kind of hard freaking to the technician

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:14,879
this is whether it's what they're saying

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:22,689
right but come to find out there's

00:17:14,879 --> 00:17:24,990
100,000 jobs so it's important to just

00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:30,070
put those biases aside and have a

00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:32,080
natural conversation and say you know do

00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,279
you mind like this person facing off

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,610
well in the conversation that we're

00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:39,580
having now and not because you know they

00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:42,760
didn't go to the tutor school or not

00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:46,840
they look like me or they speak like me

00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:49,000
or they kind of accident do you want to

00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:53,200
take all of those by instance now you

00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,450
want to just say you know really trying

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,490
to get out of the conversation how can

00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:02,850
you bring value to the target

00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:06,310
how can you great value to the team and

00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:08,920
already capable of doing them those

00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:14,140
should be the Nerds and those would be

00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:28,770
the things that we say pretty much

00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:31,720
volatility so the future of diversity I

00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:37,660
personally would like to get to a point

00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:40,920
where it is not a second off but it is

00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:43,720
ingrained into our nature that we

00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,910
appreciate people for who they are we

00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,790
understand the value in them there are

00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:51,130
differences but Becky brings wrong what

00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:54,280
they can bring to our organizations or

00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:58,420
even on personalizing silence on one of

00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:00,340
the things that I love to do I just want

00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:03,040
to speak to random people you know you

00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:08,200
never know the story that someone has

00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:11,200
you never know you know what someone can

00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,530
teach you so I would just keep that in

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:18,010
mind

00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:23,700
and strive to have this being just not

00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:29,040
say it nature of what the nature and

00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:29,040
because I just wanted to share a little

00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:40,480
me but this is very true you know people

00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:42,670
say well bringing this back back to tech

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,040
you know when it when something looks

00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:49,390
different talks different walks

00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:51,090
different we're usually put off by it

00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,980
afraid of it

00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:56,300
don't understand it so we try to avoid

00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:59,700
it so I would charge you to being to

00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:02,580
take a different approach and run after

00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:23,220
it talk to someone that you don't know

00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:25,800
and make people it is not solely work

00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:28,350
with companies all over the United

00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,690
States but totally tuned to be located

00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:35,970
on once we buy South Clark downtown

00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:37,560
Scott and if you are interested if you

00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,160
are interested this is my contact

00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,800
information

00:20:38,160 --> 00:21:13,830
and you know you can feel free to

00:20:40,800 --> 00:21:18,900
contact me so I would say probably had

00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:23,460
to be right after I got help cope with

00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:25,230
zoom and the reason being is because I'm

00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:31,100
sure everyone knows that Impostors like

00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:33,540
them you know I had that time and I

00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:38,340
remember kind of interview with

00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:42,510
individual particular company and what I

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:44,070
did was I kind of let them talk and I

00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:46,230
was like I'm not going to really say

00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,830
anything I'm gonna say as little as

00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,270
possible

00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,100
because I don't know why even if I don't

00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:57,890
my secret and that was that I'm

00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:57,890
definitely and I didn't want seen like

00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:03,840
uncomfortable I don't want to seem like

00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,330
one right like I do not and there was a

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,520
why

00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:12,430
and that was beer than I had so I I said

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,750
okay I'm just like I don't really say

00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:17,790
anything because things start asking me

00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:22,920
questions I got really comfortable and I

00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:22,920
very quickly overcame that fear the job

00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,400
