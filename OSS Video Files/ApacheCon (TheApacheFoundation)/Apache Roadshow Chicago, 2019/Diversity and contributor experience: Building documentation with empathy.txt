Title: Diversity and contributor experience: Building documentation with empathy
Publication date: 2019-06-06
Playlist: Apache Roadshow Chicago, 2019
Description: 
	Aizhamal Nurmamat kyzy, Riona MacNamara

Good engineering documentation not only drives adoption and supports developers; it's also critical to supporting community contributors. Clear documentation of a project's processes, such as contributor guides and codes of conduct, are especially valued by under-represented groups and are vital to building inclusive communities. But in practice, 93% of OSS devs complain about the lack of good, reliable documentation, making it the #1 problem they face when working with open source software as GitHub's 2017 open source survey revealed. In this talk we will explore the journey for a person from being interested in a project, to deciding that they want to become a contributor, and how the lack of empathetic documentation can turn them away. This hinders a projectâ€™s ability to create a diverse pipeline of potential contributors. We also propose a set of principles, and practices for projects to adopt in order to drive inclusive documentation that will help to create vibrant communities. We will wrap by sharing examples of projects that have had deliberate strategies to build empathetic documentation, and what are some lessons to be learned from them.

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,010
[Music]

00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:58,439
traditions respected stronger and the

00:01:52,049 --> 00:02:08,039
business ecosystem is that start source

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:13,069
is scary and you can see this because he

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,069
was important to look at

00:02:39,140 --> 00:03:49,800
the survey is stronger and the

00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:51,780
variations also generally scary immerse

00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:55,230
yourself out there making ourselves

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:59,430
formal and one of the challenges that

00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:02,100
people have is that it can be very hard

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,630
to get the knowledge but you need the

00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:10,380
knowledge that you need in order to

00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:14,730
adopt it and abusers and absolutely it's

00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:18,180
very challenging and so we thought that

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:20,790
it was very important to understand how

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,980
we wanted to meet that the documentation

00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:27,100
is key area our arms more

00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,840
his keynote Bob talked about the actual

00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:33,900
rates right we will adjust paladin with

00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:40,360
the correlations for there to be trouble

00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:42,580
and access to information it's very hard

00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,250
to contribute time to probe point some

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,710
of the challenges that you see is try

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:51,250
knowledge another challenge that you see

00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:53,230
that I've seen forever is about the idea

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,270
that you don't even need documentation

00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:59,950
because all you need to do is read the

00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:04,840
code this is a where I protected the

00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:07,090
name because the idea is that you don't

00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,160
need documentation you can just go read

00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:14,890
the code just like tribal knowledge

00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:16,630
assumes that you have access to this

00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:20,520
kind of idea that you can just repeat

00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,520
the code you can spend a few miles to

00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:41,320
know how this information what can we do

00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:43,900
to support their journey open source and

00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:47,080
so we commissioned a study we wanted to

00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:51,010
find out how W trapped introduced to

00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:57,070
open source projects and Angela and it's

00:05:51,010 --> 00:06:00,430
constant so and I certainly wanted to

00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:03,130
know under no we had a question okay how

00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:05,680
can we attract contributions Wolcott

00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:10,060
revisions open source so we want a

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,520
terminal for our users what is very

00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,950
journey towards contribution and most

00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,080
importantly how we can support them

00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:19,690
every stage of their journey

00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,830
so commissioned a study we interviewed

00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:30,010
18 participants that have been actively

00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:32,110
using open source software and we asked

00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:34,000
about their feelings their past

00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:37,680
experience and pleasant experience of

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,320
actually to customers when the years

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,090
and how they feel about it and if they

00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:47,970
don't you think that's why I came to

00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:51,479
contribute and so we users in our study

00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:55,020
we identified for open source personas

00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:57,750
those like curious competent campaigns

00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,910
and leader and we went to say for

00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,370
something's not my person it's group of

00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:05,520
people that think or feeling the same

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:09,660
way and I'm going to talk a little bit

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:14,639
more in detail about each of them so

00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:20,669
cures that's me my name is Parker and

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:23,520
I'm a curious about open source and if

00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:27,000
you want to contribute back but we face

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,130
a lot of internal barriers I have severe

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,349
impostor syndrome I don't have much

00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:34,139
support like I don't know people who

00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:34,919
want to be doctors or so when I ask

00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,590
please

00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:38,160
all right hand and it showed me how it's

00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,990
done

00:07:38,160 --> 00:08:04,590
actual vehicle to do my first different

00:07:41,990 --> 00:08:07,979
how do we contribute mostly they're very

00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:10,710
engaged in the community they sent a

00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:18,630
couple of payments but they're not quite

00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:21,330
sold on the source they they they have a

00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:24,210
lot of mistrust and skepticism towards

00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:27,389
project owners what there's things like

00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:30,270
companies what is the value of my

00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:34,860
contribution show me show me

00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:37,950
and then we convinced but health actors

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:41,640
are they know the value of what riveting

00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:44,430
was old and they have time

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,700
commercial banks in the past they feel

00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:50,220
they know the project well if you say

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,450
the community but still they can't

00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,959
contribute

00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:57,480
why because like they don't have time to

00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:01,320
convince well they don't have reasons to

00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:03,959
convince their employers on value of

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,720
contributions what they say help me

00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:09,000
convince brain players of the power of

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,610
contributing orchestras but when I was

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,949
it was to become open-source ambassador

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:19,740
in my community and the first person is

00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:22,290
leader who contribute to Bianca both and

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,360
they provide mentorship they collaborate

00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:29,959
with other open source we they're still

00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,959
well supported behind their managers

00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:38,790
they don't they want more tools to

00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:41,670
convince other business units and other

00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:44,070
teams of value of open source value of

00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:50,220
contributing so but they want

00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:54,209
tools to scale and so these aren't for

00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:56,810
open source like respondus and as you

00:09:54,209 --> 00:10:00,720
can see they're different stages of

00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:05,430
employment with open source and we also

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:08,070
wanted to understand they each of their

00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,399
journey towards contribution understand

00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:12,000
which of the transition points that

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,680
don't matter

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:21,690
so we found that contribution term

00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:25,199
consists of three main steps first users

00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:29,959
gain exposure and from active project

00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:33,810
then the experience and external

00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:40,260
contributions finally active

00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:42,540
contribution so once once users did that

00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,690
and become more and more familiar with

00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,940
the project based and uncover what I

00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:50,639
still get more comfortable as users of

00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:54,810
an open source software thing which

00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:59,279
happened they like they run into a bug

00:10:54,810 --> 00:11:00,350
in the software or or the single feature

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,700
that mind

00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:12,230
so useful for someone and that's the

00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:18,110
trigger to think of contributing so when

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:20,390
they when they experience the trigger in

00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,790
fact that many like users actually doing

00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:30,170
simple contributing back into the

00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:32,000
experience this trigger and even when

00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:35,540
they start I was thinking of

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:40,130
contributing the biggest barrier is like

00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:43,100
they don't like they afraid of asking

00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:49,880
one question or being shamed like

00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:51,620
publicly and let's say they overcame

00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,830
death burn here and actually this

00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:57,890
negative country bit so when you sit

00:11:54,830 --> 00:12:05,980
there when someone writes speak so much

00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:09,290
for the project and they put themselves

00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:13,070
and at this point like project

00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:15,890
maintainers like they actually like this

00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:18,800
is where they can throw away that was a

00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:24,070
local support being nice to them and

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:29,290
acknowledging the contribution and yes

00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:33,490
so this turn it towards contribution and

00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:35,690
what the question is like how we

00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:38,480
community members of project maintainers

00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:46,960
how we can support them at every stage

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:52,030
of their journey thank you biggest

00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:52,030
biggest thing that came out a survey to

00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:57,620
tricky in getting started is scary

00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,630
almost well it's not just new

00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:05,090
contributors social experience

00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:08,420
introduces people to think things like

00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:11,300
asking the question sure we can have a

00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,950
friendly web moderation community just

00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,890
ask

00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:19,540
theory is impossible to overstate the

00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:22,960
value of the foundation is second on

00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:25,180
safety and we can help with this one of

00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,980
those is obviously we can try to build a

00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,630
culture where your friend you love to me

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:33,010
and ask me questions but a whole bunch

00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:35,410
of better so you should and one word is

00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:40,020
more accessible to people who are not

00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:42,040
always comfortable approaching West

00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:44,830
comprehensive documentation that

00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,570
explains projects organizations and

00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:54,520
governments and the needs of processes

00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:56,590
and area reach out and encourage people

00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,320
to make contributions for example by

00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:02,290
suggesting great first issues and this

00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:05,350
is where new contributions are welcome

00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:07,180
interests you may be a branding and

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:09,400
contributory you can bring something

00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,860
really valuable to the community because

00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,270
you can see you are new you see things

00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:18,040
that other people may be too familiar

00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:20,550
later and this is an idea we can create

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,810
it a welcome you told you not only by

00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:25,300
providing the information that they need

00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:28,120
for partnerships soliciting

00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:39,730
contributions and encourage

00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:42,310
contributions their journey one of those

00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:45,100
wanting to tackle fish isn't actively

00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:46,930
maintained as support you see cases

00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,640
how many can support this kind of

00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:56,590
technical decision making some great

00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:59,080
dogs really major partners they will

00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:01,270
also provide information that gave us

00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,780
some beautiful management of their team

00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:07,720
that's as easily lead to communications

00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:10,110
software they do that and we can also

00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,640
remember e

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,350
registration or under make sure that

00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:19,480
this information is pretty easily

00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:21,400
discernible and is clear and then we

00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,420
were actually using them called that is

00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,510
workable

00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,560
meet what I think is more

00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:29,020
straightforward to come technical

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,060
documentation they need to have collabs

00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,860
tutorials troubleshooting the

00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,170
information and very importantly

00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,090
architectural reviews because the great

00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:43,110
contribute to the project you need to

00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:45,660
know how to fix you to be overall

00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:48,370
structure of the project

00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:50,560
well routine set of documentation is

00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:52,950
also one of the indications for to tell

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,000
people look is the documentation

00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:59,340
comprehensive is it algorithm isn't

00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:04,000
change and that's extremely important

00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:05,590
already making contributions users

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,620
really need as we talked about

00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:11,500
psychological safety is we they're

00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:13,540
afraid to reach out to talk to people we

00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:18,100
need to make sure that the support they

00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:20,830
need is available and guidance and we

00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,990
need a culture in question computers are

00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:25,570
supportive of each other and that means

00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:29,110
that we need documentation there really

00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:32,260
was very our contribution processes this

00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:34,390
is what you expect and we also need to

00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:37,150
be able to support guidelines for

00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:41,440
materials ways that you can actually

00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:51,720
support your ghe and here's how you can

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:54,220
we just contributions to your projects

00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,960
and that's sorry the kind of

00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,460
documentation that we need to be really

00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:02,200
positive three points we need

00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:04,510
documentation community and disappointed

00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,940
use cases what the project is for and

00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:10,000
how it can be used for business use when

00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:13,150
you're deciding whether to advance you

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,400
need additional documentation period

00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:18,270
lands owned how many users and

00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:22,090
implementers oh you get these stuff and

00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:24,730
we need very clear documentation around

00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:28,000
military to the contribution process and

00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:31,680
this is meant here how we get started

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,680
also watch you inspect

00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:37,480
so that's the kind of documentation we

00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:43,230
need is that documentation look like

00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:50,170
Panama so we in our stead I mean

00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:52,210
probably right but what that is good

00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:57,670
documentation how they should look like

00:17:52,210 --> 00:18:01,450
so we asked them questions okay whatever

00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:06,010
is right so they have to satisfy this

00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:09,190
means they need to have the users for

00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:11,320
yet they need to help business to take

00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:13,510
him and also their condition needs to

00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:19,480
follow basic information design

00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:23,860
principles we first to but I wouldn't do

00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:28,930
anything to basic information design for

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:32,920
documentation okay so our participants

00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:36,700
they intercepted navigation is a major

00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:38,980
component of documentation they the

00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:42,370
documentation needs to be stronger it

00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:45,760
needs to be accountable legible readable

00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:49,980
solution and searchable and I'm going to

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:56,740
give you couple of examples of that our

00:18:49,980 --> 00:19:02,550
respondent because we are amazing job

00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:08,500
with documentation so findable so here

00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:11,440
it's a doctor service that for their

00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:14,970
documentation actually have this frame

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:17,680
rail table of what didn't our plans the

00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:22,710
depth and breadth of the documentation

00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:25,150
available also helps users oriented

00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:28,390
architecture of the documentation itself

00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:30,850
and the navigation label says trip

00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:31,900
please and very easy to understand

00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:35,700
there's no Charles

00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:40,960
they provide context for users this is

00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:45,610
and in other things cannot also for

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:49,330
users like it's like it's very important

00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:52,989
that documentation includes visual

00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:55,840
distinct references to the goals to

00:19:52,989 --> 00:20:00,340
grant access to what's mainly two

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:06,220
variables every stone here allow with

00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:08,950
the GS yes they do good job highlighting

00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:11,710
the text and really do complex inhibits

00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:15,669
them I lightning two variables central

00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:22,809
and also they have this very good level

00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:28,509
of content and another example is I

00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:31,149
torch the basic participants they

00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:33,730
emphasize that after getting acquainted

00:20:31,149 --> 00:20:36,970
with the project and developing a basic

00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:41,409
understanding they really need to dig

00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:45,489
into specifics so Google is great for

00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:48,669
short however if they're already inside

00:20:45,489 --> 00:20:53,230
the dog meditation they do have a way to

00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:55,570
search for the same for specifics and

00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:57,580
scoring playing something that they have

00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:00,850
already seen in this website that they

00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:04,960
want find that and the ability to search

00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:09,190
in the dog is very important and we have

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:12,909
my examples that we can share if you

00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:26,980
reach out to us but for the sake of yeah

00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:28,929
I will honestly communities really but

00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,379
the most important thing psychological

00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:34,749
safety

00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:35,350
users really need to community status in

00:21:34,749 --> 00:21:38,710
place

00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:41,769
knowledge is power good documentation

00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:44,499
that outlines projects organizations

00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:46,629
governmental it's processes enables

00:21:44,499 --> 00:21:51,220
people to do comfortable familiar enough

00:21:46,629 --> 00:21:52,869
to contribute just as the Apache ways

00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,869
that the decision making should be done

00:21:52,869 --> 00:21:56,919
in the open and then even is made in the

00:21:55,869 --> 00:22:01,309
whole make its

00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:07,309
this documentation is home to get tribal

00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:09,020
knowledge council heads of every finally

00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:10,880
do you need to make it as easy as

00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:13,760
possible for people to contribute and

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,429
people in the organization this do you

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,039
can reach out with suggestions rate

00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:21,710
versus issues as we have the same can be

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:27,529
responsible and creamed but we can also

00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:29,750
provide really organize citations it's

00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:35,710
also slightly circular table but

00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:39,380
documentation supports contributions

00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:42,529
good documentation to contribute and

00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:46,220
that goes around let's really foster and

00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:48,230
recognize their invaluable and new

00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:51,470
contributors and new community members

00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:53,510
are in a great place to identify what is

00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,580
missing for the documentation and to

00:22:53,510 --> 00:23:02,659
conservatives it is a great great way to

00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:05,620
start a little speakers here in yards

00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:09,320
angry inspiring we're talking about

00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:14,860
diversity and inclusion in aids our

00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:17,750
projects to go by putting information

00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:22,580
and making it accessible to everybody

00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:26,210
who's able to contribute not only our

00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:29,029
communities and our projects the

00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:35,750
knock-on effect is actually even with a

00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:38,870
new source of documentation is the

00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:40,700
importance of contributing to open

00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:43,309
source and it's growing importance

00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:46,159
getting entry and employment of

00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:49,130
Technology internal documentation

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:53,080
becomes even more because it becomes an

00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:56,750
agent of economic advancement it enables

00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:58,880
this technology and it becomes connected

00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:03,740
to social change so it's really

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:07,909
important and have less focus on mainly

00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:10,539
information there to technologists make

00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:10,539
a nation safe

00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:37,430
as you can

00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:30,499
thinner dogs so I would say what was the

00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:33,980
street least for people to do whatever

00:26:30,499 --> 00:26:54,879
is the simplest for me she used to crazy

00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:58,009
continues their existing with your

00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:59,990
spirit I actually don't know but there

00:26:58,009 --> 00:27:01,940
are basic accessibility parents that

00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:12,249
everybody should be following things

00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:12,249
