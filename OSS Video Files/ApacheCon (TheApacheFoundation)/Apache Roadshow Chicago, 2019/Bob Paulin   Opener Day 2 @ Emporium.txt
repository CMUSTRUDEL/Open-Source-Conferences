let me know if there's anything that you

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:15,869
think we can do better for next time

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:19,740
anything that we're doing right we've

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:21,509
got the schedule up today so I'm here

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,490
my list

00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:28,290
we've got lunch after we're done in here

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,460
and that's going to be back at

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,189
revolution so if you're not familiar

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,369
revolution is that way down the street

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:36,420
on this website if you're walking going

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:40,310
that way

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,750
this is emporium so we've got talks here

00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:45,689
this is going to be both the diversity

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,220
and the aptech track so if you're

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:50,159
looking for tops on that this is the

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,689
place we'll come back to after lunch do

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,750
you want to stay in revolution that's

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:57,299
where I'm going to be staying with in

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,250
Revolution which mines that that's going

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,960
to be the FinTech track so I'll be

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,259
running and emceeing within tech track

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,770
so you want the detectors to state where

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:10,770
your after lunch and if you're going to

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,200
go to made in Chicago the native is down

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,530
the street yeah

00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:18,290
Wall Street will be on the right so the

00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:21,140
nativist world will be doing the main in

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,849
Chicago track and we give twenty minutes

00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,260
because we talk so we need to travel it

00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:27,410
between the different tracks you should

00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:29,569
have plenty of time to do that so once

00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:32,270
again I just want to thank our sponsors

00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:34,580
who plough for being able to apply on

00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:37,790
this meter we've got three tickets and

00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:39,560
things up swag up front talk to Trevor

00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,090
you're looking for extra tokens and

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,410
tickets because we have them and you

00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:46,100
should definitely come up with those

00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:47,870
things we've gotta see that this way I

00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,519
did they got hats they've got all sorts

00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,920
of connectors and things like that so go

00:02:49,519 --> 00:03:08,660
check off and we've got so where are the

00:02:51,920 --> 00:03:12,980
Google people actually give you a

00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:19,100
preview submitted to a batch of cop so

00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:30,560
this is the short and if my screen

00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:32,720
decides to cooperate so this is a talk

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,609
about thinking about especially because

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,829
my lab work my work is an independent

00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:42,709
consultant so I come into project

00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:44,209
working for clients and the one thing

00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:47,000
that's not about all of them as a

00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:50,320
consultant you don't have any actual

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,090
power all you have is influence so

00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,190
coming from someone that works in open

00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:57,980
source and really likes the culture and

00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:01,190
open source trying to bring some of that

00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:03,739
sanity to your clients as is sometimes a

00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:05,840
challenge and it's one that I've kind of

00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:08,239
learned to deal with of being able to

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,850
bring a passion culture without actually

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,269
having any authority to do so many times

00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:16,220
permission even to do so so I'd like to

00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:19,190
share a little bit that way with you all

00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:22,669
today so just to start off with who's

00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:24,260
affiliated with the apache way see

00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:25,600
everybody should be doing this because

00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,630
there's no real quote

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,120
passionately so when I go and show these

00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,130
things we can argue and debate this and

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,970
it often gets debated on the list what

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:40,330
exactly this is but this is the probably

00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:44,290
closest consensus based definition that

00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:46,300
we have that nobody has like- monarch

00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:49,210
can be shot down so I'm going to present

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:52,300
this to you so you've got your code so

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,220
being able to have food that is maybe

00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,250
not perfect but meets the needs in

00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,550
community consensus driven decision

00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,100
making

00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,080
we're not dictators we are looking to

00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,520
build communities of people that agree

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,530
on certain things even though we may not

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,660
agree exactly we get to a point where

00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:09,880
were these not good enough

00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:13,030
open communication everything you do is

00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,800
public authority and a fat chick is

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,590
earned you're not giving up do you have

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,880
to prove yourself through doing good

00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,010
work

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,890
we're community of peers so there's no

00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:25,390
hierarchy there's really really two

00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,700
levels there's miners'

00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,620
pmc and then maybe above that you've got

00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,810
the floor but really the board is is

00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,810
servicing all those other groups so it's

00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,910
kind of an angle but really we're all

00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,070
peers there's no by hand to give more

00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,930
authority and then responsible

00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,750
oversights are doing the right thing so

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:46,660
we don't actually these are some values

00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,160
that we have and what most of my clients

00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,870
that are kind of agnostic to these

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,670
things don't realize these are values

00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:56,650
that if they have in their company would

00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:58,390
be very beneficial for them so what I'm

00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,600
going to talk about is some different

00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:02,860
things that you may want to bring to

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,890
your companies even if you don't have

00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:09,520
that title of PPE or director or manager

00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:11,140
or anything that would give you just the

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,630
same people do it this way because I say

00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:15,190
so

00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:21,220
but still get some of the benefits of

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:23,530
this culture these are the excuses we

00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,150
usually use when we're trying to justify

00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:27,820
why we don't bring these things to our

00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:30,640
companies but again we're going to blow

00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,170
those behaviors so the very first thing

00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,790
I want to start with is eliminating

00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:36,610
travel knowledge and it's very really

00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:38,249
lovable cat to feed but first thing I

00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,929
can find tribal knowledge because

00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:41,759
is it my turn this is a turn actual

00:06:39,929 --> 00:06:43,679
workers managers they were reporting

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,009
huge cutting excessively and he was not

00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:48,569
a happy person at all but it's that

00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:51,389
knowledge that are in your inner

00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:53,009
companies that don't get disseminated to

00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:54,749
other groups so it's like almost like

00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:56,399
Garden information there's the one

00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:59,879
person that knows what this database so

00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:01,589
this other application works and the bad

00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,469
things that leads to is you end up with

00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:07,919
plus factors of one in multiple places

00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:09,719
within your comments and this fall under

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,519
two kind of two of the different values

00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:13,409
is building a community of your peers

00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,749
and responsible oversight and

00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:17,489
eliminating these things and the things

00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:22,069
I've seen that it's helped in this area

00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:25,049
is being able to create documentation

00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:27,959
example content for the folks that are

00:07:25,049 --> 00:07:30,749
going to be coming in from outside of

00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:32,479
seven try and I think that's the really

00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:35,519
key terms when you're putting together

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:39,209
documentation or examples where you're

00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:41,849
trying to disseminate knowledge you have

00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:44,459
to be really focused on who those

00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:46,529
outsiders are to that that knowledge

00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:48,899
space so that you can write that

00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:51,959
documentation assuming that these people

00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:53,129
aren't in tune with any acronyms of the

00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:55,559
different way so you're essentially

00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:57,839
writing the documentation for somebody

00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:59,549
that is not in fact trying to possess

00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,499
the set dollars they're taking that

00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:03,659
approach when you have an open source

00:08:01,499 --> 00:08:05,639
project it's a very small group of

00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:07,619
individuals doing the actual work with

00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,839
usually a larger base of users so how

00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:13,559
can this mentality that I'm writing

00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:15,419
towards so Navin is not in my purely is

00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:18,599
a good philosophy to have on your

00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:21,029
building content on some of these things

00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:23,219
and just accepting internally that this

00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:26,360
is bad uh spectrums are bad and being

00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:28,649
able to articulate that your clients or

00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,599
employers

00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:33,209
transparent decision-making inside of

00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:35,399
companies people are making decisions

00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:37,500
all the time and many of those decisions

00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:41,219
are happening directly between two

00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:44,430
people many of those decisions don't

00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:47,370
necessarily need to be proud on one

00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,120
thing to do an Apache is we put all the

00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,670
things on

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,070
didn't happen unless they say it didn't

00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,630
happen so taking a philosophy inside

00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,850
your company that at least the decisions

00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:59,970
that I'm involved together I'm going to

00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,589
be posting it out to chats in a public

00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:05,310
channel for all those queries that may

00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:09,630
be engaged in that decision or acted by

00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:12,000
that decision and maybe that decision

00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:15,120
process open to all the players that

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,640
could be involved one thing that this

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,040
does is when you make decisions behind

00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,350
closed doors people don't always buy

00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,910
into those decisions because I wasn't

00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,250
involved hope you told me that this was

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:28,050
decided so I'm not going to do it by

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,110
making it public you end up giving what

00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:32,339
I am and that's what most decisions is

00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,630
the idea is I'm going to make this

00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:36,890
decision we are going to make this

00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,890
decision and then we're going to

00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,929
[Music]

00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:53,820
participate but there's always people

00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,589
working junior developers people that

00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,060
maybe are feeling comfortable enough to

00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:58,770
speak up because they're not really sure

00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,029
whether they're on one side of decision

00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:03,510
or they don't have an opinion

00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:05,130
necessarily but blaming all those things

00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:07,170
out on the public create something

00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,610
formal mentoring channels because people

00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,830
are watching this decision-making

00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,779
process they're seeing how the decisions

00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:16,890
are made by people that may be more

00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:18,540
senior than them or have more experience

00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:20,430
than them in a certain area and they're

00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,730
able to take that and apply those

00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:25,980
cultural norms to what they're having

00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:28,140
full request even if you are an

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:31,620
important book benevolent dictator on

00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:33,180
your internal project having people on

00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,860
your team reviewing your work you know

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,630
you could you have to commit access I

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,400
could just put it in there but taking

00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,380
the approach with you know what I'm

00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,690
gonna have somebody on my team Beauty

00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,730
even though I might be the most senior

00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,020
person here taking that approach giving

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,400
them the opportunity to look at your

00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,440
code look that's how you've made your

00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,910
changes your approach to that if you

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,940
have questions ask those questions

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:56,640
creates a lot of informal mentoring

00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,680
together none of this I don't I don't

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,940
eat like my boss is approval to do this

00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,940
I can just do it

00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:11,730
and finally emerging of that planet but

00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:14,520
diverging measured pristine so a number

00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:17,190
of folks on projects they want to make

00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:19,530
changes that maybe they don't have or

00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:22,200
they're worried about somebody coming

00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:25,710
down on that or perhaps criticizing the

00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:30,440
work one of the things that we do it

00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:34,530
actually is we make small reversible

00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,840
changes as kind of culturally you know

00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:39,030
we get a big blow request with you know

00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,770
30 modified files from somebody we don't

00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:43,740
know that bus is probably gonna get

00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:46,950
tonight before a lot of people by

00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:49,230
encouraging other developers to create

00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:51,440
those small incremental changes we can

00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:54,480
also encourage them to take some risks

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,680
those may involve making some mistakes

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,750
or maybe they can defend something

00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,780
that's not the perfect way that we would

00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,950
do it but by letting them commit into

00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:05,490
their Buster as long as they're not

00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:07,020
creating any harmful situations they may

00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:10,800
get the opportunity to learn from that

00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:12,300
of others at the pure group reply and

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:17,160
tell them well you know have you

00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:20,280
considered this route to make the you

00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,410
know some of that involved as a person

00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:27,240
on but it can stepping back and letting

00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:28,890
these things happen and finally the last

00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,440
thing is when were working on projects

00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:34,170
we don't always agree so being able to

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:37,620
have constructive dissent on your

00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:39,840
projects it's very critical because when

00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,780
we are deciding on frameworks when we're

00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:45,510
deciding on features directions and

00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:49,860
where things go actually has a nice

00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:51,000
bottle of dissent and +120 and the

00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,920
negative you know

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,330
the driving forces to get everybody

00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,550
where they're in that plus one so

00:12:54,330 --> 00:13:01,500
everybody agrees but when that doesn't

00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:03,690
happen we have rules in place of wet to

00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,600
set looks like if you're going to plus

00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:08,970
zero something means I don't care it a

00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,250
lot of times being able step back and

00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:13,900
say you know this doesn't impact me one

00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:17,440
way or another is

00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:19,210
good way of allowing the other team

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,270
members to kind of assert their

00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:26,410
authority versus you always blessing or

00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:29,140
denying the negative one they've used

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:31,270
properly is a powerful way that if

00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,890
you're going to dissent you're not doing

00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:35,290
it on the basis of authority but you're

00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,850
doing it on the basis of merit based on

00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:40,960
the argument that you're making of why

00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:42,310
this is not only bad but harmful if I

00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,530
need to prevent this from happening

00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:47,140
because it's going to hurt us God might

00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:49,750
not it's I don't want this in there it's

00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:54,310
going to actually cause harm to the

00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:57,130
project so these are just a few steps a

00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:59,800
few things that I've used honor on my

00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:01,870
clients in the past without any formal

00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,280
learning that is thought and if you're

00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:21,760
looking for the longer version of this

00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:34,840
talk thank you very much lunch at

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:59,800
revolutions so that's so enjoy yourself

00:14:34,840 --> 00:15:02,440
to the moment and enjoy the second of

00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:05,620
those policies making sure that there

00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,450
are there is reviewing and looking at

00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,250
the comments to make sure you know when

00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,620
people are offering dissent and offering

00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,660
feedback there's a reason for that

00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,090
feedback so when I'm looking at a full

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,770
requested and a lot of this is people

00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:19,630
are watching what I'm doing and they're

00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:21,760
trying to model after that behavior

00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:26,750
because they want it they see it can be

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:29,000
effective and they want to model that so

00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:31,430
being able to allow some things that

00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,680
maybe I know are not perfect route maybe

00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,870
comments say hey this isn't perfect but

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,879
this doesn't make it worse it does make

00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,319
it a little bit better and we can fix it

00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:42,980
later it does no harm to the community

00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:44,720
like a lot of developers have come from

00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,360
that mindset that there's a right way to

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,209
do things and if it's not right it can't

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,949
go ahead and kind of breaking down those

00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:55,160
barriers has been one of the things I

00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:56,779
think I know these founders they're just

00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,850
looking for somebody to do that because

00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:02,689
a lot of times you get the people this

00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:07,300
year just a coder so it's a it's a

00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:09,529
global thing it takes time as far as

00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,089
policy though I think your questions

00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:12,920
around policy you give me a little bit

00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:18,529
more clarity on that or is that sort of

00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:19,970
where you are conscious processes I feel

00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:21,350
bad when you're going to have to come to

00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,389
the full length block because I don't

00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:25,490
have enough to look beer or lunch to

00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:29,389
actually go into all the policies

00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:32,600
practices but that will be I will be

00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:46,759
sure to cover that a long time any other

00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:48,980
witness all right those are you making

00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:52,519
this your home base want to do that

00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:54,860
that's the track I'm diversity that's

00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:57,939
into tanks so taking off please come

00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,939
