Title: Michael Ghen   Customer Segmentation and Marketing Automation with Apache Unomi
Publication date: 2019-06-03
Playlist: Apache Roadshow Chicago, 2019
Description: 
	Customer data is collected across the organization in different technologies like client relationship management systems and mobile application databases. A customer data platform (CDP) helps business users collect all the customer data in one place, providing a complete view of the customers. Apache Unomi is an open source CDP that is attractive to both business and technical stakeholders. Developers will appreciate that it uses ElasticSearch for data storage and offers a REST API interface. Business analysts will appreciate persistent and consolidated profiles for all audiences that integrate with big data systems. Apache Unomi supports real-time decisioning using a rules feature and provides an easy way to develop custom plugins to add functionality. This session will look at the advantages, business cases, and logical architecture of Apache Unomi. The goal of this session is to introduce the audience to Apache Unomi and provide a technical demonstration of profiles, conditions, actions, rules, segments, and plugins. This session is accompanied by Github repositories where you can download and run some demos using Apache Unomi: https://github.com/mikeghen/unomi-docker https://github.com/mikeghen/unomi-tutorial Apache Unomi is a powerful new project and with this quick introduction, you'll be able to decide whether or not Apache Unomi will be right for your business needs and you'll be able to quick get a proof of concept up and running.

	00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:10,290
tell me when a couple minutes early

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:14,299
because maybe there'll be some time to

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:21,779
grab a sandwich down the street for that

00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:25,109
but Michael anyway very excited that my

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:27,269
son here from benefits trust own State

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,580
Justice University didn't understand how

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:48,020
about Bitcoin you may not get into this

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:48,020
presentation with a said I'm actually

00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:57,329
Khamenei you guys take about I reach

00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:01,079
technology people a little bit about it

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:03,899
because we do use Adobe back in so

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,970
nobody here to talk about that today my

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,260
mother for this talk is that I want to

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,720
know what to get enough information that

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,580
they could leave and be able to evaluate

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,229
a passion you know me in their own

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:18,509
organization so I'm not there's a lot it

00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:20,759
definitely kind of focuses some of the

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,009
things that I found our bases are the

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:29,040
most useful parts and the core parts of

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:31,409
Adobe so just a brief overview this talk

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:38,880
I do have some links up here that if you

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:40,950
do want to go online today conference I

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,229
want to just introduce you to passion

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,020
you know me some of the ideas or

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:49,350
concepts that make up value proposition

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:52,350
or you know me and then talk about a

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,640
little bit about segmentation works and

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,659
then the main thing that I want to focus

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,810
on is rules

00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,299
conditions and actions these are kind of

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:05,630
the core pieces I was using I'm mostly

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:08,369
interested in Montreal cash trades dough

00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:13,860
because of the rules engine problems

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:15,629
which I'm sure some people run into just

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,400
a little bit about me I do do a lot of

00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:21,360
ACORN stuff I'm a computer engineer

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,730
I really have a little bit of a

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,410
technique market and intact background I

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,410
actually do a lot of health care and

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:30,300
social services and like I said I found

00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,300
it recently finding a company reusing

00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,530
you go on the back end they have any of

00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,910
this stuff on here in chess you

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,290
definitely get in touch with me

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:44,540
afterwards the talk about it okay so

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,540
unless you know music customer data

00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:51,840
systems you might not have heard this

00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,370
EDP acting before they check out the old

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,920
trends to actually get more popular of

00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,290
search basically what it is is it's just

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,110
a package of software that's easily

00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,879
deployed to redesign for marketers and

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,629
it's designed to address a specific

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,310
challenge that you have with providing a

00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:11,340
custom tailored user experience for your

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,230
customers or for your any money working

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,209
with and the reason that that's so

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,280
challenging is because all of this data

00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:19,650
lives in different systems what a

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,780
customer data platform for my special

00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,760
place where you can consolidate all of

00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,860
your customer information and it also

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,840
provides a good interface for getting

00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,599
that information for other systems that

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:35,370
want to use it either for analytics with

00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:36,780
Roc Nation so I'll break this definition

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,739
down a little bit more and just talk

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:43,680
about the first part is packaged

00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,120
software so customer data platform like

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,650
other platforms are you proximately

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,930
which is provided and kind of a package

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,030
of 4matic that can be deployed onto your

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,830
own infrastructure even out without

00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,720
writing logical some code and that's one

00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:58,909
of the reasons I kind of like this so so

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,909
for you know me it's the Java and these

00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:14,640
contributed for running doctor to help

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,799
with the evaluation and production so

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,720
that's a package that we build the

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,549
resistant a unified customer database

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,220
Portuguese

00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:23,810
most attractive part because well that

00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,270
gives you this with really easy ways for

00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:29,000
your information and it gives you an

00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,710
easy way for marketers get access to

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,319
that information and use it to drive

00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:38,030
action and stay ultimately impact the

00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:40,340
business value so you know the backend

00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:42,470
here is actually a last search so that

00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,840
you know me uses elastic search on the

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,099
backend versus in deep storage and to

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,440
the most part your customers from your

00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:52,550
photo is a single JSON objects option of

00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,620
documents elastic search and then this

00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,659
last part here is ridings most important

00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,280
part and it's the part that really

00:04:56,659 --> 00:05:00,530
attracted me in peace with you know me I

00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,810
find this interface difficult to create

00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:05,060
and maintain on your own and this is

00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:07,310
just getting information into actually

00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:10,250
domain coming from public places many

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,199
different websites and then also kind of

00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:15,349
accessing the information for eternal

00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:25,430
purposes whether that be analytics for

00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:29,120
marketing automation and what we do is

00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:31,819
we basically control routing calls and

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,270
text messages from patients who are in

00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:37,279
recovery to the appropriate case

00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:40,210
management specialist or certified

00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:43,759
recovery specialists we currently are

00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:46,090
we're currently working to pilot this in

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,500
Pennsylvania with women were pregnant

00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:51,919
and basically what we're trying to do is

00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,690
create a coach system and we want to be

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,460
able to remind this custom user

00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:58,430
experience and the way that we do that

00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:00,590
is by building some middleware this way

00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:04,940
to actually know me and several other

00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:07,729
systems so or you know what attracts

00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,139
people to us we actually use slack to

00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:11,000
manage all these conversations because

00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:14,090
slack is actually good with the clients

00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,659
that's put on the back end we have a lot

00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:20,539
of rules and segments that help us

00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:23,360
classify clients and help us provide

00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:26,090
real-time analytics about what are the

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,039
needs of these patients and you're

00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,320
heavily focused just individual privacy

00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:32,570
issues security Reuters valuation

00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,400
personal person communications not

00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:38,620
necessarily writing consecrates we don't

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:41,540
really like to write a custom grid a

00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:44,090
little diagram in fashion you know me

00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,640
that you'll find online just syrup shows

00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:49,760
this view and what you'll see is there

00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:52,580
is incoming and outgoing traffic on the

00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:55,220
left slide so in far side to see from

00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,990
different webpages and mobile apps app

00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,780
actually you know me offers an interface

00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,340
to collect events it also collects

00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,530
allows you to have an interface to kind

00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:07,010
of update profiles but a lot of it is

00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:08,450
event driven and then to pull stuff out

00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,330
you know me it's kind of work where

00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:13,550
you're getting back out of context so

00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:15,290
next time a user comes to your site you

00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,990
might have tracked their session or

00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:19,880
cookie have an ID and so next time they

00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,740
come to your site you can post an

00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,070
experience or you might get their

00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:27,290
location and by weather experiences

00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:29,360
necessarily say this context the idea of

00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:32,150
a context server and patching and

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:36,010
patching immediate context server comes

00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:37,190
up a lot in fact I believe it's all

00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,870
right

00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,780
before I get into context server which

00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:43,160
is interesting the book is for today I

00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,600
just want to make sure that people

00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,250
become familiar with these concepts

00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,290
because I believe it if you understand

00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:51,230
that you know me and you can see these

00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:52,670
concepts work all of the other stuff as

00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,430
far as there is a analytics.js

00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:57,260
integration forgetting but traffic that

00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,720
you're getting web minding information

00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,040
in that's all very easy i think these

00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,450
are very hard to see because for the

00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,690
most part actually you know me as kind

00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:07,760
of a back-end API there is no front end

00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:10,790
for a package moment so they were

00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,110
working on releasing a front-end so that

00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,180
it's a little bit more obvious the

00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:17,210
students going on I'm just going to kind

00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,590
of show it back into that alright so

00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,410
some of the core concepts you need to be

00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:24,980
familiar with there is the idea of base

00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:27,320
item you know me and in elasticsearch

00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,120
there's a general data structure that we

00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,880
referred to as the i/o basically it just

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,330
has an idea type and then from there we

00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:37,820
met all the other data structures so the

00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:40,940
profile is our basic constructs for what

00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,400
is a user the idea here is that in

00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,920
Apache knowing

00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,920
research a profile is just a single JSON

00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,720
document and inside that we feel like

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,550
properties about the user we also

00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:56,800
maintain information about scopes and

00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:58,000
lists as as you have a user kind of

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,490
interacting with your site and

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,080
generating these events actually know me

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,910
has kind of a bed collector where you

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,380
can plug all these events and then

00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,970
everything is kind of designed around

00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,100
sessions so when you're collecting

00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,470
events and that's all happen in a

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,700
session and if the most probably these

00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:17,020
these are terms that I think people

00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:18,850
might be familiar with so as far as like

00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,160
a business case or like how does this

00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,630
get deployed out there two diagrams that

00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,120
have been in previous presentation so

00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:27,130
I'll just talk about the first case here

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,180
is providing kind of a custom experience

00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:33,400
the browser so in this scenario the user

00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,790
visits the site and then at some point

00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:38,980
the browser actually goes down to

00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:41,560
passion and on the contact server to

00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,210
treatment context back and then after

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,910
getting that context and even getting

00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:47,740
the profile or creating a profile then

00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:51,850
there are interfaces for sort of

00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:53,590
exchanging those events similarly with

00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:55,750
the global average who have read things

00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:57,010
that are kind of going on here so again

00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,770
at the first one where you sort of

00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,630
figure out who is this person and then

00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:04,480
the next one week after the accession

00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:07,030
number to use it well and then from

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,560
there we can kind of maintain events and

00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,540
we can also provide personalized

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,720
experience either by going from the app

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:15,730
to know me or from an intermediary CMS

00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,000
they might be interacting with cows you

00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:21,790
know we need to get things and this is

00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,400
this model here is effectively a model

00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,330
that we use we have a mobile app and in

00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,790
the middle of that we have our

00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:30,280
middleware or C in that system our case

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,960
management system and then the backend

00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:36,010
of all or something so our case

00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:37,930
management system is not actually all

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,580
right now eternally in common we might

00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,710
not be intuitive

00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:44,770
are these here and user absolutely hit

00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:48,250
the road beef up as you know me and in

00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:50,890
general they should be able to

00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,930
understand so conditions are basically

00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:55,550
just boolean logic right says someone's

00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:57,200
income is above 12,000

00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:00,110
can also be strung together so you can

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,660
make a larger community so it's income

00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:06,440
over 12,000 and they're female and they

00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:08,000
may be pregnant actions and you don't

00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,370
mean there's a default set of actions

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,630
but these are basically things that are

00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:16,760
codified in Java that can be triggered

00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:19,700
so for example the second property

00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:22,040
action there's also email actions and

00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,630
things like that one of the actions that

00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,890
I've contributed is just general web

00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:30,350
caption helpful and when we combine

00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:32,630
together your rules or combined together

00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:34,670
conditions and actions that is how we

00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:37,910
create a rule so a rule might say if

00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:41,060
someone's income is under 12,000 and

00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:43,220
they're female then set a property

00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:48,080
action that says they're likely eligible

00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:49,670
for our services and very similarly to

00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,020
rules how I think if you understand

00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,750
rules it's very easy to understand

00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:56,540
seconds say mister basically just rules

00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:58,340
without actions that only actually like

00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,690
add them to the segment so and when

00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,430
you're creating a segment you're

00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:03,440
basically just defining a condition and

00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:09,200
then you're fighting what say that they

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:11,180
should go into it maybe definitions so

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,830
the big reason that I want passion you

00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:15,110
know me and was so drawn to it was I

00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:16,880
found I saw these all JSON days and no

00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,730
custom code for the most part this is

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,890
that one person yes so here I sort of

00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:24,800
have an action the set property actions

00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:27,250
are built in the action and basically

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,500
what we're just saying this action is

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:34,430
just set the property the eligibility

00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:36,860
property on the profile - yes now we

00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:41,780
also have a way of kind of extending

00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:47,830
these matching airflow boxes very

00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:51,350
similar with extension so basically just

00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:53,030
implementing the action executor class

00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,920
and then all you have to do is to find

00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:56,180
an execute method so you can do anything

00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,920
in the execute method so you can make

00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:02,360
any number of actions on your own if you

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:04,100
know Java Java into your extensions

00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,339
right

00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:10,360
so just in the same way that you have

00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:12,620
the actions there's also condition so

00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,019
here we just have one condition that's

00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,480
just basically made up of two sub

00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:18,920
conditions and you can kind of see I

00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,509
like this example because it might not

00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,000
be any of the holidays how to kind of do

00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:24,980
the and because of the json hold on will

00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,649
tell you is if you try to try and create

00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:30,019
an interface on your own rules engine to

00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:33,199
interpret this kind of json data

00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:34,730
structure in my buddy's not reveal and

00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:36,589
so i really like that you kind of this

00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,940
you see here basically were saying their

00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:40,279
annual income is less than twelve

00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,620
thousand and in this scenario were just

00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:44,420
saying that their profile is updated so

00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,880
this this is a condition that is only

00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:48,319
true when the update happens so when

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,959
there when the update happens with their

00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:57,170
income then we the condition is true

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:59,720
it's not true after that because okay so

00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:03,230
i have a reasonable toriel here to just

00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:06,800
demo some of these concepts so i still

00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:08,410
have open those of you may be following

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,880
along or if you now when you're alone

00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:13,730
it's just a mike getting and go me

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,560
tutorial i actually recently contributed

00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,910
this is the website as well so you can

00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,720
find some of this on the apache to the

00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:23,240
website resources tutorials i just want

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,889
to sort of show you kind of how do you

00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,860
start your because there is again there

00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:31,220
is no front end so briefly who i have

00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,319
going on on my computer is I just have a

00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,690
doctor running with elasticsearch and

00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:39,649
you know me and this you can get running

00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:42,170
and repository posit or II I basically

00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:43,940
this is just an easy way the alternative

00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:46,069
would be to kind of assault on Ubuntu

00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:48,350
that are so this is just these wake it

00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:51,079
up for evaluation purposes and with this

00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:53,209
running I on the web browser here

00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:56,899
basically what we can do is we can see

00:14:53,209 --> 00:15:03,470
that certain so here's kind of more

00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:04,519
profile looks like there so in this this

00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,279
post which might be a little difficult

00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:09,800
to see to localhost colon 8080 one I

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,660
have ten points in the contact server

00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,190
that you can kind of look at there's a

00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,380
whole series of available and

00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:17,460
points and what I was saying earlier was

00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,280
like some of these more advanced

00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:22,500
features full and scoring I have and I

00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,660
mean relax get into them we're still

00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:29,490
working on the segments but there is a

00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:31,290
lot here to explore so we must look at a

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,970
general profile they all have some of

00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:34,800
these like system properties so it's

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:38,520
like what segments are the end where

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,950
their scores there's a advanced feature

00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,260
around urging duplicate portfolios you

00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:46,590
can find merge rules which is super

00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:48,000
useful so anyway let's just jump back

00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:50,550
here for a second I can just sort of

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,140
show you what we have going on so the

00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:54,030
profile you saw earlier had a little bit

00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,620
more information in the properties

00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:57,240
you've had there pumpkin things but this

00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,190
is basically the start of our portfolio

00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,890
and for the purposes of this I'm just

00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:03,240
going to change their ID to wants that

00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:06,210
we can actually show it's a new

00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,300
portfolio profile in creating being

00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:12,360
created and as you can see it's almost

00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:15,840
as simple as basic HTTP off request to

00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:18,740
the server so like I said earlier with

00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:21,960
the REST API called restful near face

00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:24,900
they aren't actually some of the people

00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:30,810
that PMC's are exploring graph API as

00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:32,070
well but for now I just have so before I

00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:34,050
did I actually also want to show one

00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:37,050
other example there's also the idea and

00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:38,400
you know me of sessions so you do want

00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:41,790
to work with the Mets there are other

00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,440
things you actually need to tie this is

00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,970
something that communion is so looking

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,120
at what you do need to turn the tie

00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:49,860
things to sessions so if you create a

00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,690
portfolio profile and they want to do

00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,420
track events you need to have those

00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:56,010
events within the context of a session

00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,870
so there is a way to kind of around this

00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:59,760
which is if you just created every

00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,200
portfolio creates one session we don't

00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,330
have to even really need that ideal

00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,760
session so we just great portfolio and

00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:07,829
in create a session with the same ID so

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,589
every portfolio profile has one session

00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:12,089
in the future they do rules for social

00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:13,290
foot so I just want to show that and

00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:14,970
just speak to that to where you have to

00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:17,550
kind of first create the profile and

00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:19,199
then you can create the session and once

00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,780
you're free to profile you created a

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,100
session

00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:24,730
you're all set to start tracking all

00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:27,130
your events right I'll just go back and

00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:29,169
just sort of show the one profile and

00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,150
I'm just gonna real quickly run this

00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:35,919
little bit of code which I have here

00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:42,730
just to show you that we created a

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:45,700
profile okay so the new profile has been

00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,840
created and I can just use the rest

00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,900
interface just to kind of look at the

00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:52,600
API or look at the profile Suzy's first

00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:55,210
name and last name for now which is

00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,980
pretty straightforward

00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:58,840
so now at this point what I want to show

00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,780
you is took me a little bit longer to

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:05,110
figure out with rules so earlier I was

00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:09,789
speaking about people being if their

00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:13,330
income is less than 12,000 and and then

00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:16,210
update I have that codified here we sort

00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:18,250
of saw someone the code earlier in parts

00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:20,380
but the first part we have is our

00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:23,230
condition so this is just saying that

00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:26,559
income is over their income is less than

00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:29,830
12,000 and that would be the property

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,929
annual income so on their profile we're

00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:34,150
looking in with that like properties dot

00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:36,520
proper name syntax you're basically just

00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:40,510
indexing into this last research

00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:43,419
document and then the second point down

00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:48,789
here which is the action so basically

00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:50,830
when that happens in real time we set

00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:52,809
that property on it and again here's

00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:55,840
that same syntax you get more

00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:58,110
complicated with this syntax because

00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,280
it's all elasticsearch a lot of

00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:02,620
interfacing with you know me you know

00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,809
elasticsearch is kind of a pass-through

00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,490
so for example searching profiles is

00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:09,820
just you're passing for lots of

00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:12,549
surgeries so in this scenario I just

00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,049
basically first create the rule and then

00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:15,730
once the rule is created

00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:19,120
what I do is I go ahead and just issue

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:23,950
an update post and I said that profiler

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:25,790
just have $10,000 to Nelson so when I

00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:30,290
run this I'm going to do the same thing

00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:32,150
instead before I run I just would show

00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:38,720
you know the pro violet does not have

00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:40,100
any first last name okay so the you

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,660
might notice 204 which the blank

00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,790
response something I've been looking

00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:45,470
into okay

00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,820
that's telling me I created rule and

00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:49,460
then the second one is telling me that

00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:51,440
I've updated the profile and you'll see

00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:54,020
that already even you when I get the

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,330
profile right back right away has that

00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,280
eligibility it is real-time that's one

00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,620
of the core features of you know me and

00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:03,320
that's one of the core challenges

00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:06,110
opposed people believe that maybe they

00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,850
can make a better segmentation is engine

00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:12,260
which is like how do you scale that's a

00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:15,950
fine building people and thousands right

00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:16,820
and do that no time and still actually

00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,620
no meeting from a performance

00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:20,900
perspective is still evaluating that and

00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,100
I believe the solution that communities

00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,520
coming towards this integrating with

00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:28,040
Kafka or using Pony spewed up to know

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:32,090
about I want to tell you is that the

00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:34,040
people PMC circa and once Joe hi I'm

00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:36,020
marketing I believe in Switzerland they

00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,550
are running in production I believe five

00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,530
million people and about Thousand Hills

00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:41,300
it's working fine with that they

00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:43,340
addressed the issue with just scaling up

00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,290
their research possible clusters and

00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,270
things like that so anyway McCarley

00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:49,460
interlude

00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:53,810
so if we go back to the profile and sort

00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:58,610
of look at it I know it's actually the

00:20:53,810 --> 00:21:00,290
let me just change the IP feared I want

00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:02,900
to make a new profile site it's not

00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:05,390
actually magic earth so that's actually

00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:10,720
showing you this it's real so here's our

00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:10,720
profile or what a one profile at the

00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:37,969
so I don't you know sometimes one of the

00:21:33,989 --> 00:21:40,289
things that only amazing I've see is

00:21:37,969 --> 00:21:41,789
these understanding which one is a

00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:44,369
comparative which way is it doing the

00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:51,539
comparison so if Memphis tried the

00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:54,359
opposite direction well I'm gonna do the

00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:57,059
big magic bed and then so basically you

00:21:54,359 --> 00:22:00,299
get your updated rule and it just adds

00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:02,429
eligibility to yes so when these rules

00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:04,080
are valuated and if you find the script

00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:05,729
for the rule i'll just show you what the

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,249
document fool looks like because you can

00:22:05,729 --> 00:22:12,950
see all your rules in a nice like JSON

00:22:08,249 --> 00:22:17,070
format so if I do rap I have this save

00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:18,479
so if we look at the rule itself you can

00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:20,729
sort of see that it does kind of keep

00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:24,059
these conditions this is also super hot

00:22:20,729 --> 00:22:26,399
before a previous rules engine I had

00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:28,589
created with someone where all of the

00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:29,940
rules this is why commonly see is all of

00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:30,869
the rules that have ever been created

00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,929
are Optimates

00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:36,179
as code the nice thing about you know me

00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:38,190
is all was created or saved of JSON

00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:40,409
documents and elasticsearch and so

00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,299
viewing all the rules updating welcome

00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:47,789
it's actually easier it's not just sort

00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:49,979
of so now we're demo which I thought

00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:53,489
everyone was ok with and the last thing

00:22:49,979 --> 00:22:55,679
that I want to do is just talk not which

00:22:53,489 --> 00:22:57,690
is like let's hear about extensions

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,339
integrations and just for general you

00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,559
know me architecture for those of you

00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:05,639
interested so I was not familiar with

00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:07,979
crop up it's interesting and I like the

00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:12,779
idea that you can kind of deploy your

00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:14,940
own extensions into the broth believe

00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:18,359
it's like the runtime environment or the

00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,649
code it's kind of a doctor so I really

00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:21,029
like that because I've written like more

00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:22,469
extensions and without you don't

00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:23,519
necessarily need to commit them in you

00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:25,510
know because you can actually just

00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:28,570
brother pumping in the moment broth

00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:30,220
and it will know through all this GI I'm

00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:31,750
speaking on topics I'm not so sure how

00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,279
we work but I've got them towards

00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,110
success with me and they're really great

00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:38,049
but you can see there are a series of

00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:40,889
services here and one thing I'm just

00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:42,549
going to say about the architecture is I

00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:46,630
personally don't feel comfortable

00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:48,279
building something at this scale with

00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:53,440
the features that have wanted and so

00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:55,809
having the guys in Switzerland other

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,700
people working on it makes me really

00:23:55,809 --> 00:24:01,750
comfortable using it and makes me really

00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:08,289
from a business perspective really

00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:10,720
excited and as far as the integrations

00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:13,029
goes and extensions goes there are

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,919
connectors that exist I haven't explored

00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:17,019
these too much there there's one example

00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:19,570
from MailChimp for Salesforce there's

00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:21,330
also a call for connectors so if you are

00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:23,919
looking for opportunity to contribute

00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:27,010
you know creating a connector would be

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:29,470
very well-received and then where I kind

00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:31,899
of place in the plugins so give you kind

00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:35,740
of write your own plugins I do believe I

00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:37,690
have just just to show you a web hook

00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:43,240
action plug-in actually found this

00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:45,789
process I'm a bad person but I actually

00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,440
found a process of creating this to be

00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:49,000
very straightforward very easy again I

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,130
showed a little bit earlier you're just

00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,510
creating your own execute method

00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,919
the harder part of doing this is

00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:55,960
actually figuring out how to do a post

00:24:53,919 --> 00:25:00,779
and Java not necessarily out figure out

00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,779
how like they know me so that would work

00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:09,399
hearing this and thinking that this is

00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,769
great and it just doesn't have that

00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:15,530
integration needed to stay in touch

00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:16,649
because I feel like this so the code

00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:20,350
[Applause]

00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:22,720
started so yeah thanks for attending

00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:25,960
anybody happens to know anything about

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,970
in the space for social services and is

00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,539
interesting about earlier with my use

00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:33,690
case group at you know me definitely

00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:33,690
thank you

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,580
next patient system like identified like

00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:58,520
news news news lockheed u-2 profile

00:25:49,580 --> 00:26:00,110
service considerations that's a good

00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,610
question and i guess it's gonna happen

00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:04,100
sort of diagram we don't have an

00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:06,770
authentication system with you know me

00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,830
because it's sort of a machine based off

00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:11,539
so they're the people that we interface

00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:13,730
with you know me they're actually not

00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:15,200
going directly to you know me we don't

00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:17,659
build a user interface on top of your

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,909
Dobby so the it's really just what

00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:23,059
application wants to get data out of you

00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:25,490
know mean for now as we handle it and

00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:27,110
then the way that we block off

00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:30,230
information is with you know these

00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:32,570
scopes so if you notice on the profile I

00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:38,380
was showing earlier there's actually a

00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:41,029
scope list for profiles down here or

00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:44,029
there will be a though essentially gives

00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:46,580
scopes property set and with that you

00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:49,159
can control who sees water and people

00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:51,620
converted with those scopes there's also

00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:54,890
a user lists and so you could put people

00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:56,270
on different user lists that way as far

00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,159
as just anything that often I think was

00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:00,230
your actual questions no I I don't we

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,970
don't use that as I'll go into it but I

00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:03,470
think we've metadata up on the profiles

00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,970
you could achieve that same result and

00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:08,000
that in fact that's exactly how we do

00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:23,240
like the concept of a service network or

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:24,740
service source yes no tools we build our

00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,450
own front-end because what we're doing

00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:29,809
is so simple it's basically counts right

00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:32,630
counts in time from time series so as

00:27:29,809 --> 00:27:35,720
far as tools you could connect to it

00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:36,649
anything search because it's all elastic

00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,779
search in the backend

00:27:36,649 --> 00:27:40,100
there's another thing that's kind of

00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:42,080
tracked about you don't need something

00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:44,149
that you'll hear other talks about no

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,980
means because it is all just back to the

00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:50,179
last search you can completely

00:27:45,980 --> 00:28:48,650
my ass you know me Java server and go

00:27:50,179 --> 00:28:51,770
into elasticsearch that way I know your

00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:53,450
question I believe it if it fails it

00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:55,760
will write to the logs and don't think

00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:57,200
there's any sort of other handling so I

00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,460
think we can it was a little

00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,570
embarrassing that mine wasn't working

00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,100
but I'll tell you what was probably

00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:04,610
happening if I look at the logs like

00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:07,700
something walking logs so yeah if your

00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:09,919
bed fails I can't I don't know what

00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,240
underlying mechanism it's choosing from

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,880
a technical perspective to do the rules

00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,410
evaluation beyond I know that you know

00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,270
when I said earlier about the scaling

00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:19,460
that they have one thing I'll say about

00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:22,100
my rules is that I find the rules was

00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:23,990
really hard and the thing that you saw

00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,220
me flip greater than less than that I

00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:27,590
spent like a day trying to figure out

00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:29,590
its event update thing so we have the

00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:32,720
rules that we have here about five girls

00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:34,640
we have to test they take a little while

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,870
right but what we do like is once they

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,990
get right they're actually not so bad to

00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:42,080
edit like yeah and I don't think it's

00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:44,059
any failing you know me too I think just

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,840
my understanding of how it's designed to

00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:52,190
work you still do great question another

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:54,470
one elastic results including at least

00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:57,640
until somewhat recently obviously

00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:57,640
against people using

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:12,630
definitely late I was sitting that these

00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:14,789
guys that's what your question I didn't

00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:18,419
actually hit that was a thing like see I

00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:19,980
do think the trend and maybe I deserve

00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:22,980
asked is to go towards something like

00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:24,870
Kafka and I and I think with that it's

00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,750
as a replacement through last research

00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:29,520
or maybe it's something the persistent

00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:33,200
storage that lots of search would then

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:35,880
kind of using or not using as system so

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,100
no I don't know anything baked in them

00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:41,340
for it I just know the direction is kind

00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:43,590
of cockroach streaming to address some

00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:54,890
of the scaling and the speed of

00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:54,890
