Publication date: 2019-07-08
Playlist: Apache Roadshow Chicago, 2019
Description: 
	https://www.apachecon.com/chiroadshow19/talks/breaking-into-open-source.html

We use it at work, we use it at home, in 2019 open source is all around us. Most of us only see the end result whither that be the apps we use or the binaries we import in our projects. This talk will give a behind the scenes look at all that goes into open source projects. Learn the differences between projects run by individuals, foundations and companies. Find out ways to contribute even if you’re not a coder. Finally learn about some of the common processes and responsibilities associated with contributing to an open source project. Over the past 20 years open source has had a huge impact on the future of software development. It’s been said the best way to predict the future is create it. Come find out how to be a part of the future today.

very true

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,890
so with this talk I had the great

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,439
pleasure of introducing myself and my

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,329
good friend here Michael Donnellan we'll

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:40,350
be talking about reading into open

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:44,640
source so so let's go so just to lead it

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:47,520
you know usually I don't but the purpose

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,440
behind this clock is to kind of remind

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,449
everybody that you know a lot of times

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,770
you go to a conference and people talk

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:54,660
about getting into open source

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,969
contributing to open source like this is

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,800
a big unicorn thing you contribute to

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,410
open source and suddenly you're a person

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,510
and this is why we contribute open

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:07,049
source because it's charitable thing to

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:09,450
do in fact being in the ASF here to

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,060
Software Foundation is a charity so to

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:15,390
Germany there is another charitable but

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:19,380
at the end of the day that's not the

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:22,229
real reason the real reason we

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,259
contribute to open source is because we

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:28,369
rescue there are things that we work

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,750
with the open source this is what's that

00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:32,220
we will get to that the time but I mean

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,159
we've got to talk we gotta set this

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:39,659
thing up first

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:42,030
so our time has a bit of an edge to it

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,500
because of that we're not going to be

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,350
talking about unicorns we're not gonna

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,399
be talking about that happy bad things

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,189
we're going to be talking about the

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,380
needs of get you're contributing to open

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,630
source that you can't get anywhere else

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:59,100
and as this talk is a little bit edgier

00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:01,380
we haven't been internal so if you can't

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:07,020
reach your hands who here is not seen

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:09,720
maybe better ok cantle people

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,989
Breaking Bad is a show on or basically

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:17,790
about a couple met meth cooks

00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:20,700
so we based it talks like Twitter on

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,319
that theme so there is implied violence

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,390
apply joint you saw like and stuff

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,880
that's uncomfortable

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:32,220
here's the door this is not to talk to

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:34,200
you right all right so let's just start

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,390
with just a simple introduction so

00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:41,360
didn't really introduce who I was other

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:43,860
than saying I have a member of the ASL

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,350
right here in Chicago that works on a

00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,170
lot of different technologies mainly in

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:51,450
tech and ecommerce I worked with a

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:56,940
number of different stacks from Johnny

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:59,220
he or not reported to you know back-end

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,750
systems and patchy camel integration

00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,180
through and through

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,549
I'm a podcaster and we're actually be

00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,250
broadcasting one of those podcasts here

00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:10,769
in this bar Java long heat so stick

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,599
around for ten we'll be doing that and

00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:15,060
also on the pub house which is the kind

00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:17,750
of a more educational podcast off

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:21,660
yuppies are talking expungement Monica's

00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:23,040
speaker retired see Joe presidents very

00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:31,739
involved in the open source community

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:37,500
here so is that I don't know Michael

00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:39,239
Manila so Michael you know I'm not an SF

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,290
well I'm Bennett Internet

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:45,900
i bill I'm one of the spring engineers

00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:48,900
so I mean it's pretty matches let's put

00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:55,769
test I have an author or speaker also a

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:57,660
dark champion well sort of one would be

00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:03,900
extra food Virginia starts with a batch

00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:05,970
process already so I'm will give our

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,160
contact information so if you follow us

00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:13,440
we're saying mixed classes too if you

00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,850
want more than plan all right

00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,299
I think this is you you like to talk

00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:20,729
about how software's even for all so

00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:22,409
everybody has heard this software is

00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:23,700
eating the world that's what that's what

00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:25,420
everything is going on so you're about

00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:29,740
all the different IP

00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:33,010
what not it's almost like you know mm

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:36,520
again I guess calm you know blowing up

00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:37,060
with a software but that's not really

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,320
the case

00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,470
would you really happening is

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,760
open-source software is you a lot of

00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,860
these things we've been possible without

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,400
open source technologies if we look

00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,850
around

00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:52,810
most of you whose IQ is based on open

00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:55,180
source stack there's business building

00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,190
with energy source there are lots of

00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,810
talks throughout these next two days I'm

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,540
various open source projects there are

00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,760
contributing business value to all these

00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:06,340
different just they're coming you should

00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,700
what about you know how to mention

00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,700
pulsars

00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:14,110
I'm sure we were on the room beam off

00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,770
different open source projects everyone

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,590
here Susan

00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:23,110
so choosing open source software that's

00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:24,910
where big room is hair alright so to

00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,800
start but to start with let's define

00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,780
what is open source so that we know

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,490
exactly we're talking about Michael and

00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,700
I come from kind of different angles to

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,200
the open source thing if you will so

00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,180
we're going to talk about that as we go

00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,970
through our let's first talk about how

00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:50,620
we define open source and much of this

00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:52,810
is taken from the OSI definition of open

00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,090
source so let's get why don't we start

00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,460
off after that so the very first thing

00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:00,610
and this is probably the most obvious to

00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:02,500
all of us is free distribution of the

00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,470
software so there's nothing that we can

00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,720
do that puts any restriction on how you

00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:15,090
just repeat the software should all be

00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:17,140
free and clear source code so there's no

00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:19,090
deliberating by any reason keeping the

00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,740
source code there's also no appreciation

00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,570
of the source code so I can't deliver

00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,720
the source term you know first aid we

00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:27,400
investigate this is stuff with secrets

00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:32,020
are hiding anything within there this is

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:34,030
the actual rate something I should be

00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:37,270
able to take those things that are open

00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:38,449
and data to me and derive other works

00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,689
from so

00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:43,520
only be able to use the software

00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:45,439
modifying and this is where a lot of you

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,680
know the earlier licenses branding the

00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:50,300
problem didn't extend all of this to my

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,059
the apache license is one of them that

00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:57,620
allows drive works it's just how you can

00:06:53,059 --> 00:07:01,219
deal with that activist integrity of the

00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:04,839
author source code so when these derives

00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:08,449
works you still have to maintain what

00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:11,029
went the original author date so for

00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:12,949
example if I'm consuming some software

00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:15,080
project as an open source project even

00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:17,089
if I divide things from it I still be

00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:22,669
able to write source from the original

00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:25,550
authors so we're not allowed to

00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:27,650
discriminate against groups that use

00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,509
this software or persons that use a

00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:32,689
software now this is a very interesting

00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:34,909
one as of late because of the changes

00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:36,949
that a lot of open source companies are

00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:40,699
putting their licenses to deal with

00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:42,680
Amazon so one of the things that we've

00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:44,960
been seeing in licenses recently as well

00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,139
is all over the source but if you're

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,589
going to be a cloud provider what I'm

00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:54,199
providing it's not free to you one of

00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:56,389
the reasons that those licenses are not

00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:59,120
falling under the open-source umbrella

00:07:56,389 --> 00:08:00,860
is because of this clause and that's

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,099
there for a reason you're not allowed to

00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:06,080
discriminate against big Amazon or you

00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:10,339
know Mountain hotshots whoever is going

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:13,849
to be using your software there's also

00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:15,889
no Romanians feels that whenever you've

00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:18,199
done research in software licenses

00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:22,039
there's a really interesting examples of

00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:23,149
this don't use this technology a nuclear

00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:28,899
reactor

00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:32,630
don't use the URL of uses software yes

00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:35,959
well there's no evil clowns right so

00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:38,930
that's JSON that work yes the no evil

00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:42,130
closet so all of those technically fall

00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,130
against this tent

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,689
so yes you heard it here you can use the

00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,689
patch

00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,670
so distribution of the license the

00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,440
license should also be free to

00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,200
distribute with the sovereign you can't

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,180
have any weird restrictions on whether

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,780
you know the legal text of the license

00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:09,460
is protected by some non-disclosure or

00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:14,050
lab although that means meeting the

00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:17,740
Queen no finders license can be

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:21,760
submitted so the real thing they're

00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:23,530
trying to avoid here is an open-source

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,120
license for a piece of the product and

00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:27,070
then to get the phone thing you have a

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,230
bunch of different license that's really

00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:31,480
what they're trying to avoid here so way

00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:36,310
to do that is basically places shouldn't

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:39,280
be limited to a single piece of

00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:42,310
technology it should be generic to any

00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,500
type of technology to the appropriate

00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:46,180
things you guys you realize this is an

00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:52,060
example of that it doesn't talk about

00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:58,030
job it's very generic when it comes to

00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:59,650
what technologies a specific license it

00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:02,080
also can be restricted to other software

00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:05,070
there's a number of open source projects

00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:09,460
to be written to say hey we didn't

00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:13,260
Windows or Linux but you can't put it

00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:15,820
get the license that this off or be not

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,830
so I mean there are certain things that

00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,170
even if the community decides not to

00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,970
implement those things you can't legally

00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:27,790
enforce that colonizes

00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:31,390
oh yeah so licensing being technology

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:34,420
neutral again bringing up specific

00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:36,790
software even license does not you know

00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:39,460
violates it being considered open source

00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:41,950
under the US side definition and a lot

00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:45,670
of these you don't need to UM put every

00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:47,020
couple years something comes up where it

00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:50,290
starts challenging one of those things

00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:53,530
like the Amazon but the anti Amazon

00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:56,650
Cloud licenses so even though obscure as

00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:58,930
some of these may sound the future is

00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:00,340
kind of interesting that you never know

00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:04,800
what these things are gonna come up and

00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,800
kind of challenge that definition so

00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:10,990
so they one of the more most important

00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:13,450
things about open source software is it

00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:16,450
it's more than just code so we talked

00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:18,850
about the license but there's legal

00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:21,880
aspects that you come through there is

00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:23,500
documentation aspects and a lot of the

00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,480
other talks of this conference are going

00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,400
to be highlighting different ways to

00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,770
contribute and different ways to

00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:33,190
interact with communities that do not

00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:36,070
involve just the source communities and

00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:38,920
and open source is really about

00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,360
communities it's about people and much

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,330
of this talk is going to be going

00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,490
through how those things can work for

00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:49,390
you and make contributing to open source

00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:52,750
a personal thing to help you and your

00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:54,940
career and your companies out rather

00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,980
than just thinking hey I'm donating code

00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:01,480
to the ASM because it's nice to get the

00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:03,400
chair so with that we have several

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,070
different types of communities that

00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,450
exist in open-source we're going to walk

00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,550
through three different kinds of this is

00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:13,360
one of the places where we invite will

00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:14,980
come from kind of different areas so

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,480
we're going to talk about are known

00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,150
areas but I'm gonna start off which is

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,860
talking about kind of the individual

00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:23,500
model so this is the East how many

00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,480
people here are stuff on you just know

00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,180
we're just sitting out there and good so

00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:32,140
you are all individual open-source

00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:35,440
software communities so when you play

00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:36,850
something yes we make of the people

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,280
entries there and to me people

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:42,640
explicitly chose a license for the stuff

00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:47,140
they put out there there's only into

00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:48,760
next because one of the things that

00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,850
comes along with running your project is

00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:54,160
an individual is you are on the book or

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,470
all the things associated that project

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,180
whether it's building the community

00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:59,770
dealing with the legal aspects that come

00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:04,660
along with running those resources

00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:06,280
project dealing with having people come

00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,260
into your community and maybe you know

00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,660
trying to contribute things that are

00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:13,270
that's what the project is trying to

00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:16,250
achieve these are all names that as an

00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:18,410
individual we deal with and some of it

00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,690
is easier being so because you don't

00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:22,670
have to coordinate with other people you

00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:25,790
get to be what a lot of people refer to

00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:28,340
as the benevolent dictator or life or

00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:31,160
your project so you get to make the

00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:34,610
rules but you're also the one subject to

00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:37,220
all the words and as a user of

00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:41,930
open-source there's a lot of risk behind

00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:43,490
if you decide suddenly to go do

00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:46,310
something else as many of us the

00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:49,100
software non-penetrations shiny objects

00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:51,860
a lot of the time what happens to that

00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:55,460
code what happens to the people that are

00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:56,750
using that code base ding come on Zuma

00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:03,710
think this was just going to continue

00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:06,050
forever ever so being an individual and

00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:09,080
working in these and in this environment

00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:10,090
is a bit Kristin so what starting to

00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,100
happen

00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:15,290
20 years ago maybe even a little bit

00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,730
before that if we started to see

00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,400
foundations papa

00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:21,860
so foundations like the attachment

00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,500
Software Foundation we're going to try

00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:28,610
to make this process of bringing code

00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:32,690
out to users that may be expecting it to

00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:34,550
be around for the last longer by having

00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:39,140
shared responsibilities so one of the

00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:41,750
things we as provides as a legal cure

00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:44,750
there is a people may lend us their

00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:48,530
support from the foundation when there

00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:50,750
is questions about IP ownership what the

00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:52,970
foundation Canada can do with the code

00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:55,240
what users can and can't do

00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:57,080
if that needs to be provided so

00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:01,760
foundations allow some shared

00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:04,790
responsibility for sizes one example of

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,440
one of the things BASF does specifically

00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:09,589
with their computers so they try to keep

00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,510
the bar very low for committers getting

00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:14,600
involved in project we generally don't

00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:18,070
need your employer's approval or

00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,780
anything to contribute though with easm

00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:24,170
contributor it's being committed by

00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:26,690
somebody else the burden of making sure

00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:29,490
that is read clear is on the person to

00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:31,589
know who here is an azimuth at you

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:35,190
their responsibility if they're the ones

00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:36,810
responsible so for me that was kind of a

00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,459
new thing when it was brought when I

00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,920
agreed that I want to legalize it's like

00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:42,450
oh so I contribute somebody else's code

00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:47,339
and they didn't do their due diligence

00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:48,630
then I'm kind of on the hook for me one

00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:50,010
of the things that was done

00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:52,620
intentionally to make the foundation

00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:56,430
free of that language but it puts new

00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:59,370
liability on each individual so that is

00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:02,250
one of the things that is - das optics

00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:04,200
they contribute at level very low your

00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:07,020
interview you don't even are late if

00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:13,440
your commander long as ratings you have

00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:16,470
to be responsible it also insulates the

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:20,730
foundation right exactly it's done that

00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:23,220
way in order to absolve the ASF the

00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,830
individual ought to have their hand you

00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,750
could be liable you're the one who do

00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:29,600
the one responsible for making sure it's

00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,890
in the map now does this happen

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,829
sometimes doesn't mean you're going to

00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:39,680
get sued probably not many projects

00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:39,680
depending on these problems involve a

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,600
they try to do as little harm as

00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:49,500
possible honestly who wants to smooth

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,029
like y1z free foundation like most of

00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:55,770
the time people understand these are

00:16:51,029 --> 00:17:10,920
smaller expose large amounts it's really

00:16:55,770 --> 00:17:15,890
works on empty the pockets of care so it

00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,890
makes it attractive missing people

00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:32,429
so there's another model that has also

00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:34,309
come up become very popular - I support

00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:36,570
research too much so

00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:38,850
does lower in the US the venture

00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:40,650
software foundation projects I'm a

00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:43,130
spring committer so we actually follow

00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,130
different mouths

00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:49,390
or that is pivotal employees all the

00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:54,409
major committers to these great craters

00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:57,110
and the models literally we have a a

00:17:54,409 --> 00:18:00,919
higher bar to entry it's become a

00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:03,799
competitor where eventually 4:02 be

00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,960
committed we actually asked it if you

00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:08,360
were committing a month what we weren't

00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,760
as a nun from the batch from you to sign

00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:15,110
a seal it and a lot of times that these

00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:17,840
will require your employer's but one

00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:21,380
that the difference there is i is

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:27,230
employee not taking on that concern that

00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:30,070
ownership that grease where is Bob he is

00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:33,190
instead it's my employer taking better

00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:36,019
also if I can hit by a bus with my

00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:41,620
company so we also get filled in that's

00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:45,649
why it's going to weigh down or ESS

00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:47,899
situation maybe the best of the kid but

00:18:45,649 --> 00:18:50,720
there's nothing getting foundational

00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:53,720
corporate governance model perspective

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,990
that is going to guarantee continuity as

00:18:53,720 --> 00:19:00,769
as the materials were of leadership

00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:07,450
patents so it's only got the way right

00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:10,039
there's four bottles of communities and

00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,330
each one master person counts and when

00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:13,220
you're choosing open source software

00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:16,580
these are all things to meet the way

00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:18,889
we're coming near you did you regret how

00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,149
big the deals that would be greater to

00:19:18,889 --> 00:19:22,370
let you do that

00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:26,299
do you wanna lose your position on this

00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:28,880
part what is if you know the main person

00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:31,159
behind it is anyway I must what happens

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,289
to me them all those kinds of things

00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:35,210
means going away when you look at one

00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:40,340
such project that's run by one of these

00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:41,809
tomorrow's all right so we've gone

00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:44,330
through the different bottles of

00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:46,190
contributing so let's get to the real

00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:48,440
beauty this is why contributes to the

00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:50,269
office so there's a number of different

00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,419
reasons and again we're starting at the

00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:54,559
selfish feel-good stuff about the things

00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:55,580
that are actually going to do good

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,200
things for you

00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,570
so the first thing we're going to

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,909
address is your company's benefits

00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,799
because a lot of times we live in kind

00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:06,679
of a captive audience of people working

00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:09,230
for all of us are independent so we have

00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:10,789
to sell this thing to our company and

00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:14,779
say why isn't words

00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:16,070
so for companies maintenance reduction

00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:19,309
is probably the first thing that I've

00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:21,799
always started so with with that if I am

00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:24,619
contributing to an open-source project

00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:26,659
and we are very actively using say a

00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:28,700
framework within the open-source

00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:30,590
community and we are finding problems

00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,389
with bugs

00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:35,779
or things that we'd like to do with it

00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:38,749
that maybe are extensions of it if we're

00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:39,619
able to contribute those things back to

00:20:38,749 --> 00:20:42,470
the community

00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:45,919
those things get maintained by other

00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:48,320
people or it means we don't have to

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,259
maintain them or internally of those

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,559
features so they're not critical IP that

00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:57,950
we're saying are differentiators of us

00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:59,989
there is a cost benefit for me putting

00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:02,899
that out or other we will see other

00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:06,679
people's painting I essentially get

00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:11,629
additional workers to help me with my my

00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:14,419
source code influences the next analyst

00:21:11,629 --> 00:21:17,119
so when we think about you know a

00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:19,389
company investing in to be some software

00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:21,950
whether it be open sorcery proprietary

00:21:19,389 --> 00:21:25,340
if they're gonna put a lot of a lot of

00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:27,409
their business future unmet stack they

00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:29,779
want to have some type of statement have

00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:31,759
some way of influencing their lungs and

00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:34,759
direction of them with whether it be

00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:36,679
contractually the branches software but

00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:38,179
much better options with open source

00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:41,269
software where if you can actually

00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:43,159
contribute back so instead of making you

00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:45,739
know something vendor will you please

00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:49,249
implement this function for me I realize

00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:53,269
marry your top laner knee but because we

00:21:49,249 --> 00:21:56,749
need it rolling resource names for court

00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:58,879
there was three kiloton scenario you get

00:21:56,749 --> 00:22:02,389
to influence that stuffing and a lot of

00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:04,429
these situations you know company may

00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:06,769
eat something is the top priority for

00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:09,270
the current leaders but much like

00:22:06,769 --> 00:22:11,550
contributing back you get

00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:13,920
it's say well where don't work just

00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:16,650
three will accept the committee and I

00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,670
think you've already done the work you

00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:22,260
would probably going to be they're going

00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:24,840
to be able to submit a bill talking yeah

00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:27,000
finally recruiting it's one of those

00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:31,230
things is a dirty word with you if

00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,480
you're developer however talking about

00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:36,540
it from the company's perspective and

00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:40,380
we'll talk about the individual aspects

00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:42,780
later but being involved people knowing

00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:45,870
your companies involved if open source

00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:48,600
can be a great niche to development

00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:51,330
because developers then know that the

00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,310
code that they're writing is going to be

00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:55,110
viewable by the rest of the world

00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:59,730
they're going to be able to kind of show

00:22:55,110 --> 00:23:03,390
off their skills recruiting needs

00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:05,370
opening up the town you see that commits

00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:07,320
on a certain project are coming from a

00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:08,910
certain company is a way to broadcast

00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,580
save your company's using that

00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:14,790
technology people that hate using that

00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:16,770
technology maybe draw your compass free

00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:19,590
advertise there are folks may answer

00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:22,140
that use their company emails or there

00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:24,240
commence on those two minutes people see

00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:27,060
those company names company across it is

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:33,960
a branding opportunity to some of the

00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:37,350
best talent to the world business which

00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:39,060
brings us a individual events so those

00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:41,130
are the reasons for a company you want

00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,570
to be involved but let's like yourselves

00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:47,160
like companies don't write code people

00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:49,220
so why do we as developers and frankly

00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:52,110
the first thing I think of a street cred

00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:56,730
you know they walk into any one of these

00:23:52,110 --> 00:24:00,000
conferences say a commuter on spring

00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:01,710
bench I'm a PM specialist I am you know

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:08,910
a commander on this project for that

00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:11,130
project there's like you don't

00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:15,000
understand how big a deal is walk in the

00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:17,550
room work done girl that is waiting that

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,110
coat people's eyes or not they really

00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:21,110
pay attention to what I say

00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:27,450
another example that is accepted for my

00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:29,010
current position right now where I was

00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,850
interviewing to take over the spring

00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,710
match project

00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:34,410
I haven't any technical interview since

00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:36,200
I got booked open-source it all been

00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:38,070
like if I really want to know your tech

00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,530
we're talking pennies I'll read your

00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:45,300
books or your code online it's

00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:45,980
simplified several processes the second

00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,870
piece

00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,730
it's kind of counterintuitive to not

00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:53,580
only see it because a lot of times when

00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:57,330
we write code or an open-source project

00:24:53,580 --> 00:25:02,460
we submit that PR doesn't automatically

00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:05,280
just get hurt right often it comes back

00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:07,770
with feedback so somebody they took the

00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:11,760
time to write things about why my code

00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:15,000
is shipped to me there's a spin on that

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,860
so you're what that is is that may be

00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,600
taking this criticism which is beautiful

00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:22,200
a lot of us don't like being criticized

00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:24,540
it's also a mentorship the way I look at

00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,750
feedback Rebekah's a gift the most

00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:31,080
recent these this person is trying to

00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:33,000
help you right to word this project and

00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,280
you may not be aware of all the things

00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,290
going on with that project you may not

00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,290
be aware of the Styles you may not be

00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:42,150
aware of these things in your code you

00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:44,490
didn't realize that you wrote that hey

00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:47,460
this is actually an officially greatest

00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:49,650
like this more efficient you can learn

00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:55,950
things from these interactions with open

00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:58,260
source so a lot of the down sides of

00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:59,910
open source come out of hey I'm trying

00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,920
to get this community and this person to

00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:04,650
fight me on this because they're a

00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,000
terrible person that doesn't happen

00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,830
every once in a while those are the

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,080
things that get a lot of publicity but

00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:12,660
what it's understated is the amount of

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,460
time that feedback is genuine and coming

00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,230
from a big place where somebody's trying

00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,970
to make you look better - Oliver

00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:20,550
or maybe he's trying to provide coaching

00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:23,910
to you that is going to help you down

00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:25,650
one they cannot I cannot count the

00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:28,380
number of times where I submitted PRS

00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:30,840
and I got feedback and said yeah this is

00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,790
a good idea this is good but can you do

00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,820
this this and this may be better if you

00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:36,669
tried this

00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,019
and those conversations help build those

00:26:36,669 --> 00:26:39,489
personal relationships with those

00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:42,940
communities personal relationships

00:26:39,489 --> 00:26:45,190
people on projects and exposes you to

00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:49,239
some mentorship opportunities you would

00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:50,950
not otherwise have a lot of us we get to

00:26:49,239 --> 00:26:54,309
a point or companies where there's not a

00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:57,249
lot of criticism of our work anymore

00:26:54,309 --> 00:26:59,019
being involved in open source those next

00:26:57,249 --> 00:27:01,720
worship opportunities where people are

00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:02,739
maybe the top person in that field

00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,059
they've been doing

00:27:02,739 --> 00:27:06,729
they've been we're going to learn a

00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:09,879
narrow range of problems for a very long

00:27:06,729 --> 00:27:17,830
time there's there's coaching you can't

00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:21,129
get along with that it's you world is a

00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:22,559
global world right we are software that

00:27:21,129 --> 00:27:25,419
is developed literally around the world

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:28,409
they can start your network uses that

00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:32,169
best if you learn to be an open source

00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:34,210
because you're sitting at best most part

00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:36,129
might be the occasional one or two

00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:39,549
people at a conference you can go to

00:27:36,129 --> 00:27:44,129
conferences whereas with open source

00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:48,489
you're getting feedback interactions

00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:50,950
that isn't just from the conversation

00:27:48,489 --> 00:27:52,950
that kind of opportunities around the

00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:54,609
world it's just something speaking

00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:56,080
there's a lot of international

00:27:54,609 --> 00:27:59,259
conferences we can't get into most

00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,580
conferences less or no become known like

00:27:59,259 --> 00:28:02,429
contributing to people that aren't

00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:05,349
working those projects around the world

00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:09,340
all of that networking that happens

00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:12,299
mainly with issues or requests is like

00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:15,519
that do you build a rapport with these

00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:18,820
it's actually really cool to see then

00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:21,159
reporting because you'll be working on a

00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,659
project with a problem going back and

00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:23,919
forth to somebody attention for weeks

00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:27,070
maybe months

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,899
and then it'll get committed you know

00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:33,429
sort of gone through six months later

00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:36,070
this is the person working with for a

00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:37,690
first time in person it's like it's like

00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:40,710
seeing a new friend for the first time

00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:43,119
when it's this is the cool thing

00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:45,099
hug each other like each other and some

00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:46,250
person something just had been through

00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:50,059
hell and back

00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:52,340
initially I'm like there's no other way

00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:56,450
to get back into networking I'll say

00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:59,120
what are some work alright so hopefully

00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:00,980
we've given you some incentive why this

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,799
is personally beneficial to you I just

00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:06,289
beneficial to your companies so the next

00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:10,820
logical thing is okay what do I need to

00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:13,220
do to get started in this and first

00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:15,230
choice is to figure out like well we're

00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:17,390
going spending my time so we're trying

00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:18,890
to decide on a project there's a couple

00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:21,289
of different ways of doing it Michael

00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:24,320
actually kind of different on this you

00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:26,059
know Mike my take on it is I usually try

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,100
to pick a project that's safe that I

00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:30,860
know about that maybe I've been working

00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,750
with in my company already and just

00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:35,710
start going out to materialist just

00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:40,070
saying what's what's available to you

00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:42,110
you know and that is one way to get or

00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:45,289
beeping the project where it's kind of

00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:48,500
settled community to start with much

00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:50,090
more controlled environment maybe but

00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:53,169
you know I'll let Michael explain I need

00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:53,169
to set a little different perspective

00:29:53,320 --> 00:30:03,400
yeah so think of eight points I think

00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:06,500
there's something it's kind of like

00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:15,020
starting a business right business was

00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:30,409
something that wasn't yours I also look

00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:33,620
into it yeah we've obviously so what you

00:30:30,409 --> 00:30:43,130
continue so as it turns out there's a

00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:45,470
lot more non-code contributions so one

00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:50,480
of the first things that's obvious but

00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:52,549
is obvious because if there comes the

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,909
beans on the website the tutorial

00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:58,759
examples blog posts things that are

00:30:55,909 --> 00:31:02,959
written books things that are written

00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:05,599
or maybe even podcast content is king

00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:07,070
and advocating for your project and

00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:10,070
getting these projects out here and

00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:13,009
being beginner and you Peter you have

00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:15,349
brand new eyes looking and that is super

00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:17,629
valuable to the poster and work on these

00:31:15,349 --> 00:31:21,019
frameworks three years and no longer

00:31:17,629 --> 00:31:23,929
know what's this is actually how I make

00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:26,979
it better focus source I start using

00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:30,519
screen matching a company Aristotle

00:31:26,979 --> 00:31:32,599
thinks or a book out right looks like

00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:35,299
there wasn't one out there so I want to

00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:47,449
look at that's opened up the world to me

00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:49,759
to that time next we believe tribute

00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:52,549
those be a support that overflow the

00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:55,129
questions donates themselves in the

00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:59,169
abilities for the community to go we and

00:31:55,129 --> 00:32:01,429
answer those questions that come out the

00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:04,039
underlying communities the teams that

00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:06,319
run the software project is invaluable

00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:08,779
whether it be directly via something

00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:11,269
like Stack Overflow or different slack

00:32:08,779 --> 00:32:15,649
in Gator and all those different I am

00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:18,859
based options providing support in the

00:32:15,649 --> 00:32:21,169
community is a huge there's the teams

00:32:18,859 --> 00:32:23,389
that Frankie's break this open source

00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:26,119
software let's be honest lyrics talents

00:32:23,389 --> 00:32:28,339
usually pretty small team and a lot of

00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:31,329
cases question every eventually imagine

00:32:28,339 --> 00:32:33,469
second things it's volunteer this is all

00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:35,719
after hours there could be case with a

00:32:33,469 --> 00:32:38,799
bank kind of thing so being able to

00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:43,219
provide that kind of support to be

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:45,649
honest and to be fair some people aren't

00:32:43,219 --> 00:32:48,979
paid for their pets but it does come

00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:50,959
through the things that BASF is

00:32:48,979 --> 00:32:54,589
everything that you do through an action

00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:56,419
is done as an individual rather than for

00:32:54,589 --> 00:33:01,909
your for your comings whether you get

00:32:56,419 --> 00:33:04,549
eight so there are these kind of

00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:06,259
economics are evolving there are a lot

00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:07,279
of folks that actually give the page by

00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:09,469
open source software

00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:12,210
even with an Apache outside of the court

00:33:09,469 --> 00:33:13,950
appointments and

00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:17,100
last and most obvious thing is probably

00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:18,810
you can write both the less obvious

00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,430
thing is but there's lots of different

00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:22,740
types of code you can write you can

00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:25,500
write tutorial based code to certain

00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:29,040
examples of usage there is less coverage

00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:30,840
which most projects some projects do

00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,880
better than others

00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,010
contributing test coverage is his

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,540
contribution and counts all the same as

00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:38,970
writing code from the pension project

00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:41,670
and then finally the actual main line

00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:47,670
code that is within the library or

00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:51,660
framework or whatever so how do you get

00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:54,390
started so understand why do you

00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:56,580
understand maybe what may or may not

00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:59,010
want to do so what's the actual

00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:01,500
mechanism for doing this step one is

00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:03,050
communication so in a distributed

00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:06,150
environment of any kind

00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:11,010
communication is key / communications

00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:12,870
and so in this case going to get up

00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:14,490
issues and finding whatever the

00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:16,130
framework you're interested in finding

00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:19,080
the most complex or the oldest issue

00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:23,850
they are ranking out some solutions

00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:25,680
maybe are probably isn't probably he's

00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:27,870
not going to anyway thank you for that

00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:33,540
wonderful time you get a community is so

00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:35,310
smart because this is this this is wrong

00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:38,940
and really want to do that anyways for

00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:41,970
some reasons to talk to the community

00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:43,620
talk to those that do maintain if you

00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:45,420
are interested in addition to ask I'm

00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:47,730
interested in this issue this is what

00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:50,240
I'm thinking about you know am i under

00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:54,180
right now in the community should

00:34:50,240 --> 00:35:01,650
responsible one project or respond back

00:34:54,180 --> 00:35:03,660
and iterate or actually yeah within

00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:05,730
actually a lot of that just involves the

00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,710
first step is always joining families

00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:09,300
whether that's the dead mailing list or

00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:11,310
users mailing list depending on what

00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:16,140
type of contribution those things are

00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:18,330
open to join those it just starts

00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:21,690
getting integrated and allows you to see

00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:23,340
was it worth the people are talking

00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:24,870
about go see what's important see what's

00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:26,880
actively being worked

00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:30,420
something that may be able to carry out

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:34,380
there looking to decide what you want to

00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:36,990
do the next step is creating a catch and

00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:42,180
as Michael alluded to earlier creating a

00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:44,820
patch with 16 to 30 open files and three

00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:47,040
thousand lines of code is probably not

00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,910
the best starting point for somebody in

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,640
dispute

00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:52,770
they don't know you know so being able

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,930
to introduce and say hey on the list I'm

00:35:52,770 --> 00:36:00,180
looking at working contacts do you think

00:35:54,930 --> 00:36:01,740
you know whether it be maybe with a

00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:04,860
story but starting that conversation

00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:07,680
with or offering a contribution can help

00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:11,310
once you offer the contribution starting

00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,890
in small steps as small PRS is going to

00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:16,980
help you get have a higher likelihood of

00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:19,500
getting that we are integrated into the

00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:21,690
system that are trying to contribute and

00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:24,540
here's the funny thing and the trick to

00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:26,730
this is breaking your contribution may

00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:28,650
have this big idea in their head but if

00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:31,470
you can break that down into small parts

00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:33,690
and contribute small parts frequently

00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:35,730
you are more likely to become a

00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:38,790
committer on that project because small

00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:39,690
frequent commits are exactly what the

00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:42,000
PMC's

00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:45,270
and the committers are looking for you

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,950
to do to save this person's project so

00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:49,020
don't need a big point you know it's all

00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:51,030
in your head at once one get out is he

00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:54,780
liked what I did break it up into small

00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:57,720
digestible pieces it gives you the

00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:59,940
status you want and it can it can get

00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,070
you more authority with the program with

00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:09,080
international quickly then trying to do

00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:11,550
a bleep thing once you just make that PR

00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:16,800
catch my next step is feedback

00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:22,250
talked about this earlier on but just as

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:24,960
an example of just this great team I

00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:27,420
tell them that we're making each other

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,780
were each each other's code and that's

00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:34,160
really how this is anything that can

00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:37,160
receive snap that's keepers there's no

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,160
started

00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:44,619
you literally is and I make I don't want

00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:47,170
my project to be the best it could be

00:37:44,619 --> 00:37:50,319
they might write me back that is what I

00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:52,480
feel that repeats to make it act now is

00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:53,740
a bi-directional Street there's no one

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,910
with you coming back you're like well

00:37:53,740 --> 00:38:02,650
what about this this it is the mutation

00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:05,650
is little more corrections that is for

00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:10,690
the person for mining is saying here man

00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:13,420
development probably examples which

00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:15,839
speak English a brief we're not edited

00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:18,069
we're eating with open-source commuters

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,690
there's a few different things that may

00:38:18,069 --> 00:38:21,700
not be intuitive when you're sending

00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:24,819
some of those first communications to a

00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:28,030
list that you should do or talk again

00:38:24,819 --> 00:38:29,980
remembering but most do not know but

00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:32,109
also remember that you're potentially

00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:34,920
dealing with an international audience

00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:37,809
so you're they're muttons and your

00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:40,000
diagnosis and things that you think may

00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:41,319
be taken in a very different context

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,680
with people in different parts of the

00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,809
world

00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,400
so it's best even though you may want to

00:38:43,809 --> 00:38:49,240
try to get continued to leave those

00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:51,010
things leaving those things out people

00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:54,099
may not be interested in your entire

00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:56,980
life story in the very first message

00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:59,140
that you send to report keeping things

00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:01,210
very short and concise if you can use

00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:03,460
one sentence to say what you might see

00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:05,710
in three sentences do the one cent

00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:09,359
because the amount of eyeballs on that

00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:12,130
message fifty thirty it could be 200 and

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:15,190
the folks their votes I project it will

00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:17,260
read it it's your life thirty they may

00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:19,480
not read an email from you again it

00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:23,049
would join some sort of a filter so

00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:25,270
being short concise aware of cultural

00:39:23,049 --> 00:39:27,339
norms that may exist in your culture

00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:29,470
that may not exist and others and just

00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:31,799
getting straight to the point is what

00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:39,579
you want to do and working with these

00:39:31,799 --> 00:39:41,619
communities so what can happen you know

00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:44,170
if you do contribute open-source so a

00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:46,000
lot of this has been about outcomes and

00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:49,000
you know for myself personally I got

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,580
involved in open source you know

00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:56,030
probably about six or seven years

00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:59,150
without getting involved I did it with

00:39:56,030 --> 00:40:00,770
with a money money and from going from

00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:04,280
contributing just a little bit it

00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:06,290
becomes one of those things that and the

00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,420
more you do before you learn about the

00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:10,730
project you're working on and the more
