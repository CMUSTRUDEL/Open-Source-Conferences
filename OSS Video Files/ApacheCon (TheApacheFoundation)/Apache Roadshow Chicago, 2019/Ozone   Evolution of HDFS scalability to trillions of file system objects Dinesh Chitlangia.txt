Title: Ozone   Evolution of HDFS scalability to trillions of file system objects Dinesh Chitlangia
Publication date: 2019-06-20
Playlist: Apache Roadshow Chicago, 2019
Description: 
	Apache Hadoop Ozone is a robust, distributed key-value object store for Hadoop with layered architecture and strong consistency. It separates the namespace management from block and node management layer, which allows users to independently scale on both axes. Ozone is interoperable with Hadoop ecosystem as it provides OzoneFS (Hadoop compatible file system API), data locality and plug-n-play deployment with HDFS as it can be installed in an existing Hadoop cluster and can share storage disks with HDFS. Ozone solves the scalability challenges with HDFS by being size agnostic. Consequently, it allows users to store trillions of files in Ozone and access them as if they are on HDFS. Ozone plugs into existing Hadoop deployments seamlessly, and programs like MapReduce, Spark, Hive, Hive Interactive and work without any modifications. This presentation gives us an overview of Ozone and talks about the design, architecture, and future roadmap.

00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,799
[Music]

00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:49,399
so I only need two sheets per ounce so

00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,720
and see if I can just keep one around

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,720
Julie

00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,720
I

00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,739
[Music]

00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,360
[Music]

00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,020
[Music]

00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,930
[Applause]

00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:16,500
[Music]

00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:19,830
so but people are that's because we have

00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,830
an interesting

00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,340
[Music]

00:06:31,420 --> 00:07:56,660
so so so suppose but then people get you

00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:01,430
know who are pieces

00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:07,280
yeah it was just like and energy for

00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:09,700
humans - exactly so you know we've tried

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,950
for the last eight years

00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:16,270
you guys go to put small things with the

00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:24,440
same pattern but the people will not and

00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:27,410
usually you survive I use assistance so

00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,910
this is not rain we can completely

00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:34,330
building the scale first

00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:34,330
I stopped remove any effects so

00:08:44,800 --> 00:10:42,790
so so but in the movies so if you are

00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,790
infected my pocket

00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,710
[Music]

00:11:50,040 --> 00:12:48,910
so in those case of babies from the

00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:51,810
mostly good one it also allows us in

00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,810
this position

00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:01,239
[Music]

00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:12,520
so that's the now maybe since we have

00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:21,460
segregated

00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:33,910
the basis and the office for the first

00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:41,700
one so this is so stupid

00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:41,700
genius is completely spaced so

00:15:04,769 --> 00:17:02,610
so so and with all the

00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,819
[Music]

00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:24,259
[Music]

00:17:30,010 --> 00:19:08,780
so maybe folks who support it with the

00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:13,520
solution in a manager does not crack all

00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:16,900
the knots it just stops legal meaning he

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,900
can really be scared of

00:19:40,730 --> 00:21:02,720
so we can't afford sigh so gives us so

00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:23,429
imagine you have three managers

00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:26,720
three former managers talking to 1 St

00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:26,720
which I made

00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,869
[Music]

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,380
[Music]

00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:52,240
so this is

00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:55,220
already exist right so he can send me a

00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:58,220
 to the skinny asian space this one

00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,220
haha

00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:18,650
so the biggest situation so many recipes

00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:28,770
the typical example uses is in the

00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:33,230
number of files are not high but excuse

00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:37,140
me and this is a very common scenario

00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:41,580
your environment said writing class on

00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:44,490
living 132 distance on if you involved

00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:47,310
with through one in seven sisters so

00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:50,760
these are some cases where large by

00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:55,310
secular city PA disparities industrial

00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:55,310
tonight might happen we multiply X by

00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:02,100
Delta P region a huge number box so when

00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,490
you're drawing is not happening to be

00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,530
silly

00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:31,590
but instead each other knocks mr. so by

00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:39,060
this morning just so so this is what the

00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:41,550
night pot so you also believe this it is

00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:45,210
three or similar except agnostic so

00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:47,660
let's see what it is something a good

00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,660
thickness

00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:17,059
[Music]

00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,380
[Music]

00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:56,000
so this has a system which isn't the

00:27:52,309 --> 00:28:03,010
same shape but it so many questions

00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,010
because every tiny

00:28:17,080 --> 00:30:15,610
so in very she's just so again we both

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,610
was to make it ready and

00:30:23,710 --> 00:32:17,029
because it was but then candidate hdfs

00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:24,760
it was so nobody dies a very stable

00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:24,760
system by making so the aneurysm do not

00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:45,079
[Music]

00:32:56,530 --> 00:34:29,060
so so so so NPR you see because to

00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:30,470
recognize the coefficient gamma rays so

00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:35,470
things like locate yes

00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:35,470
so okay s degrees Jupiter system

00:35:26,810 --> 00:36:48,310
so this is not assisting people stops my

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:51,510
to system I mean so what if done is

00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:51,510
[Music]

00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:25,820
[Music]

00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:35,860
[Music]

00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:54,020
[Music]

00:38:55,130 --> 00:39:03,560
even if you have just internally

00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,560
assistant

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,770
[Music]

00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,830
so we also have

00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:15,530
[Music]

00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,880
so

00:43:33,970 --> 00:44:24,370
so this is so then we can't even fight

00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:30,020
design this thief is not a boss

00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:32,450
see the cumulative that particular

00:44:30,020 --> 00:45:05,710
interval was some between exactly what

00:44:32,450 --> 00:45:09,950
has us it's very easy because because he

00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:12,790
what did you close the community and all

00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:12,790
of the operation

00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:38,710
so yes yes so everything is he can also

00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:38,710
get you know that because

00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,809
[Music]

00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,980
the information

00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:36,980
