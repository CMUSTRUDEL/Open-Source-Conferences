Description: 
	Non-code contribution are the vital air of Open Source project, covering tasks that span from project to community management and advocacy, these contributions often times open the doors for non-tech contributors to develop a career in tech. How recognizing these contributions can help projects be more diverse? I'll be sharing best practices and recommendations to achieve this.

00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:27,689
traditions can be a road to diversity

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:32,130
so basically when I was writing this

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:34,050
talk and thought about what was dead I

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,200
will that I wanted to eat this

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:41,190
conversation in and decided to focus it

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,469
on how I just can't even open on called

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:53,870
contributions to become that wrote for

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:53,870
dinner so I'm a Googler which means to

00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:59,960
say I want you to see

00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:07,290
I create attorney was from old brakes

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:38,870
and especially what he was

00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:42,290
earlier in her top which is diversity so

00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:44,390
they only know this talk Oh intervention

00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,900
and I wanted to talk about not with the

00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:50,930
tribunes from the benefits that projects

00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,540
can happen and how this will enable them

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:56,870
to build more diversity so really we're

00:03:53,540 --> 00:04:09,349
having all the stuff so why do people

00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:11,780
should care so what is contribution then

00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:15,680
this cause how this helps that journey

00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:17,570
of users becoming contributors and then

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,630
I'm gonna have two suggestions for

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:24,470
projects into actually taking countries

00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:27,289
to label this and do geologists now asks

00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:34,789
you from my research and industry

00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:37,180
overall conversations you know maybe our

00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:45,460
questions that would be protected

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:45,460
discuss so defining no no contributions

00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:58,550
to terminus to the stop action fighting

00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:01,460
and traditions as different as teachers

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:04,310
of the co-production however is a

00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:08,419
different approach and defined two

00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:11,930
aspects of situations for exercise user

00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:15,169
support and business project going

00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:19,760
outwards to the people want to lead with

00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:23,120
the technology introductory use from

00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,710
management and it is purely the task of

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:30,099
keeping the project alive being

00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:30,099
efficient in getting management which is

00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,230
so some examples up to took these three

00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:41,930
groups so we use your support we have

00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:47,000
things such as documentation as many

00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:50,420
questions and red blue or black many

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,720
channels bring together training and so

00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:55,970
on so basically the user support know

00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,970
the contributions that anyone can be is

00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:02,240
a speaking of the project how many other

00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:04,850
users with questions whether the right

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,000
solution for the problem or if there is

00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:09,530
talking to implement the project or any

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,440
questions that they have about the

00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:15,430
community or the dynamics of the project

00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:20,060
it's basically having a twang of support

00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:30,440
in helping your project grow in

00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:33,830
community so we have things which this

00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,600
event recognizing contribution

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,490
contributors this is important because

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,130
one of the challenges that I'm going to

00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:42,980
discuss later on is you actually need

00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:46,100
eyes that are linking at the community

00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:49,810
to see who is being part of this

00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:52,880
consistent journey of helping Department

00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:55,730
have things like mentorship you just be

00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:03,080
super got to keep directly the loop of

00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:05,860
what's going on so a newsletter to the

00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:14,870
community has participant

00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:16,730
fundraising projects need also in a

00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,650
project management site so now we talk

00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:20,510
about a user side which is basically

00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:23,600
helping to present role to get I thought

00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:28,120
she get traction then you have community

00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,120
management which tell us two projects

00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:36,710
and then you have project management

00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:38,919
project management is undoubtedly a lot

00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:40,840
of the work that

00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:42,729
developers producing following into the

00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,340
projector hype to to what needs to get

00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:48,539
done and this is basically helping the

00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:52,270
project move from state a to state B in

00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:54,639
hte truce so the type of activities that

00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:57,520
are included here have to do with

00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:01,629
releases during fiash feature requests

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:14,819
Liege project road map testing Quality

00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:14,819
Assurance related directly to so it did

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:23,229
you have the warrant which is like

00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:27,490
helping users getting to the project you

00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:30,250
have the community but also the ability

00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:34,599
helps the production of the project so

00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:39,370
what is the value for the project and

00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:44,229
also earlier mentioned she's really

00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:47,980
putting the following numbers so it was

00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:49,870
I see two aspects of recognizing these

00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,779
type of contributions to your project

00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:56,620
the first one is do increase development

00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:59,110
the agility and development velocity by

00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,930
enabling morning hands to take an active

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:05,170
role in your project you are pretty much

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:08,290
about the main the bottleneck which just

00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:10,990
operate your project and at the same

00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:20,190
time you translate what you say cost of

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:20,190
three word or based education oldest

00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:31,029
every organization the second part of it

00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:34,230
is in the system growth and we find

00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:37,630
there because assistant realities

00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:40,149
opportunity for everyone if you give

00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:42,070
your project keeps on adding volume and

00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:44,949
having more functionalities port

00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,390
integrations better eruption there were

00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:48,490
too many that are tears of the

00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:51,000
partnership or the project for the

00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:55,090
individuals that

00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:03,190
homily polygroup

00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:43,900
so they say anyway is creating job

00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:48,750
opportunities so first of all how would

00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,750
you feeling it went to the lady in the

00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,909
[Applause]

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:09,220
Furious

00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:11,920
well why it is important for disorders

00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:16,230
basically it's very sensitive this

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:20,260
Bishop and university communities are

00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:26,050
intervening that she was trying to reach

00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:26,650
and in between herself to God it's very

00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:29,860
scary

00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:33,300
rich there's a rich there's a way that's

00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:35,680
very scary and it seems not very stable

00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:39,400
so in the presentation that would

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,270
prevent all well ii heard that no local

00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,450
in tribution

00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:45,820
I actually sometimes a way from people

00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:49,990
very interested in to project to test

00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:51,850
the waters or test the community so and

00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:55,980
we see how she's taken that first step

00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:59,140
that first step is actually it could be

00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:02,740
contribution that she's doing to see how

00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:08,339
safe perspective collected healthy

00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:11,440
predators so in that journey from

00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:14,140
usually point of view the perception of

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,390
safety is the bridge and the number

00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:19,120
contributions like those versus tax that

00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:21,190
the user stick to to inter community so

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,910
this is important and this is why you

00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:30,430
should care about how project recognize

00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:36,940
those situations so I wanted to share

00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:39,540
this just from happy would I serve it

00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,740
she shared an excitement of the first

00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:47,980
condition that she made to the party

00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:49,779
afloat and I lost like she she said my

00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,480
first five chambers will be honor was

00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:55,330
stripped it was a long leg of change and

00:12:52,480 --> 00:13:01,270
I couldn't be prouder that one cage it's

00:12:55,330 --> 00:13:07,180
so no one has to which took a long time

00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:09,880
to decide no condition is just that the

00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:28,180
reason that she suffered just a wide

00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:31,830
reach wasn't enough to just see the

00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:41,010
first phases from someone in you know

00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:49,779
maybe melody a recognition secret

00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:51,550
actually for many of the people from

00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:55,589
therefore community it was very very

00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,589
encouraging and it was nice to see

00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:06,150
so how the project is track dark rich

00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:06,150
that's the trigger condition

00:14:11,850 --> 00:15:42,910
early years ago so what Kenny very first

00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:46,390
project that I join network that I was

00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:48,339
doing on bringing together community

00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:56,649
bringing together the partners to

00:15:48,339 --> 00:16:17,570
discuss project organizing events it was

00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:20,089
doing it for my events into issues so

00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:22,940
me to say it was that early recognition

00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:24,170
and I was lucky enough to have folks

00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,839
from the community which are

00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:31,550
acknowledged what I was doing for the

00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:33,589
project they set the second

00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,639
recommendation that I have is where

00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:39,350
consistency so the recognition of early

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,240
participation is crucial so you can

00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:43,490
continue to motivate the spots where

00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:47,029
periods but there have not been the

00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:49,579
contents get to country if they have not

00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:52,519
been consistent if they change from

00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:55,579
making one my contribution to then take

00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:57,440
ownership of a whole section of the

00:16:55,579 --> 00:17:00,860
documentation that's when you need to

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:03,529
rework this dis contributions help them

00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:06,439
take you one step further until they can

00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:13,780
get to the beauty through project how do

00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:18,470
you do this you need to create to have a

00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:23,089
moment the expectations are or at least

00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:24,890
espouse how can you validate this not

00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:28,419
for them to follow and this is something

00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,419
that the research that I have done

00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:38,049
several foundations projects companies

00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:46,070
are interested in how different

00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:52,010
consistency contributions so what

00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:55,070
happens when you are recognizing you are

00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:57,140
know with a very large group in a large

00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:59,299
community and hopefully this is going to

00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:02,750
bring quality to the project which also

00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:04,880
makes to challenge which is now you're

00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:07,070
going to have competing up or

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:11,169
distributive community to buy the first

00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:14,480
array of those things for your project

00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:16,610
in such unnecessary you also need to

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:22,070
have a strong structure that supports

00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:25,630
that so curiously by empowering a

00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,630
network already

00:18:26,130 --> 00:19:38,760
I realize that by just numbers we

00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:42,780
support our community so this group of

00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:46,350
people are the bean summit there are

00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:50,400
also supporting present world because

00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:53,040
just this empowerment mission and given

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,410
them to continue to make positions

00:19:53,040 --> 00:20:05,250
around this position that they they just

00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:10,020
pop so most empowering it's very

00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:12,390
different to say company they're

00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:26,580
actually people to make decisions and

00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:28,950
helping others so three suggestions

00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:32,340
involved and Medical Foundation for

00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:37,280
chocolate rich is recognized early the

00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:37,280
right consistency and build and power

00:20:41,730 --> 00:22:49,750
now from one of the so this is because

00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:56,560
this is recreate

00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:59,260
not sure what we're doing and even

00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:04,050
though we can only see a small piece of

00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:06,670
desperate the in effort kind of scale in

00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:09,070
there's so much here and really of

00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:14,800
antennas just because what I mentioned

00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:22,740
earlier is that our eyes the better more

00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:22,740
successful so interesting as I have with

00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:28,750
Laura donor community talking about this

00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:34,030
this is one of the challenges that I

00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:37,060
work which is we create a network of

00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:39,730
mentors and just nominators that will

00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:43,210
pay attention to the newcomers in more

00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:46,300
frequent and just how was it because

00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:48,700
they chim to the suppose for interested

00:23:46,300 --> 00:24:01,470
but not speaking up it's a challenge and

00:23:48,700 --> 00:24:04,990
we can only do it they're actively so

00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:07,240
insurance until the number contributions

00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:10,000
are valued by increasing development

00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,670
that was a new project and also it will

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,710
steam project Polly growth so creating

00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:17,830
that a larger ecosystem for everybody to

00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:20,500
benefit from what contributions are one

00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:23,400
of the ways users taste safety or

00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:27,340
driving a project perct

00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:30,760
to me infrastructure to identify and

00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:33,550
recognize issues and these equals

00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:37,210
building building that safety that your

00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:39,790
gives me and actually will I have your

00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:42,490
own community to keep driving this word

00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:44,230
and the most immersive message here is

00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:46,780
that can be delivered this and being an

00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:49,500
advocate for doing it because it's how

00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:52,090
many will generate them are going to

00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:58,020
encase and fostered this there's

00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:58,020
recognitions so

00:25:15,290 --> 00:26:17,790
yes that is a reflection so the question

00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:23,070
was why didn't cover things like

00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:24,750
graphics UI and actually no I actually

00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:26,880
think it's a part of they just are

00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:29,940
management and it can be using

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:33,570
punishment punishment and anything use

00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:36,840
it just because I but I think it's a

00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:38,730
great point graphics and UX I will see

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,780
there are personally important to user

00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:49,640
management especially if it's from

00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:49,640
documentation information project

00:27:14,290 --> 00:29:09,170
yes so much meaning in a nutshell in

00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:10,149
Mexico because there and he was so

00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:12,189
impressed

00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:15,849
I was impressed by the fact that there's

00:29:12,189 --> 00:29:18,249
so much talent but they don't join to

00:29:15,849 --> 00:29:19,889
active development community of open

00:29:18,249 --> 00:29:22,179
source because of the language barrier

00:29:19,889 --> 00:29:25,119
so I think look at a station

00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:29,249
specifically it's oftentimes not

00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:31,959
considered and I'm all because I think

00:29:29,249 --> 00:29:38,529
looks really say that I applied it well

00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:42,009
in it struck me that not the total world

00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:42,909
speaks an interesting English kotas is

00:29:42,009 --> 00:29:45,849
very powerful

00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:48,519
so what really surprised me was it is

00:29:45,849 --> 00:29:50,589
interviewers they claim that they don't

00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:51,669
speak English but it's be cold and they

00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:55,029
understand :

00:29:51,669 --> 00:29:57,309
look what is professing contributing is

00:29:55,029 --> 00:30:01,269
not feeling comfortable interested in

00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:08,589
English so looking for how to engage

00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:13,389
those communities to me and just

00:30:08,589 --> 00:30:16,719
recently late forward we want a team and

00:30:13,389 --> 00:30:23,799
engage in that Jamie's just opening mail

00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:48,909
unless there was a Chinese in China I'm

00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:51,399
actually trying to get to so you might

00:30:48,909 --> 00:30:54,249
actually like have so many friends that

00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:56,529
have one sakura-san actually going and

00:30:54,249 --> 00:30:59,709
talking to their life I was literally

00:30:56,529 --> 00:31:03,119
there there validated to open source

00:30:59,709 --> 00:31:07,629
this dynamic space with you taking

00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:10,359
anybody go and that actually is very

00:31:07,629 --> 00:31:13,029
very effective planet for example I have

00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:16,869
you as a designer that gives you a

00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:19,779
designer friend who has a new job and he

00:31:16,869 --> 00:31:21,040
still not companies like I tried to get

00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:32,090
him to country

00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:34,400
and then you can find a job in the

00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:37,400
United States and moving and doing that

00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:41,060
sourcing like going and asking for

00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:44,480
contribution my is very effective like

00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:48,070
anyway when we talk of attracting a

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:50,300
traditional source for example a basic

00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:54,160
documentation contribution

00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:58,100
it doesn't help much telling them this

00:31:54,160 --> 00:32:01,450
here are specific to the dishes that we

00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,450
