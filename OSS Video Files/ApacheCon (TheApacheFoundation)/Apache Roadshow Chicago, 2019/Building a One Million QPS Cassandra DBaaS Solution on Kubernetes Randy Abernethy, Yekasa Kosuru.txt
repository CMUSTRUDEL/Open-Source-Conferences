Description: 
	In 2018, State Street began using Kubernetes to increase velocity for their software pipeline and to improve developer experience and productivity. However, a production microservices platform is not complete without a highly scalable state management solution. To this end, State Street adopted Apache Cassandra as one of its key platform database offerings, enabling developers to avail themselves of the low latency and extreme scalability offered by Cassandra. In this talk, Yekasa and Randy will discuss the architecture of the Kubernetes-based Cassandra solution deployed at State Street. They will share their experiences, challenges and plans for the future, while also detailing the benefits the solution has delivered to the various teams working on the platform at one of the worldâ€™s largest financial institutions.
