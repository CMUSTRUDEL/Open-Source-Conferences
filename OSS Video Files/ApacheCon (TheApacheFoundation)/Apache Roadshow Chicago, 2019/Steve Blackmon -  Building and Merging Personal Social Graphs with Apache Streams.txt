Title: Steve Blackmon -  Building and Merging Personal Social Graphs with Apache Streams
Publication date: 2019-06-06
Playlist: Apache Roadshow Chicago, 2019
Description: 
	Apache Streams unifies a diverse world of digital profiles and online activities into common formats and vocabularies, primarily the Activity Streams 2.0 RDF syntax adopted by W3C. Users can process the archive files they download from apple, google, twitter, instagram, facebook, and more into structured graph data and load them into any RDF Triple Store. Additionally social graphs from multiple persons can be merged and examined together. This talk will describe how this process works and demonstrate how to do this with your own data, and pool your data with your friends, family, and colleagues.
