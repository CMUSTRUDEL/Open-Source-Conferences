Title: Implementing Dynamically Controlled Stream Pattern Boris Lublinsky
Publication date: 2019-07-08
Playlist: Apache Roadshow Chicago, 2019
Description: 
	A common problem in building streaming application is integration of stream processing systems with other data existing in an enterprise in the form of enterprise services. Traditional approaches to this problem use RPC-based service invocations from within stream processing. The advantages of such an approach are: - Simple integration with existing technologies and organizational processes - Easier to understand if you come from a non-streaming world On another hand, such an approach can suffer from the following drawbacks: - Worse latency, due to remote calls instead of local function calls - Coupling the availability, scalability, and latency/throughput of your streaming application with the SLAs of the RPC interface An alternative that I will cover is to use stateful stream processing, with the ability to update the state dynamically as the state of the services changes â€“ i.e., dynamically controlled streams. I will explain a pattern and show how to implement it using different technologies, including Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Akka Streams and Apache Kafka

so I just wanted to remind you all that

00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:13,110
the factory is I spawn here competences

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:16,500
we have events so help yourselves

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:19,010
we can't be this early sign of course a

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,740
PT or that even purchased your questions

00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:25,289
that's a choice it's definitely getting

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:29,730
on here at Y so it's battle fatigue

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:34,800
issues I had mentioned that in fact

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:36,899
waited doing this sort of establishments

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,980
is that we have to in order to get the

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:45,000
space by a black rhythms we actually

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:48,329
simply agreed on fixed number so

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,850
actually every 30 wa purchases actually

00:00:48,329 --> 00:01:00,320
a donation to the initiative foundation

00:00:50,850 --> 00:01:00,320
that's no way to go beyond that we were

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,119
just registered all you need to know is

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,130
your keys implement this is something

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,490
that can probably buy the wine new

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,650
projects looks like under the keys plan

00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:22,140
so we can wait to submit your later

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,240
grant what will is what's change

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:29,159
consumer paper or the leash take on

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:32,700
piece of paper where this was given a

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,530
URL all the keys design we do this at

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,420
your own convenience at another time Oh

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:40,020
at least these are involved in this

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:44,430
process up for the day it's me so if you

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:49,799
like registers partners bestow to us

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:54,720
that was insane Don attention org slash

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:57,780
son associate novel lower case so thank

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:02,399
you very much for again today we like to

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:05,960
ECU divorce would ski and we're going

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,960
away about student acts

00:02:24,770 --> 00:04:09,500
is because on the live with C so it's

00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:25,830
 two years people still

00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:29,700
is the biggest problem this is of course

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:38,910
our equipments because for every item on

00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:42,890
the other mcdowell murthy Collins is

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:52,890
going to 12 in that marks maybe they're

00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:58,890
doing something else so it's very in

00:04:52,890 --> 00:05:11,210
solution for this proposal to do a

00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:11,210
little bit where but this becomes

00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:43,160
basically minions they're just the

00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:56,100
computation and here are some references

00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:59,670
to it's published it was first published

00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:05,130
by three but you can find references in

00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:09,120
sparked the same time so the phone is

00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:11,540
ready to be implemented you have to do

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,450
look perfect execution

00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:18,290
what does this mean look at this picture

00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,290
but there's a free man

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:40,100
it's definitely my day going and the

00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:43,610
pressure is not what is not so them very

00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:47,450
much because it looks like is the what

00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:50,900
is completely different because I'm in

00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:56,000
the case of is here you know using

00:06:50,900 --> 00:07:02,030
service was is reduce interceptor for

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:06,850
cool video service I in the look simply

00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:13,430
execution architecture it's more like

00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:18,140
white board member so all the day is to

00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:23,420
the set of goals in who uses you know

00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:26,540
here who useful is this data we have no

00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:29,120
idea of people are going to use this

00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:36,020
data users a painting

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:50,330
teams and business colleges when people

00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:52,150
look at this are yes Rebecca who lives

00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:56,470
here

00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:56,470
restart why this view implementations

00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:14,510
but this is bullets if they are actually

00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:18,710
correct because the same way you're

00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:23,990
reading files in natively they are

00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:29,590
becoming in fact the emails they don't

00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:29,590
hate both your enterprise so

00:08:34,520 --> 00:10:21,950
so you hear the screams

00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:25,370
so a lot of people that they use in

00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:28,220
Korea ask the question with anybody

00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:30,380
using cognitive status fields business

00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:39,140
can see the huge misconception because

00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:49,540
yes cousins they produced by the same

00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:49,540
company but in a maybe

00:10:50,240 --> 00:11:18,020
I will show you about inspire here so

00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:20,150
example everything is you get in the

00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:25,760
shower to academic and out every

00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:53,600
Wednesday is we pass this unit support

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:57,470
voltage to music with year so this is we

00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:02,210
can look with innovation I apologize in

00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:08,089
advance I'm using IntelliJ sir formed

00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:29,890
this kind of smallish hopefully UTM some

00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:33,800
would see it but yeah if you are

00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:39,110
interesting the project is for pandemic

00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:41,810
we control three MCM is source even from

00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:46,820
my grandpa here you can take the

00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:49,270
presentation itself so it's fairly

00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,270
simple

00:13:49,800 --> 00:15:12,010
so you can see distance so it will be

00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:16,500
part of it it also is a contrarian which

00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:16,500
is which

00:15:43,200 --> 00:17:02,160
because it's in consumer producer

00:16:46,840 --> 00:17:07,270
this is what people are saying so also

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:10,780
solution so what is happening is you see

00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:14,860
this little barrel that is going back to

00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:20,050
the producer losing I can be more

00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:23,260
curious part for me alert in nature so

00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:29,850
basically a reactive speed because guild

00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:29,850
in control 495 if it ends tomorrow

00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:30,230
which is only to realize the arms later

00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:40,190
so appetite it's to be displaced is not

00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:40,190
know quite frankly but

00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:49,830
all of the messages from in a lot of

00:19:47,130 --> 00:20:13,860
cases people as the petition would give

00:19:49,830 --> 00:20:24,809
my honest what is that so you have so

00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:28,549
with this in place so instead after a

00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:34,110
self the class is now called behavior

00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:49,140
but in general if you did is before it

00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:56,390
was pretty much the same so Q in

00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:56,390
processing so enough of the area that's

00:20:56,419 --> 00:21:06,780
so weak down but we see the control was

00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:13,220
45 degree and something get something

00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:13,220
wrong we're not control so let's run

00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:32,159
because they

00:23:36,760 --> 00:24:10,450
in 1524 issuance there's to me but this

00:23:45,250 --> 00:24:24,429
is linear this so one thing to keep in

00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:30,160
mind because there is research - but not

00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:36,309
on the time on your own - so when you

00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:40,179
focus on your topic but partitioning is

00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:49,799
the main mechanism for us scaling

00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:49,799
because every partition in single

00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:12,240
resiliency is important thing from this

00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:40,740
is unique because so supervision sounds

00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:44,679
so in the hierarchy this one kills him

00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:48,090
away but here is fancy

00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:48,090
- we got this

00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:56,890
so security is denied here are made of

00:25:54,159 --> 00:26:01,510
the sphere is an extremely important

00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:05,080
speakers root beer you can scale things

00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:16,720
up with them but you immediate scenes

00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:17,740
will start going come on and this is the

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,149
best thing ever

00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:28,380
Rudyard Moon COAS given emphasis in

00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:28,380
future the captain Tosen will deployers

00:26:29,039 --> 00:27:04,590
push for the execution of the megalithic

00:26:58,779 --> 00:27:14,679
temples so I is the implementation

00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:17,320
especially else weapon system you might

00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:22,179
consider using something heinous or

00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:25,390
another my feelings is when fire gave

00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:27,990
information ability of the scenes so

00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:31,059
that disease is a lot

00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:32,590
morning bells and whistles that they

00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:37,480
used for the same person

00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:40,450
like we do in movies with the things are

00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:43,450
considered stable in our industry

00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:54,309
processing so consuming stays pretty

00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:56,200
good news so balancing is also where is

00:27:54,309 --> 00:28:04,859
Marcus

00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:04,859
it's exactly the same because its

00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:29,159
limitations

00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:35,519
you can run as many so this is the

00:28:29,159 --> 00:29:01,169
application so this is interesting

00:28:35,519 --> 00:29:01,169
so would exactly is it something that

00:29:02,249 --> 00:29:11,559
because if you know I mean they places

00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:14,109
visitors will see table below 80

00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:16,960
actually its place because when America

00:29:14,109 --> 00:29:23,249
database direct the world which is

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:29,499
receiving even gets the base table so a

00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:32,529
table that is implemented in country

00:29:29,499 --> 00:29:36,029
streams support read minds the same

00:29:32,529 --> 00:29:39,850
paradigm so it's the cumulative mode

00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:40,389
where you can use anything for given

00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:46,749
years

00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:53,619
anything for whatever it is all gold but

00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:54,970
it's like my first of all which is both

00:29:53,619 --> 00:30:01,590
blessing

00:29:54,970 --> 00:30:06,129
keepers instant Lexington the Syrians is

00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:09,210
no particular Cheney goes down what if

00:30:06,129 --> 00:30:13,260
you miss dealer if your

00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:17,670
the business apart then they come to

00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:25,950
believe is my change people yes so what

00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:36,810
is happening from so from this point of

00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:40,430
view is absolutely which is even was

00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:43,920
mining for three days and the date was

00:30:40,430 --> 00:31:07,890
updated million Tuckman's yes what is

00:30:43,920 --> 00:31:16,160
going to happen so so let's be in switch

00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:23,420
to the code people look at this

00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:29,720
implementation we can see it was

00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:29,720
behaving so it was going in

00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:57,620
there was music in that game here so it

00:31:48,910 --> 00:32:00,050
realizes this and love is going up and

00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:03,980
down it's poverty log for the one degree

00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:09,980
instead will exhibit that disease

00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:13,730
different you can take astonishing one

00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:19,900
thing that I haven't shown to you which

00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:24,760
also meridian of interest is so

00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:28,880
innovation itself roots life which is

00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:48,080
surprisingly simple because the three

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:51,920
days is so if you design them as if you

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:57,910
look here clear on basic weird to grabs

00:32:51,920 --> 00:33:03,680
one graph is for the new control data

00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:13,730
and it's very symbolic we invoke the

00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:19,010
actor and it doesn't need any more would

00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:23,450
actually it gets the Condors denotes the

00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:32,150
same actor and then I a little bit more

00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:43,000
logics every time the Institute so in

00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:43,000
this let's look it swims in days

00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:25,050
so the basic implementation is here in

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:25,050
if we look at the little waist let's say

00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:35,500
bicycle thing looking on started so that

00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:38,760
Putin's here how it is behaving things

00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,760
which do something else

00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:53,320
um this is actually the interesting

00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:56,200
thing is when you start at least we can

00:34:53,320 --> 00:35:01,090
ask to Soviet technology

00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:05,220
he basically reinsert the field so it

00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:05,220
kind of gets people

00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:25,529
so the same thing when you think of

00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:44,869
itself doesn't get superior somebody

00:35:25,529 --> 00:35:53,329
goes in dignity support so so I know

00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:53,329
this so open source in bruxing anthem

00:35:53,650 --> 00:36:06,359
[Music]

00:35:55,970 --> 00:36:10,880
multiple chip state support which is

00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:43,940
very admires in it also provides

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:43,940
business amendments because orientation

00:36:52,670 --> 00:37:07,579
so of course types and it also supports

00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:24,599
so that's actually quite simple if the

00:37:20,549 --> 00:37:26,779
key is distribution is given always we

00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:26,779
use

00:38:07,630 --> 00:39:09,640
so far

00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:25,430
spark is the interesting so far the

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:32,500
system but more we're using spark the

00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:32,500
more we're realizing what is perhaps

00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:37,000
training germs

00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:45,540
so what do you do in spark structures

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:50,370
gaming news the latest and greatest

00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:58,980
thing which means that everything is see

00:39:50,370 --> 00:40:02,360
both ways we supposed so the way it is

00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:07,190
is like this it's finished from the same

00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:11,520
table analogy so it's the stream

00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:18,660
propagates the table starts the business

00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:27,980
part it's here also there gives their

00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:27,980
partner to sew a staple in spark is

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:41,480
slice but the basic idea is smart is

00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:47,900
smart evening this evening

00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:52,820
this ability is that in Rimini beige is

00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:52,820
in executor which means there

00:40:54,350 --> 00:41:07,290
so because of this they've introduced

00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:13,860
when we stay group estate something like

00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:16,170
this where the state is stored extended

00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:22,470
from the executor and then push to the

00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:24,720
executor for a great series so I can

00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:27,900
show you the code but in this particular

00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:31,200
case I will choose not to because there

00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:35,550
is a there isn't me

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:38,400
so it's for extractive screaming - I

00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:41,700
need both continuous process which will

00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:48,510
make it in the truth processing engine

00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:49,830
which won't wait on paper in reality the

00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:56,040
problem is

00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:58,650
is the you can't use this tetanus

00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:03,210
Russian cuisine with any of the complex

00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:06,360
transformation if you do in 20 years

00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:13,650
it's far but if politely will tell you

00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:18,150
but I can't do this so uh this thing was

00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:23,070
still fighting with the friend of mine

00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:27,270
would be a mom with tangles and which as

00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:29,400
he looks witness and that's why I was

00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:33,390
giving the covers I wanted to show you

00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:46,170
this so what is happening here games

00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:55,790
there are rules one who is in what is

00:42:46,170 --> 00:43:02,270
things does it interrupts continuous

00:42:55,790 --> 00:43:02,270
execution in source get into the storage

00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:26,400
this footage is nothing it is the new

00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:51,360
beta it's doing man would stay in this

00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:56,970
case because continuous swimming most

00:43:51,360 --> 00:44:01,130
important it was to be over as two

00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:01,130
fundamental differences in spot

00:44:12,360 --> 00:46:09,660
so this is which because it gives knives

00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:12,120
which means a piece because yes there is

00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:15,120
way out

00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:17,550
represent them despite but in this case

00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:30,020
sequel engine is completely useless

00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:47,780
against no idea so then in control sweet

00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:47,780
