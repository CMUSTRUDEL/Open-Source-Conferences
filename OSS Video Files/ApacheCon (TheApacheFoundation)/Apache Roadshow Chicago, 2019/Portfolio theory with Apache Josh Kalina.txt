Title: Portfolio theory with Apache Josh Kalina
Publication date: 2019-06-19
Playlist: Apache Roadshow Chicago, 2019
Description: 
	Markowitz portfolio theory was a revolution in the way that Finance viewed risk and reward in Capital Markets. However, the theoryâ€™s pure application is usually relegated to theory in favor of more computationally lighter ways of reinterpreting Markowitz's original ideas. Within the formula, there is a covariance matrix that needs to be generated relative to the size of the number of assets. This is usually where Python, R or SPSS fail. To give context here, there are close to 110,000 publicly traded companies worldwide. That means creating a covariance of returns as large as 110,000 by 110,000. This creates issues too large for the likes of Python or R. In practice, individual assets are generally substituted out for sector funds or broad indices like the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000. However, lets give Markowitz his due. The goal of this presentation is to show how using Spark and the cloud, we can perform this computation within memory to get a better view of how a global portfolio should be weighted.

all right so the last time you actually

00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:11,790
go to Chicago track Joel's gonna be

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:16,490
talking about actions or my house or

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:19,770
however you say thank you

00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:35,190
Margaret's will be Cashman cahoots okay

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:38,850
today foray into the width all's that

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:43,170
came with it so this movie by gender

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:46,260
from toxic food my plan again who's Rafi

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:49,700
rated the company I work for movies was

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,700
modern polio theory

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,250
everybody goes kind of set up set to

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,940
show you three diamond and the

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:03,090
difference to the code between people

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:11,640
who like mathematical to teach them as

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:15,710
well and that is today's first all I

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,990
want to complete I am NOT a developer

00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:30,420
I'm actually sales person so one

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:32,460
supposed to me it's big question to more

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,329
or less assess where the code and he

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:39,119
didn't see it on Twitter it was 2018 so

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:42,960
I was pretty good advice and what about

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,939
learning now through those that are are

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,759
very diverse are as a statistical

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:53,220
programming language it doesn't like

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:56,520
radios it doesn't do very well so my

00:01:53,220 --> 00:02:03,600
fullest is advocating active floor where

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:07,469
developers reach so I started by 48

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,929
Python and then from there I because I

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:12,090
had a wealth of data in my disposal I

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:18,150
ran my natural which that

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:21,080
with five dollars well which after doing

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,550
a few things and the students who things

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,650
if they if Russia is trying to play with

00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,750
I think that their processors are three

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,770
lies you like this is eventually to be a

00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:35,400
problem why not find that solution catch

00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:37,170
to lose my house like tip Melton I'm

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,240
seeing look at natural that's that I'm

00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:44,420
so excited to go down a rabbit hole to

00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:47,070
figure out how use so a little bit more

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:57,390
raise some hands in living the eyes have

00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:58,830
you heard of the floor if you didn't

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,870
know that I'm not complaining to you we

00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:04,220
have a big head start now we used to be

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:06,870
the top stories from Prince Division

00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:12,540
become a about eight months of you know

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:14,940
Blackstone came through I decided to be

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,459
a Thomson Reuters of that division to

00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:26,340
subscribe that largest home day ovo

00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:30,720
tools in history the arts me what's over

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:33,900
here so we are idea we can financial

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,140
risks financial time series real time

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,239
quotes everything from the single

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,130
millisecond latency you know to HFC

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:46,610
stuff all the way to the end of day

00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:49,080
pricing reference at universities from

00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:54,780
people use words this could be relevant

00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:56,880
in latter part of the speech news news

00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,790
our need an advice reference data

00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:05,120
company risk to drag data we do it all

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:07,800
around gamut some exclusive content

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,830
issue here today I would you gauge

00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,910
string which is economic data time

00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:16,320
series data fundamentals a little bit

00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:18,959
there's something that you need for that

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,280
Universal way of economic factor model

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,970
would not be have it

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,460
to a web server on those things resonate

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:32,950
in stock later unless

00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:34,540
so yeah just Jeremy puppies alone one

00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,810
thing that's exciting to me is kind of

00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:40,780
the way that were attacking file

00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:44,470
recovery cloud agnostic strategy might

00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:48,190
be where customers are you are very easy

00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,720
to model and to do they're pretty

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:54,370
straight imposed traded in its rate

00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:57,190
research the meteor which brings me back

00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,000
to what market learn let's talk what are

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:02,950
we doing

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,070
so Markowitz portfolio optimization is

00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:08,260
basically a microsimulation trying to

00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:10,330
estimate as many different weights or

00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:13,270
portfolio a random access you can make

00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,820
it anywhere from two assets to numbers

00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:18,870
of SS had to determine the optimal

00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:26,020
weight for portfolio who cares

00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:30,430
people didn't he turns into findings no

00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:34,890
introductions folks we'll be discussing

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:36,970
fella hoots house spark Zeppelin

00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:40,419
decompose distributed matrices

00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:45,610
distributed parallel processing for

00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:50,130
those the audience is he programmed

00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:53,050
language that we use access magic spark

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:55,510
is an interpreted language insist on top

00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:58,720
scholar it allows us to basic things

00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:01,360
like your honor do a lot of economic

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,600
time streets problems and economic

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,370
problems general

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,790
cash be smart it's the edge of big data

00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:13,000
a little bit more of that later

00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:16,270
passage that would be a user interface

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,190
that was created I took it would easily

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:23,050
access scholar and the boots and you can

00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:25,750
find on at the same interpreter if you

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:28,090
like and then he composes really debates

00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,010
this is kind of our of I'm just using

00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:33,220
this framework

00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:36,370
as far as and useless then you have the

00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,970
ability to take large matrices break

00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,710
them apart

00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,330
I sent them off in different courts

00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,770
different computers and then at the end

00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,410
you'll apply to all that see the

00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:48,930
information back and they get the same

00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:52,690
table fact I would put a joke about that

00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:54,310
right so the boys finish part so I went

00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:57,250
out looking for a good explanation

00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:59,920
pretty close and if you find related

00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:02,230
like I'm alive from some I love where

00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,500
it's so bare literally splay like

00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:07,330
apartment I would never I would never be

00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,470
me something that's learned something

00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,180
it's hard

00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,370
I always happy to take a learning

00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,590
journey really you are taking it and

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,830
dirty up for you for weak spots perhaps

00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:22,000
yours you're gonna feel anything

00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:23,710
regardless this is what I found back

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,260
with

00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:29,410
wednesdaypatchy smart as far we're dead

00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:31,600
indeed and life eternal

00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:34,800
any resource that were incomplete the

00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:43,680
Gator X creates components technology

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:46,960
it's the same police actual interface

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,850
now I could do some actual research go

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:54,310
into an X website these are beauties

00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:56,470
Ponte so esse background but Yahoo did a

00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:59,700
fantastic project at the at the

00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:02,830
attachment Apache Software Foundation

00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:05,440
where they created who has been the

00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:08,830
engine of a big data pretty much ever

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,810
since Apache spark something that it's

00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,520
kind of like the next iteration there's

00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:15,730
a lot of other bits he studies the map

00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,230
and reduce attaching to do other they do

00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:21,610
a lot of things and others do things a

00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:23,340
lot best which Big Data equal side of

00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:30,550
his buttons

00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:43,050
so faster generality to buy a bunch of

00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:43,050
different data sources and funny joke

00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:51,920
and wizards the moon is interpreted

00:08:49,489 --> 00:08:54,949
language it sits on top scholar must do

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,049
data analysis that that is relevant

00:08:54,949 --> 00:09:00,019
important person said mark listen any

00:08:57,049 --> 00:09:01,730
kind of unit obstruct and again a very

00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:05,179
powerful point here's a pretty far

00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:08,029
exceeds that region by that after a ton

00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:11,329
of threats over a single single machine

00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:13,249
or over a network of machines that

00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:16,989
easily collect them back that's so that

00:09:13,249 --> 00:09:16,989
you have relevant high education

00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:27,819
finances first murderous then we'll talk

00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:31,129
history flow theory just quickly fire

00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:34,100
state risk returns here as well as the

00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:37,519
Sharpe ratio back to who was three

00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:42,769
murders and this temper young man in

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:45,529
here he was a 1990 Nobel winner for his

00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:50,149
theory of mind for the theory Mexican

00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:53,179
students model that would ameliorate a

00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:55,459
smile under 40 that's a lot of the ideas

00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:57,529
we have today about personification of

00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:59,149
rest and multitasking there's much

00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:03,980
status from the research they did and

00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:04,999
deliver back in 1952 he created the idea

00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,160
of an efficient set

00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:11,329
Sophia defective latex portfolio of

00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:13,549
assets that Fox can get closer to be

00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:15,439
that efficient set we have the most

00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:17,059
efficient portfolio and does some

00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:20,059
reducing the amount of risks and how

00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:22,910
human returns we can for any practice

00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:24,350
report quarters check a check so what

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:27,139
are the implications are risk manager

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:29,720
and finance as a whole so this leads to

00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:32,749
a capital asset

00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,749
I see model which is which is a net

00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:38,569
result in this research that really

00:10:35,749 --> 00:10:40,730
posits the correlation of individual

00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:43,549
assets against private market which

00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:45,699
really opens up later research we find

00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:48,699
about holding back to models about

00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:48,699
efficient

00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:58,529
and moderate quality finances - all

00:10:55,949 --> 00:11:00,569
right so to quickly go over theory so we

00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:04,049
can set the rest of power this is the

00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:05,639
two assets portfolio this is but if you

00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:07,499
haven't seen this in finance you're

00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:11,239
probably even explore - it's a

00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:14,699
fundamental basis for a lot of planning

00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:17,279
and yet here we have two exits you have

00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:19,799
bonds and stocks that of those two

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:23,759
things they were totally involved is a

00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:30,679
straight line and you can see that we

00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:33,989
have a risk stocks at higher risk period

00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:36,179
happens incrementally a nice ass with my

00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:38,609
portfolio you go over the overall risk

00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:43,109
he painted the brochure boom

00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:45,779
19:05 other a certain increasing go over

00:11:43,109 --> 00:11:50,459
that or that competition you start

00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:54,689
seeing something to the cave lion over

00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:57,929
here so it actually pays to continue to

00:11:54,689 --> 00:12:01,079
increase the amount of Sox unit that

00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:06,059
will develop a fluid now I can you serve

00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:08,369
that against the Sharpe ratio and then

00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:10,139
generally Swiss points either this also

00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:11,970
lends to the capital allocation ramp

00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:14,849
this is the efficient frontier

00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:17,970
Kevin are a few minor find the tangency

00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:20,879
we're going to do with rich go

00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,559
it also says I'm in terms of beyond the

00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,169
efficient frontier by mixing in with

00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:28,499
what over here the y-intercept is the

00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:31,289
risk-free rate increased values y

00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:37,919
intercepts with with risky assets

00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:40,529
actually ok so a little bit about that

00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:43,589
before that's why is this an issue so

00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:48,059
you can create the portfolio to assets

00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:51,479
simple however on the third day we have

00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:54,869
over 180,000 listed charts that's the

00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:57,059
universe 180,000 puppies which starts

00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:59,519
becoming very perilous to Bob

00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:02,490
however as I'm in the end

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,619
we have 87 million active bricks bricks

00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,720
which are that part Empire and get our

00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:09,360
tablets that we have our system so

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,629
there's up to 27 million assets that you

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,459
can model within our universe on earth

00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:16,350
that's not even yet because part of the

00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:20,670
solution theory says the efficient

00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:23,459
portfolio anything available investable

00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:26,040
assets universe so that means walking

00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:28,170
down the street to your local gossip row

00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,809
sort of McDonald's franchise and saying

00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:32,699
hey I want to see your franchise because

00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:36,149
I'm gonna make we're fully a little bit

00:13:32,699 --> 00:13:39,209
more muscle that's not very efficient or

00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:40,769
possible and then also he could drug

00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:43,230
dealer on the corner of the street

00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:44,790
swinging dime bags theoretically you

00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:51,449
need a piece of piece of goods business

00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:56,339
in order to get the most believe legal

00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:59,279
reasons I'm going to say then to that

00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:01,649
end to the research I'm going to show

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,230
you because as deal in your druthers you

00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:07,379
can you can get as crazy with this as

00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:10,470
you want you can go down to our minute

00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:14,240
tip alternative is for trains and the

00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:17,549
demon becomes really big really good

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:21,119
alright so mrs. DeMarco is bullet on the

00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:26,189
S&P 500 a few things that you'll see

00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:30,749
there's a lot of a lewis remodel now

00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:32,490
with 500 companies and three years with

00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:35,850
the daily data this is what i was able

00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:45,959
to come up with and in a lot of

00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:51,029
different iterations alright so one of

00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:54,119
the data to to create the weight say

00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:59,819
that three county returns or calculate

00:14:54,119 --> 00:15:05,819
risk by someone located really do this

00:14:59,819 --> 00:15:08,040
in the in the loop iteration but if ipod

00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:11,249
could be very easily but i've at the

00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,390
base - Laura - this is I just maybe I

00:15:11,249 --> 00:15:15,690
college for each

00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:16,890
service API and I think principal was

00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,390
already a fight about wrapping around it

00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:20,790
and I call it in

00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:22,620
Esther credentials and then define your

00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,870
tickets and fields and the things he

00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,399
blocked that's three years and then we

00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:29,550
have a ticker they capture something S&P

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:34,050
500 risks and I burn and you got it

00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:37,649
right we also took the blogger terms of

00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:41,220
those those prices and then just grunts

00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:45,060
drop the first value because as many as

00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:50,130
you could be the outwards to be mostly

00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:52,130
date framed pretty easy to read all

00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:55,950
right iterates to create the weight

00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:58,980
right so basically what this or this

00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:05,450
step in the process is Thomas go ahead

00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:05,450
and give you a matrix initialized serums

00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,029
you can you can make that split most as

00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:16,519
you want you're going to get better

00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:20,040
returns at the end if you do and your

00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:25,949
dream and that's it that's the Monte

00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:27,750
Carlo simulation portion and what I'm

00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:29,370
showing you here is my generation of

00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:33,959
this and this is time with Janet and

00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:39,810
boots and we did with a few most full

00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:48,140
disclosure I kept that mostly by you

00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:51,779
please so basically very similar

00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:54,600
basically down here this is where were

00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:58,050
generate a bunch of random numbers just

00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:20,209
import weights object down here Yahoo's

00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:20,209
normalizing this returns all right so

00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:27,030
as you can see through simple stick

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,480
weight States by converts since its

00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:33,870
daily day they just multiply attended to

00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:37,680
opportunities to hear the pursuit of

00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:40,560
iteration loop iteration and yeah a few

00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:44,420
things to note satchel about a booth

00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:47,220
with assistance it leverages a lot more

00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:50,550
natural mathematical occasion and

00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:54,320
expression so as you see here this

00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:56,840
indicates that were two majors math and

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,310
simple you're just doing the weights

00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,680
weights matrix times of occurrence

00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:04,170
matrix multiplying attacks Twitter could

00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:08,070
consider to analyze it in class Nick

00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:12,570
after we've distributed your stuff you

00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:18,060
can get a vector output for returns set

00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:21,420
for the rest so this is the bet we're

00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:23,550
gonna multiply the variance times that

00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:29,670
wakes multiplied the N times the

00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:36,990
transposition of weeks a pretty simple

00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:41,400
implementation doesn't look natural as

00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:43,920
you can see were doing a six I'd dot

00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,950
matrix multiplication using at least you

00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:50,700
method instead of the more dementia use

00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:53,160
case that use which is crazier are it's

00:18:50,700 --> 00:19:01,350
just using the multiplication symbol for

00:18:53,160 --> 00:19:03,330
each it's a small so our enemy had a lot

00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:08,640
of contributors a lot of time to get it

00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:11,940
right and I understand about for

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:15,810
contributor mu not there's no by our

00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:19,710
phone be so they don't have to make that

00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:23,310
it's easy issues all we did a basically

00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:25,290
an iteration over B over the majors of

00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:29,160
cells trying to Diane College in Sofia

00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:34,500
the various in this case and this is

00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:35,130
yellow the vector output of 5 all right

00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,410
look

00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:42,960
sure now even the Sharpe ratio what is

00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:45,809
this operation another another Nobel

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,140
laureate create this concept of Sharpe

00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:50,669
ratio it's nothing to be able to tell

00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:54,870
too many risks to financial markets

00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:58,919
interstate returns undefined it by by

00:19:54,870 --> 00:20:00,510
the variance of this case the

00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,580
implementation and I've gotten pretty

00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:05,190
simple this is making the whole cubist

00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:07,610
given maximize that number in order to

00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:10,470
determine the optimal portfolio

00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:14,720
implementation from Socrates and I'm

00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:18,990
just using my competition of that max

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:21,480
I'm sure dr. then there's some of you

00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:24,840
move you don't need difference that I

00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,890
kind of make u-turns that we had do some

00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:33,860
weird to Maggie

00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:33,860
Scotland right

00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:49,260
so kind of pretty cool computation and

00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:52,200
this one's back with now we were able to

00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:55,110
kind of have it with Python coefficient

00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,000
coding regular or things disk to try to

00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:59,159
get a image like this and get the

00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,260
numbers backward I love the way to get

00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:07,289
the optimal portfolio you simply author

00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:10,530
lists again letting it back to you what

00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:13,500
if we use of 108,000 assets like how

00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:16,679
could be could be push this this

00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:19,980
daughter to be seen for several

00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:23,929
tournaments with an optimal portfolio

00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:28,770
can be busted our risk to the S&P 500 by

00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:30,590
just just using the publicity yeah

00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:35,340
absolutely

00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:36,120
which I guess put the big a string

00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,370
stubborn quits

00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,289
it's a very probabilistic model but

00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:42,240
there's a lot fundamental attribution

00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:45,540
what's going on or the criticisms

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,130
actually so for instance they're not

00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:49,440
they treat everything as the

00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:52,090
your representation of past performance

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,280
there's no there's no waiting for

00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:57,910
respective terms by how many how many

00:21:54,280 --> 00:22:01,120
tweets yours he open cell or college

00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:05,220
systemic risk is introduced by President

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,220
of the United States public send tweets

00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:12,130
it's a very good model for thinking and

00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:15,660
creeping and really taking the next step

00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:15,660
behind your fundamental analysis

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:25,390
organization nice and wait all right so

00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:30,870
you can only see this benighted

00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:34,390
today this guy using a big sword to come

00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:37,480
and then superpose the guy coming in

00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:42,940
says me the sword is Python and be

00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:46,480
honest all times for its a very good use

00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:49,210
the best tool available for you so while

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:53,950
we like to say that you should use the

00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:57,159
best school possibly available so

00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:59,950
starting from the loop takes less time

00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:02,020
to learn the language temperamental

00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:05,350
spark there's just there's just a lot of

00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:08,470
variables x brushes and probably like

00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,980
those outside of the front status

00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,809
updates

00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,340
it says suicide and learn another

00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:16,360
programming language we would you know

00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:18,039
the story gets harder if you're not

00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,780
necessarily able to memorize something

00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:21,669
that you're talking about something

00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:25,809
approaching deep whites and perhaps to

00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:28,270
reminds me of ice data perhaps to do

00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:29,200
better tool need to build a fisherman

00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:32,049
greatness Clark

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,450
I said it over a form of servers and

00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:38,559
then be able to efficiently collect and

00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:41,309
and really activity plots
