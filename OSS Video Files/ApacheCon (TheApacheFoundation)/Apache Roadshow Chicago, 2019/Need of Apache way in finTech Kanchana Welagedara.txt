Description: 
	The Apache Way is a set of community behaviors and aspects used to great success over many years at over 100 Apache Software Foundation projects. Fintech takes lessons learned from developing software at ASF and applies them to the way companies develop software internally.It builds up an great engineering echo system to deviate from traditional engineering silos and create more opportunities for innovation , business velocity and better engineering collaboration.

	00:00:06,350 --> 00:01:36,240
so we've got here today so that means

00:01:29,970 --> 00:02:00,290
people sequence points begins those and

00:01:36,240 --> 00:02:00,290
people vary when we face is what happens

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,349
next

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:12,349
what is so

00:03:40,989 --> 00:04:11,949
so so we need to address the underlying

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:15,769
regulations who evolve the need of

00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:20,690
technology to address these X's and O's

00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:25,030
it made a huge difference an easier life

00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,030
and also no need of

00:04:54,520 --> 00:06:32,960
so so in 2016 so so you see how the

00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:33,830
technology needs and and dressing long

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:47,920
RVs

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:55,940
cities and putting on together so gtex

00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:58,820
financial technologies the way let me go

00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:03,470
enough priority the real chance of

00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:09,650
companies like IBM and here

00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:13,490
big giant companies which provide a

00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:17,510
software and the most because they have

00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:20,720
the money to utilize their convenience

00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:24,680
of using that in fact satisfaction and

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,970
actually the CTO business around the

00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:31,820
SATA solution by Delaney evaluation by

00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:35,300
easy access for personnel to use their

00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:40,900
services financial services so Wow what

00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:43,580
happened with this with this approach so

00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:48,680
immediately like company scientific

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:52,010
movement the big banks what we take over

00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:55,460
the ears start using these providers

00:07:52,010 --> 00:08:00,160
they have one version to another updates

00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,160
if those are creates based groups

00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:11,050
architecture which feels engineering

00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:15,500
cycles so if you take if you if you join

00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:18,170
my first response with first night they

00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:21,400
asked turning here is all system which I

00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:27,080
need you John and then bring that to the

00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:30,650
services the tent is like when they get

00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:34,250
that excite us we somewhere here on net

00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:39,470
tech tech tech or else believe me now

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:44,130
any innovation from developers and we we

00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:47,670
are not evolving just fooling around

00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:50,699
some modern India provides to us so that

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:53,810
we needs above competencies that we

00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:56,240
means the innovation that remains the

00:08:53,810 --> 00:09:01,589
architecture growth which will happen

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:04,740
horizontally so the problem will

00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:08,370
disappear in silos began in the deep end

00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:12,480
with some here some other teams he

00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:14,490
journeyed to depend with some reusable

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,759
software which is already functioning

00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:20,519
and tested and nicely done and somebody

00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:34,440
else is using a desktop column on the

00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:38,279
cycle and there is no taking us so

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,829
finding a solution for that these are

00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:49,560
some of the issues that I talked to

00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:52,680
teach evolution of the architecture the

00:09:49,560 --> 00:10:04,110
horizontal expansion theorem of nature

00:09:52,680 --> 00:10:08,040
and in how many how do we say is it

00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:33,420
deployable is it is it written once and

00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:41,009
can be deployed anywhere so this one

00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:45,269
will be around the co system engineering

00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:48,810
of engines and also the cultural

00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:52,130
behavior so people come through work you

00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:57,149
my heart you start with the

00:10:52,130 --> 00:11:00,690
some huge I'm back I even forgot the

00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:04,640
idea all old-fashioned stock carries me

00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:11,579
away away from now and he gets up and he

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:15,120
can move on we had to do software

00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:20,750
English teams you okay our solution we

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:25,880
know what to do he can't act so that

00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,880
behavior that we get frustration and

00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:51,570
knowledge and also like people talk

00:11:37,290 --> 00:12:01,380
about because I have a knowledge for me

00:11:51,570 --> 00:12:09,540
so somebody else learn so there is no

00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:22,640
home witnessing the culture and the

00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:24,870
business and many others but their work

00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:29,000
if we are holding the knowledge that

00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:32,810
somebody else wanted to move forward and

00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,810
is not transparent

00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:42,360
so that is what this is my and the

00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:44,250
management's me manage me has a lack of

00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:49,470
awareness of how to solve this problem

00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:52,730
and maybe they don't know how how this

00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:56,540
has been to pay so

00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:59,300
life for me honestly - a major problem

00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:08,120
with the management how do you need a

00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:10,850
situation also like the people to stop

00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,490
it and become experts on you get out

00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:30,800
from the company but they can do so and

00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:40,370
also these people are nice because - no

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:43,430
matter how good you concepts you can you

00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:45,650
can be cultivated what you were years to

00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:53,990
the company at the same - there is no

00:13:45,650 --> 00:14:03,310
recognized being and it's filled up and

00:13:53,990 --> 00:14:03,310
the energy base so how this year's

00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:18,860
released quality stopped here it is

00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:21,290
producing a still to use that if their

00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:28,190
businesses when you grow that and use it

00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:30,440
the businesses how this is being done in

00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:33,410
an artistic a foundation or any other

00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:44,660
business communities so he is on a

00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:49,940
foundation and stillness and one of the

00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:53,240
wonderful instance as I should be I only

00:14:49,940 --> 00:15:00,440
talk about community over old because

00:14:53,240 --> 00:15:02,890
that's how we approach this antique or

00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,890
out of

00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:15,779
community to use commune when you go to

00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:28,380
Satya access to people you don't know

00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:32,760
you don't even have to see each other

00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:34,830
guys we had a bunch of people gathered

00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:40,320
together and we had bunch of people

00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:45,350
sitting together and so we over a

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,350
project proposal people work for that

00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:53,930
technology national debt is fine

00:15:50,670 --> 00:16:03,029
so when we put the proposal we have the

00:15:53,930 --> 00:16:05,339
incubator incubates so we can each and

00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:14,579
start watching and they provide the

00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:18,120
infrastructure so once you establish a

00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:24,240
collaboration within that your UK limits

00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:29,510
what's all in it and you can berate and

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:35,779
then this all work through the

00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:35,779
collaboration and so so we need

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:46,170
technology to deliver the country

00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:49,920
subject and then you can see those we do

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:55,770
well desire when you get this kind of

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:59,430
project you when you become you start

00:16:55,770 --> 00:17:04,410
into building it's not another release

00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:11,699
and documentation should be - sure and

00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:14,660
subnet after software in Rome which is a

00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,660
global profile

00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:21,110
to the community and increase the

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,659
community and begin - your credibility

00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:28,500
forever the teamwork you build

00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:34,740
credibility on let's drive you and when

00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:40,529
I first participate for conference even

00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:44,159
you know then even you know in a walking

00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:45,960
conference until I introduced myself so

00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:50,070
it doesn't matter about we talk about

00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:54,360
the workspace we talk about specially

00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:56,279
refraction of competition up the

00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:00,149
cooperating man and we talked about the

00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:04,769
diversity the people riots and we talked

00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:06,690
about girls also cool and that doesn't

00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:19,049
really matter you don't even see each

00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:21,990
other all manatees you get in a people

00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:27,600
start believing it's very there are

00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:31,080
rainbows we know that you and we also

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:37,980
doubt in in Internet is infrastructure

00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:41,940
people too so the idea expertise and our

00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:45,509
situation between will be ecstasy access

00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:48,330
Java to you there were people from China

00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:51,570
the People's English and they start

00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:54,029
hiring Chinese in this initially started

00:18:51,570 --> 00:19:00,629
in text fans paid for that google trans

00:18:54,029 --> 00:19:04,440
trans it was they are that case so the

00:19:00,629 --> 00:19:08,340
meritocracy is what as as a contributor

00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:15,360
as a user what you what you make too big

00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:20,809
they make your product and and the

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:23,170
community are fair and will you be proud

00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:25,810
assuming they belong I'm Jake tragic

00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:28,720
we'll make a different proposal for that

00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:33,190
so many of the lazy sequences which

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:35,680
means that the father but we do the all

00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:38,530
the communication transparent so

00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:41,980
everybody knows so the people who like

00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:44,230
the purple stuff they can say oh last

00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,270
one and if you disagree you can be

00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:51,100
simply with a reason that should be a

00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:58,510
very increase entities you can disagree

00:19:51,100 --> 00:20:04,210
with the minus 1 which when still you

00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:07,960
can you can bring your ideas and you're

00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:11,770
going to fire you can express and the

00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:18,210
silence is consent if you don't respond

00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:18,210
to any by any any proposal the community

00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:54,010
it's because it is trans so those

00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:57,160
mornings I'm a little rusty so the

00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:58,920
reality is like I said earlier the

00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:14,950
internet infrastructure based

00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:18,660
communication infrastructure so you can

00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:25,510
find different religious and you can ask

00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:28,020
its infrastructure based community unity

00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,020
is the best

00:21:45,129 --> 00:22:53,929
so similar but much more efficient so

00:22:50,269 --> 00:23:03,440
the quality leadership is one of the key

00:22:53,929 --> 00:23:05,840
things that we we we we have seen that

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,600
my management I have to be behind you

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,990
even know the science and engineering

00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:14,149
students I know what is open-source my

00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:28,309
second year so my manager the some

00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:34,009
people and he was my mentor and he gave

00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:36,650
me how to list lot of things to know how

00:23:34,009 --> 00:23:39,650
it you know about consider

00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:42,710
that's a big deal and public and

00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:46,160
homicidal to the box each other

00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:49,190
the most efficient carry us the college

00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:52,490
initiative means and he kept responsive

00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:55,340
my my questions that what we can

00:23:52,490 --> 00:24:01,040
immediately thus we start the project we

00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:03,860
need have many community the ultimate is

00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:08,290
mentorship in to be responsive in

00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:13,730
Tuscany persistent also educational goal

00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:27,470
you able to as a quality mental you

00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:31,630
should be able to so the unique and

00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:39,920
started as a user but you get a person

00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:43,840
committed second so this is a sponsors

00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:47,930
are we talk about are we behave in a

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:51,260
community of bring up an idea I will

00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:55,550
make a priest or a sheet of project and

00:24:51,260 --> 00:25:00,470
what making here so Vega or somebody

00:24:55,550 --> 00:25:03,110
else's idea a criticism is within the

00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:10,630
big guys this is a little tricky part

00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:14,270
but I know financial company

00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:17,630
cybersecurity oceans so those legal

00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:20,210
heart here it is really well we are

00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:31,640
smart enough to do so the idea is like

00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:34,370
the license provides is friendly

00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,740
opportunities we can moderate and use

00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:39,460
your own business and you can be

00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:45,970
published whatever you want

00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:45,970
so having a pre Hemingway stop there

00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,930
[Applause]

00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:42,060
relation I'm sure any kisara any Metroid

00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:42,060
financial organization

00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:55,630
you know what you do wrong the legal

00:26:44,740 --> 00:27:02,650
aspects of that opening that API so we

00:26:55,630 --> 00:27:05,800
talked about the engineering silos me

00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:10,570
explain about the FSB and then we look

00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:14,550
at the attention of another FinTech

00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:19,390
companies how do you rate you see the

00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:22,470
difference so we know that we have

00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:29,140
engineering silos and we do that

00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:30,910
constantly saying there are certain

00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:35,610
things that we need to do if you ever

00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:37,960
consider the way to bring it into your

00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:41,710
it doesn't have to be the company

00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:47,190
initially we we were trying to have the

00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:47,190
same thing in the team realizing

00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:55,230
decoration and we we

00:27:55,390 --> 00:28:05,440
my position without digital platforms so

00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:10,299
by the experience is in areas that we

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:14,070
can look at to solve that and take

00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:19,059
example the price you paid an

00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:22,150
independent financial organization you

00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:26,490
can scale it down on 14 and you can

00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:29,490
think about the community and we need to

00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,490
understand

00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:56,970
so each engineering team has a different

00:28:47,429 --> 00:28:59,440
issue that they and it could be so

00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:05,890
understanding the problem is very

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:10,270
important and we need to find a way how

00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:15,970
we can simplify yeah she works for my

00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:23,679
team I should be as a practice practice

00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:27,580
it's a year and you bring that bring

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:33,030
that values to the financial

00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:38,860
organization by understanding and

00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:42,610
understanding what hurts the team so

00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:46,450
they're Indian I was in Nam I was in

00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:49,990
your product similar similar to a cow

00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:51,030
and when this Indian small startup

00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:56,230
finance

00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:59,020
they do application they said we know

00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:02,110
that they appreciate OB between takes me

00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:04,110
put documentation and reactive because

00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:07,050
we are Tex diagrams in

00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:10,050
the confluence so the other team would

00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:12,300
see that is not to be moved stop

00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:15,900
blushing to be eight cups or the other

00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:19,410
people can send a pull request and we

00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:21,720
shoot them to help and do the review

00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:23,940
properly and we preserve those

00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:30,990
communication we need know that we

00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:34,620
between fashion beef ability teams and

00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:39,059
maybe get software engineering ecosystem

00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:55,080
very well by learning the recipe much so

00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:59,700
it could be the different phases within

00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:03,300
the firewall within an organization so

00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:05,370
this is for the investors and they deal

00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:09,420
in a very smart way they identified new

00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:11,460
teams and the community community one

00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:16,350
could be they problem solve different

00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:19,140
and one of us for you beginning of our

00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:27,030
course we what attach to be evaluated

00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:30,750
for UT they started within the HR system

00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:33,740
they started merging those players in

00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:36,809
the team and of who somebody has to be

00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:40,340
mean either we are this is what happened

00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:43,620
this is how they affected works and they

00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:48,480
values they try to determine the

00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:55,309
engineering science team and there were

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:55,309
success to wins out there so sorry mom

00:32:00,860 --> 00:33:27,090
so so so so everybody companies in the

00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:34,830
corporate environment overcome so we can

00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:38,460
bring those chains so the immediate X we

00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:42,000
need to look at more security of the

00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:51,390
data because the money which is moving

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:56,250
here so we virtual the cyber security

00:33:51,390 --> 00:34:01,740
the data is including production that

00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:06,510
was common regulations regulations and

00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:07,540
we need to make sure that your I mean in

00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:11,440
security

00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:31,530
we need the team with you oh I'm doing

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:38,530
it being dumb three hours of time and so

00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:42,340
that's why I need to address an upward

00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:44,590
pressure between the provided face of

00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:54,159
your firewall and the security teams

00:34:44,590 --> 00:35:01,090
they need they need to I am sure they

00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:02,620
have already William - meaning - what

00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:05,890
can he do

00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:13,000
don't and you don't send tools we need

00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:18,480
to isolate in these aspects so we we

00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,480
talk about me it will be assuming that

00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:31,390
as you needed I need some software free

00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:38,140
software and also the by each project

00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:38,650
lesson we official documentation station

00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:44,170
structure

00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:46,990
Pixar and developer guy initially we

00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:53,670
have seen that in Union that happening

00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:53,670
maybe across so as a son you see

00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:05,040
mentally not only using that you see a

00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:08,410
buggy so you will become a continuous

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:12,100
inventory camera will give you this key

00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:16,300
contributions another few months ending

00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:17,110
your name it a lot of efficient path

00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:21,010
pixel

00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:34,180
and yes surely the helicopter project

00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:37,270
and someone realized traction MV and

00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:38,050
here is the light plz level within your

00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:40,210
company

00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:43,240
the initial technical decision vehicles

00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:46,120
are the objects we can follow the series

00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:49,810
you know maybe engines muta so that you

00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:54,400
can adhere your engineering team you

00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:56,980
know the new comer become a new comment

00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:10,060
between become user they follow around

00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:12,910
the world and become a user and so this

00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:18,490
is the same pyramid we follow in FX's

00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:20,800
Apache bait so we will get started down

00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:26,130
in silos

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,130
he said this is how we connect now and

00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:36,630
that is one - this is France - faction

00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:42,940
that you need to make sure that we make

00:37:36,630 --> 00:38:01,440
the colony code so city will be doing

00:37:42,940 --> 00:38:15,070
something they will provide in Antibes

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:19,750
same equation documentation another in

00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:23,710
comic join the team you can see that

00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:25,559
person is looking at the same question

00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:28,390
running to the same push the gas

00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:30,160
disgustin all details are given so

00:38:28,390 --> 00:39:59,530
that's how they I had a community book

00:38:30,160 --> 00:40:01,890
the user so the behavior changes we give

00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:15,900
that person an opportunity to raise up

00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:18,369
media company nicotine and cultivated

00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:24,220
metals a person to be in the leadership

00:40:18,369 --> 00:40:29,250
of unity and all services managed they

00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:32,920
realized in heat win this thing

00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:37,740
initially but maybe we are doing as

00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,740
practice by DTH are

00:41:03,410 --> 00:42:10,200
so yes intentional Minds they have a

00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:19,530
company the people who usually do

00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:22,380
something different over the process in

00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:24,680
these individuals may behave in many

00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:33,390
ways so this is a good way to bring that

00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:40,550
constant within your tips which I am

00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:40,550
doing - where to be that's some of us

00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:46,470
so you show something something by me is

00:44:43,070 --> 00:46:03,340
the group of consent is the best way

00:44:46,470 --> 00:46:07,960
so so so so so I guess some time and

00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:10,990
then decide on something that's how they

00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:12,310
approach comedians - doesn't matter when

00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:16,840
I see the manager

00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:19,870
I see what you through as you so what

00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:23,020
you go to the community it is a bit less

00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:27,750
Lisa because it's so hard to meet some

00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:27,750
of the people some of the people so if

00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:32,130
