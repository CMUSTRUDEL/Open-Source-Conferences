Your app is written in Javascript, and that's not going to change. Your app needs a cache, and you want to use Apache Geode for your caching layer. Until now, you've been out of luck. VMware has developed a Node.js Client for Apache Geode. The donation to Apache Geode is in progress. Stay tuned! You can keep your Javascript app, and use the Node.js Client to interact with an Apache Geode cluster.
