	Apache Geode: Exposing just one ip for all your gateway receivers in K8s

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

Apache Geode uses gateway senders and gateway receivers for events replication in multisite configuration. Each receiver usually has its own ip, which has some drawbacks in cloud environments as Kubernetes. In this talk I would like to show why we decided to expose all our gateway receivers with the same ip, the problems we found, the solution proposed and how I contributed it to Geode.

Alberto is a Computer Science engineer by Carlos III University of Madrid, with a Master on Software Craftsmanship by Polytechnic University of Madrid. He has been working at Ericsson Spain since 2008 mainly as Software Developer. Since 2019 he works as Open Source Developer contributing to Apache Geode, a data management platform ( in-memory data grid ) that provides real-time, consistent access to data-intensive applications throughout widely distributed cloud architectures.
