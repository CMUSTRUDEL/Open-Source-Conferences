	00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:12,030
all right I guess we can start now it's

00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:14,699
1720 so yeah thank you for showing up

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,330
thank you for all your time thank you

00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:21,119
for being here I'm gonna talk with you

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:24,630
about low class and caustic agent

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:29,490
connections yeah my name is sporty on

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,619
Pharma software just a cheap cook and

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,940
[Applause]

00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:34,890
yeah I'm gonna do an overview about the

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,000
future what it what it is

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,110
what problem that it doesn't fix and

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,560
basically I'm gonna show you a little

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:47,760
bit of demo on how to use it and that's

00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:50,150
right there so you know a little bit

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:55,080
about me

00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:57,570
you know I break stuff that's a brew I

00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:01,470
have one in ten years in software

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:04,470
testing couple of disciplines are

00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:09,390
specialized in adjoint sheep gluing and

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:11,549
class dr. 2016 so speaking of most of

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:15,380
the people here are quite still

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:18,509
relatively new to call stack but yeah

00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:25,499
bit about sheep go I think your guys

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:30,810
know we are some clients just skip

00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:33,030
through yeah some of you about the so

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:38,060
fellow little bastard cause future of

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:41,880
toxic agents so what it does it's

00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:46,170
basically offers you up software our way

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,990
to replace a regular load balancing

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:52,619
distance machine the truth is when we

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:58,350
use to mine shorter connections from the

00:01:52,619 --> 00:02:03,779
agent to the management servers it's

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:08,009
built on top of both management server

00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:11,310
and the caustic agent so the ecologic

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:13,860
and who misses software these changes

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,319
are basically inside docked in DD

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,939
software so it comes with with tall

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,879
stack you don't need to install anything

00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:24,360
more than that just to use it

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,890
it supports a few configuration of the

00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,220
returns that you can tell you to I

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:32,670
switch your setup and has a fallback

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:38,700
mechanism that exact fight you would

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:41,400
find pretty neat so let's talk about the

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,890
general setup that you probably use when

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,810
you have a cluster management my way so

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:49,590
you could say that in within your clouds

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:51,120
we have three management servers and the

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,640
Dozen of course doesn't matter

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,930
so what a normal setup would look like

00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:00,209
is your management server self connected

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:05,189
to the host threw out a load balancer

00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:06,719
shape so that's nothing this additional

00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:07,590
that's great there's nothing wrong about

00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,040
that

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:14,819
but if we who try to think about it

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:20,180
let's let's think about a couple of

00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:20,180
downsides downsides in it so you have

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:28,370
costs infrastructure to set it up you

00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:32,849
need to build up machine thread

00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:35,340
dedicated it comes on our own a certain

00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:39,150
cost it can be I can be open source but

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:42,180
ya want to this efficient product or

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,340
we're gonna be money friend and of

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,600
course it takes queuing time to set it

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:50,740
up to cook it up and this

00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:54,790
to visit every senior in your in frost

00:03:50,740 --> 00:04:01,540
if we for example imagine that you need

00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:06,400
to you need to set up like Fargo rules

00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:08,590
or if you use for example SSL connection

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,230
between the secured connection between

00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:13,720
the management and host soon it could be

00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:18,160
you could take time to to set up

00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,360
basically so within the the software

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,150
that we've built

00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:25,390
you simply eliminate that Singapore the

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:27,190
failure and you carry out with the

00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,610
direct connection between the management

00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:33,820
and the DEA agent so meaning that the

00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:36,640
whole global logic is taken out and it's

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,520
been implemented in the my both in the

00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,360
management server and the hosts so

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,040
during this simple picture you have

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:49,200
diagram showing the primary connection

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,520
between the management and host and

00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:55,050
backup connections to all day with

00:04:51,520 --> 00:05:00,280
management's that you have to know about

00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:04,600
so a little bit to summon up about the

00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,160
the feature it comes built-in you don't

00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,620
need to install anything you know you

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,190
don't need to support anything more than

00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:14,890
that it's like easy to use and I'll show

00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:18,300
you in a few seconds you know demo and

00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,300
of course it's free

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:26,380
yeah so as I mentioned that it's built

00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:30,639
for classic ancients only meaning that

00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:36,370
your KVM hosts your system gaps are

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:40,930
going to use it you can can design the

00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:45,190
logic that you want to implement it it

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:47,290
uses do you already already provided

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:50,639
setting within the global settings it's

00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:55,180
it uses the list that you set for host

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:58,810
and utilizes that for you for the

00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:01,830
algorithms and does not require a

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:05,830
restart we need two changes so you can

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:07,630
directly go add another cost and change

00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:10,030
the list in the global settings and you

00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:12,820
don't have to restart it to make it work

00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:19,330
you simply pick it up and distributed

00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:22,090
propagated to all the classic agents so

00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:26,410
the setting is caught in direct agent

00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:33,370
called Bastian algorithm this setting

00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:36,970
basically shows you basically set what

00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:38,800
are going you're going to use for the

00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,340
logic of all glancin so we have three

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,539
options

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:45,820
static round-robin and shuffle so static

00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:48,130
is pretty much obvious whatever you

00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,530
define in that list in the group vamos

00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:53,800
setting that would get propagated to the

00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:57,850
two old agnostic agents they will use

00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:00,130
every one of them will use the same rest

00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:02,860
it's not really balancing anything but

00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:09,250
it's sort of the disabled mode of the

00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:12,190
future shuffle shuffle is if you really

00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,310
want to use something random it will

00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,340
generate

00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:19,580
inglis or on the base of that list that

00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:22,940
you set in the sitting and it will

00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:27,260
generate around them around the newest

00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:30,320
for each host and who propagated to and

00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:33,170
the the other of the last option that

00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:38,540
you have currently is round-robin so

00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:40,880
that's pretty simple logic tier to do

00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:43,750
the balancing between the resources that

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:47,630
you have so for example if you have

00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:51,770
let's say three management's and dozen

00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:54,490
of hosts so first course we will get the

00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:57,440
order of first and second and third

00:07:54,490 --> 00:08:00,200
management server the other will get the

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:04,280
third the second the third and first one

00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:06,770
and the the next one will get the third

00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:11,540
the first and the second one and that

00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:17,570
will repeat until you get all the lists

00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:19,970
of of course yeah a couple of words

00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:23,150
about the fullback mechanism so you have

00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:26,600
another setting that is interval where

00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:28,960
the agent will look if it's connected to

00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:32,480
the right host that is supposed to be

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,460
you can set that in in seconds and you

00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,410
set it to zero it who it won't do

00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:40,040
anything it will just stay connected to

00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:43,880
whatever if it goes down it will it will

00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:46,100
stay disconnected so if for example if

00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,500
you set it to 30 seconds and every 30

00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:53,810
seconds it will go and check if we host

00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:57,350
this if the right host is is if it is

00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:59,810
connected to the right host and if not

00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:02,450
it will try to connect to the right host

00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:04,610
so in every event of failure for example

00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:07,970
if I'm connected if I'm an agent I'm

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:10,100
connected to to to do my primary post if

00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:14,750
it goes down I will move to the next one

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:19,190
and everything every 30 seconds I would

00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:23,410
go and check if if if the primary host

00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:28,689
this up imagine yourself up if yes

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:31,959
I'll connect to so this setting can be

00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:33,910
set on a cluster level and of course can

00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:36,569
be overwritten in the agent properties

00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:44,249
if you like to be specific for a

00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:46,779
particular host of course change chain

00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:49,479
making changes for the setting will not

00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:54,369
propagate in your blood and in any new

00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:58,179
last 44 the agents and yeah you don't

00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:59,339
need to restart my run circle to do

00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:04,509
syrup

00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:07,239
so yeah let's have a few slides in just

00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:10,649
to see basically how this fail fallback

00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:13,629
mechanism works so let's say that the

00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:16,629
KVM host is connected to management

00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:20,109
server a and it's preferred list is ABC

00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:23,319
so in every an event of this particular

00:10:20,109 --> 00:10:26,729
host days being unavailable for some

00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:30,519
reason it will simply switch back to the

00:10:26,729 --> 00:10:32,769
next management in the list in the

00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:36,159
preferred list and it will stay there

00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:38,729
and being there and every 30 seconds it

00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:43,359
will check if management service is up

00:10:38,729 --> 00:10:47,309
and if that comes up it will eventually

00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:47,309
move to the private one

00:10:47,609 --> 00:10:55,179
so yeah it's let's do a little bit demo

00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:57,509
about it you might think it works

00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:57,509
actually

00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:04,250
so I stopped the snow because I don't

00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,250
see anything come by screen

00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:16,690
so I'm connected to my phone over VPN to

00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:21,610
our lab in London so hopefully

00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:24,070
everything goes okay I have a pretty

00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:26,650
simple environment having three hosts

00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:30,839
and three management servers we can see

00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:34,380
that they are all up and running let's

00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,380
go on CD

00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:49,910
yeah so we have first a setting of

00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:53,779
static so basically by default it comes

00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:56,769
with check interval of zero which

00:11:53,779 --> 00:12:00,019
basically means disable feature and

00:11:56,769 --> 00:12:03,589
algorithm of static so in this case

00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:07,250
whatever we have in our in our post ball

00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:11,779
setting it will get propagated to all of

00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:18,140
the management of the K becomes right so

00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:23,000
let's do a little check yeah so this

00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:27,320
particular cost given three yes a lists

00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:33,260
defined the first one has 130 I hope you

00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:35,000
can see that by the way can you and you

00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,550
can see at the end of the line you have

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,589
like annotation or static that would

00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:42,649
make your life easier if you if you want

00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:45,410
to know what's going on there so if we

00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:48,459
do now and change this to round-robin

00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:48,459
for example

00:12:52,630 --> 00:13:04,329
okay that's not required actually no

00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:05,500
need to restart and if we try to you see

00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:08,190
what's happening here

00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:12,250
okay so we have a new list program unit

00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:14,829
134 130 133 and round 2 again

00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:18,279
so this means that this agent probably

00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:30,610
reconnected to 134 or if not it it will

00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:33,550
do it within 30 seconds and okay so if

00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:36,459
we try to like reproduce an event of

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:43,630
failure now if we go and shut down my

00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:49,389
ROM 134 now choose this one if you just

00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:51,819
go and stop it we can see that it's

00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:56,829
currently being disconnected from 1.0

00:13:51,819 --> 00:14:04,149
before and it's moved to the next one

00:13:56,829 --> 00:14:07,839
and in the list which is 130 so it's

00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:10,029
basically it was connected to to the to

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:14,139
its primary host the cost went down for

00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:16,930
some reason and that if it's jumped to

00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:19,750
the next one from the list it's pretty

00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:24,120
simple I mean itself trading sounds what

00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,120
sighs but yeah it's a simple solution

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:33,579
let's let's now put back 134 home let's

00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:39,430
just start it it's gonna take a couple

00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:41,769
of maybe a minute to start in the

00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:46,120
meantime you can see in the lock school

00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:52,240
if you can read it that every 30 seconds

00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:55,870
to check if if the primary connection is

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,160
up yeah eventually when it work when it

00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:03,110
comes up with you it just

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:10,990
have to let me so that's 134 it's not up

00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:10,990
yet it will come up in a second now

00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:16,000
okay we are house will be able to

00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,000
character

00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:36,740
so before 411 you got you could have

00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,330
seen when when the management server was

00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,630
loading he could have seen this page

00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:47,210
loading but because of we were headed

00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:49,850
this keeping all the files in one jar

00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:53,210
just one jar it uses some different

00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:54,950
libraries and now you can't see that in

00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:57,890
the background the management's actually

00:15:54,950 --> 00:16:07,180
rolling and it just displays that it is

00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:07,180
knowledgeable yeah okay yeah

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:24,739
yeah it's going up there you go

00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:28,429
so our management it's up and yeah I

00:16:24,739 --> 00:16:34,069
think we just connected to host 134 here

00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:37,610
in this line yeah so what happened

00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:39,139
it's it got connected to the primary

00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,759
codes so first it was connected to

00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:42,619
primary code then you shut down the

00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:44,439
primary costing move to the next one

00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:49,189
from the list as a fallback mechanism

00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:50,959
and it kept on trying to connect to its

00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:53,420
primary post and eventually won the

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:58,489
primary host went up it just moves back

00:16:53,420 --> 00:17:03,290
moved back to it and I think that's

00:16:58,489 --> 00:17:05,600
pretty much the feature so if you have

00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:08,149
any questions now you can you can ask

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:12,140
that's the QR code for a small survey

00:17:08,149 --> 00:17:15,199
that I pull up on Survey Monkey and it's

00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:17,089
just for questions like whether you like

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,539
the feature whether you would like to

00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:23,600
explore it to see what it what it is

00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:27,169
like and if you need that it's mature

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,450
enough that you can that you would like

00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:32,330
to use it in your environment just just

00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,340
a quick feedback for me if you like you

00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:36,100
can you can just scan at them turn to

00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:41,020
the sir yeah

00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:41,020
so a questions yeah Andrew

00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:26,670
so the question yeah question is if you

00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:28,800
if you do some overwriting the agent

00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:32,880
side will it get overwritten in time is

00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:36,060
that the wrong question so yes it gets

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,760
it gets overwritten if you change the

00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:41,340
list of management hosts if you

00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:46,800
reconnect the agent it also gets

00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:48,360
propagated again and yeah I think that's

00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,600
the of the cases that gets overwritten

00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:55,260
if you don't want to overwrite those you

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:57,240
can set the setting to static and it

00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:00,600
won't overwrite them at any good case

00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,250
but then you won't be able to use this

00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,800
feature

00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:06,780
yeah you used to can use it you can use

00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,860
the fallback mechanism but you have to

00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:13,800
use your own solution to do the agent

00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:16,970
side of configuration properly probably

00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,970
right lists for you

00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:48,800
I'm not 100% sure it's all the questions

00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:54,110
can you specify multiple management

00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:58,280
hosts before for that 411 I think you're

00:19:54,110 --> 00:20:00,260
not able to specify that and if you're

00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:04,870
gonna run clusters you need to setup

00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:04,870
your load balancer within that

00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,610
you

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,860
five

00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:39,780
that's a very good question so question

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:42,990
whisper yeah yeah so the just repeated

00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:45,930
if what happens if you have background

00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:48,300
drop warning at the Asian side and you

00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:52,800
want to at the same time jump jump to

00:20:48,300 --> 00:21:00,120
your primary connection right yeah yeah

00:20:52,800 --> 00:21:02,520
you want to switch base again it will

00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:05,340
try but the true first check if there's

00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,740
any running job at that post and if not

00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,410
it will then try but if there are still

00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:16,050
running job to wait until job is finish

00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:19,220
and we'll switch to imagine any other

00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:19,220
questions yeah

00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:33,510
drawback so a drawback for shuffle but

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,030
basically you are relying on a random

00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:38,390
list that's being generated for each

00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:41,190
hosts by the given list that you have

00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:43,590
the drawback could be that if you're

00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:47,370
running a large number of number of

00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:49,490
courses you can end up with multiple

00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:55,290
hosts being connected to one one point

00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:58,230
it's it it's a chance you know how it's

00:21:55,290 --> 00:22:09,290
random you have no guarantee that it

00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:12,200
will be a fairly good balanced all right

00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:17,589
thank you

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,589
