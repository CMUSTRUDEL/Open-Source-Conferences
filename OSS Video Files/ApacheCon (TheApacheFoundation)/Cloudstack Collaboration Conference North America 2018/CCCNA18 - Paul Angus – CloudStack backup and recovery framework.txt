I welcome to what has now become the

00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:13,009
pool Angus track and who say Dan wasn't

00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:15,860
able to travel he would have done a bit

00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:18,890
more of a developing developer focused

00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,720
talking but I've talked in the past

00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,400
about this I was able to pick it up and

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,840
still let you know about what we're

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:29,390
doing from my own kind of way

00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,580
so I've superimposed myself here over a

00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:35,059
darn I think that's pretty seamless you

00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:37,190
see it what's happening that if you were

00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:39,890
in the previous dog guild you kind of

00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:44,690
see them I'm still still here and still

00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:46,820
doing the same stuff as I was earlier so

00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:49,190
I'll start with a bit of a background to

00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:52,580
why we're doing this backup and recovery

00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:56,030
framework and then kind of rewind a bit

00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:58,339
back into snapshots explain why I'm

00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,540
talking about snapshots and then look at

00:00:58,339 --> 00:01:01,400
their framework

00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:05,390
why is my recording at frame locust

00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,770
sucks and what the framework does and

00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,220
how it's gonna do it what it's going to

00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:17,960
work with and then give a real example

00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:19,700
that's coming soon so people who've seen

00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,430
mailing list and have you'll know that

00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:26,300
anytime someone's popped up talking

00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:29,030
about any kind of backup or variant of

00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,950
snapshots I put my hand up and started

00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:34,040
writing stuff and trying to get people

00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:36,140
to to kind of break away from snapshots

00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,070
as backups and have something that

00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:45,170
really we would do the thing people want

00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:49,310
from a backup and today I happen to even

00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:51,350
a year ago wrote a wiki page in the pal

00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:53,290
stack to say these are the things I kind

00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,790
of think recovery

00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:57,340
mission in class that would need to

00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,710
cater to the kind of things I think that

00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:06,430
users will want to want from there

00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:08,290
at this kind of solution so that's

00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,950
that's kind of where partly where this

00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:12,130
came from

00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:14,170
also came from a customer demand one of

00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,630
our customers to again go through that

00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,520
list and work out does is this what your

00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,490
customers with one what do they need

00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:24,460
what are the drivers for them and for

00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:30,310
you as a as a consumer as a user of

00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:31,990
CloudStack to sell services so snapshots

00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,459
and well they've got a diverse in the

00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:37,480
first place what are you so upset about

00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:39,940
snapshots well the reason snapshots are

00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,790
going out coming up is because for most

00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:45,400
people they get used as a backup because

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:48,430
that is effectively the closest thing to

00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,590
a backup that cloud stack has available

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,660
in it that's native to clouds that way

00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,930
you're not installing your own agents

00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:58,870
and doing your anything and to give some

00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:01,030
background over that we have we talked

00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,910
about the virtual machine snapshot a VM

00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:06,940
snapshot and that's the more typical

00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,980
hypervisor snapshot that if you speak to

00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,810
anyone who's work with hypervisors and

00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,519
say snapshot that's what they're

00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,340
expecting you to mean where you take a

00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,950
point in time image of a running stop

00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,959
virtual machine and keep that honor

00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,760
probably next door and the close

00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:23,709
vicinity to the virtual machine that's

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,760
running and you can just roll back to

00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:31,959
that simply the exact mechanism depends

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,580
on the hypervisor CloudStack for a long

00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,160
time didn't actually have the VM

00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:40,660
snapshot piece it really did a volume

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:43,269
snapshot instead where it used that

00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,670
point in time got image but then copied

00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:47,830
it to secondary storage kept it there

00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:52,800
and people could roll

00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:56,320
- that kind of by creating VM from it

00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,600
but they had it moved away from the

00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,060
primary storage and that made them feel

00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,500
a lot more safe knowing it was somewhere

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:08,440
else there was another storage pool

00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:10,120
somewhere looking after this so when

00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,460
they looked at involving snapshots and

00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,130
why why they're getting used as backups

00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,750
we look at them and you say well they

00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,920
have an alternate storage location and

00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,299
that's the kind of first thing when

00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,049
you're taking a backup you wanted to go

00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:23,860
somewhere else

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:28,540
so if your primary storage blows up you

00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:30,280
can get your backup and also you can

00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,260
shed your they're boarding snapshots

00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,690
like you would a backup you can say I

00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:38,380
want them to be running free every day

00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:40,480
or once a week or twice a week you can

00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,630
set a retention policy which will say

00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,310
that your look your snapshot I'm going

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,230
to keep five of them and when I train

00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:52,060
new one I get rid of the last the

00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:54,100
earliest one and keep rolling along you

00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:57,070
can recreate the virtual machines from a

00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,960
snapshot image it's a bit of a pain and

00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,870
I'll show that in a second but it is

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,620
possible and you can explore the volume

00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,900
snapshots

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,270
out of the system so these are wrong

00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,980
things people have added because that

00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,870
snapshot for the closest we've got to

00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:16,300
backups and these are what people would

00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:18,220
want to do but then we come to the what

00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:22,810
so what's wrong with that that sounds

00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:24,880
all fine well you kind of get a bit of a

00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,040
problem that you're not going to be

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,830
consistent across volumes you'll be

00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,460
taking a backup of one volume and then

00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:35,080
another volume and then another body and

00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,030
everything kind of look so place okay

00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,100
until you look a little bit closer

00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,920
whoops

00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,400
until you look

00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,120
but closer at these things ago hang on a

00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,620
minute

00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,300
that's not quite right it's a bit dark

00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:55,820
on there but does anyone else think that

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:58,220
looks like Tin Man things get mixed up

00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,570
you don't get consistency but you might

00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,640
think you haven't you'll never know that

00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:06,680
it's not consistent until you try and

00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:09,230
use it again and even when you just take

00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,310
a snapshot of a single volume okay it's

00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:14,470
going to be crashed consistent okay but

00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,190
databases won't have been quest

00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,990
transaction logs won't have been

00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,760
processed all the kind of things you

00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:22,310
need to do if you've got a running

00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,920
application they're not really going to

00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:27,020
happen on a couple of the hyper advisors

00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,750
if you've got VMware tools or Zen tools

00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:31,400
they're going to are going to help you

00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,440
out a bit they're going to get to the

00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,960
some of the operating systems and try

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,540
and quiesce some stuff they'll relate to

00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:42,230
the system but the applications you've

00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:47,450
got on top and you've got no chance so

00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:50,540
it's not all no not safe basically there

00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:53,780
is the time old thing off it's just slow

00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,790
taking these snapshots and moving them

00:06:53,780 --> 00:07:00,590
to secondary storage has always been a

00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:02,300
bit of a problem in the case of VMware

00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:04,160
and sure a lot of people are using when

00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:07,550
they are worrying about back backups

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,380
we've got to compress this image into an

00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:11,210
OVA and then move that to secondary

00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,400
storage and that's taking up a load of

00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:17,390
bandwidth also a whole load of

00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:19,490
processing power to to do that and also

00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:22,010
cloud stats is what I'm doing this this

00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,320
this is backup now this

00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,550
snap shot long snap shot so I'm not

00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,900
gonna let them do anything else you know

00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,060
can't move this for you and you can't

00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:31,460
stop it you can do all sorts of things

00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,490
because for safety's sake just leave it

00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:36,530
alone while I'm doing my snapshot and if

00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:39,590
someone's got hundreds of gigabytes or

00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:44,660
larger disks this is gonna take a long

00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:46,220
time then you've got I talked about kind

00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,010
of restoring and they're being issues

00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:51,140
around restoring a vote for a scene so

00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,360
kind of natively unless someone's done

00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:56,920
extra integrations and clever stuff with

00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:00,410
their storage listen talking to me Mike

00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:04,340
you've got to take a snapshot and make a

00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:07,130
template from that snapshot so that

00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:10,250
first debt means that the data has to go

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:12,860
from your secondary storage see this via

00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,450
the secondary storage VM and then back

00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,340
into the secondary storage to be moved

00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:18,830
from normal patient to another and

00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:21,550
that's a lot of data movement for really

00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,870
just a copy or usually the same storage

00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:27,110
then you've got to create a virtual

00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:29,030
machine from that template well to do

00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:31,790
that he was going from your secondary

00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:34,760
storage and streaming the data all the

00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:37,340
way down to your primary storage you

00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,260
then convert that tell the hypervisor

00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,780
that's the template but then you create

00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,580
a new virtual machine from that template

00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:46,010
so now you're making a duplicate of what

00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,580
you've already done and if you look at

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:52,400
that you've probably moved the

00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:55,130
equivalent of five lots of that disk to

00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,750
create a virtual machine which super

00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:59,360
times come backwards and forwards and

00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:01,430
down copied there's a battler of

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,890
operations for something that just was

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:08,480
there before

00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:16,160
so that's why some of the reasons where

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:18,020
snapshots really far from optimal but

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,300
that's saying so we call this the backup

00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:23,089
and coverage framework and it is

00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:25,820
deliberately named like that because

00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:29,140
it's a framework it's not designed to do

00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:31,940
a backup and recovery for you in itself

00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:33,800
what it's designed to do is abstract all

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:37,220
the backup and recovery kind of

00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:39,710
operations that a user would expect and

00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:42,620
again that's why we worked with clients

00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:47,690
to define what users would expect

00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:51,170
require this abstracting knows from what

00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,640
the actual backup and recovery solution

00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:55,490
is doing there are Hardware ones that

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,400
the software runs is also us so we track

00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,529
ting that away so users just have a

00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,620
consistent thing that happens here and

00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:06,670
the back end of that is dealt with by a

00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:09,890
problem to actually drive those actions

00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:12,680
and it's vendor then of a backup

00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:15,290
solution can have their own plugin which

00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:18,080
basically then takes that generically

00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:19,850
named API to start a backup and then

00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,480
does whatever it needs to do to make

00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:25,490
that happen until Klaus that out what

00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,010
happened when it happened and all the

00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:29,690
things class that wants to know about it

00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:34,640
and then just to note there is a dummy

00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:36,560
plug-in as well for don't progestin so

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,120
there's the kind of said well the

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,500
framework doesn't really do very much

00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,589
but to kind of reiterate what it is

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:48,390
doing it's creating is a nice marketing

00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:50,910
any kind of vendor agnostic API

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:54,480
there will be UI in CloudStack for

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:57,180
people to have backup and recovery and

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,640
then whoever is operating the cloud to

00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,980
be able to choose the vendor that they

00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:05,250
want to actually drive that with that

00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:09,600
will give them the best experience as

00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:12,540
they say and that can be done in any way

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,190
as to give the SolidFire actually could

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,980
pretend to be in a lot of ways the

00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:19,680
backup solution it could move data

00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:22,320
around silently in the back and move

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,690
things off to another location and then

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,750
we could bring things back and it's all

00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:30,810
hidden behind just backup and top it

00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:33,810
back up in recovery rather than being

00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:36,350
kind of shoehorning and slightly bending

00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:40,380
cloud stack to its will it would be

00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:42,600
natively what people expect to happen so

00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:45,060
the cloud operator they're getting a

00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,310
much greater control over how backups

00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:49,830
happen and also sometimes when they're

00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:51,900
happening because this is all now could

00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:55,230
be accelerated we have a choice of

00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:58,170
hardware choice the software all of that

00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:01,820
can then be chosen so that it performs

00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:05,550
as well as it's physically possible I

00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:08,220
spoke about the process to restore a

00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:10,680
virtual machine and the bottom of there

00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,360
there was some providers say ok well

00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:18,060
actually all that moving the date of

00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:20,340
really a pain and it still ain't new

00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:22,350
virtual machine based on a template of a

00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:25,620
copy of the original virtual machine it

00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,880
isn't the original virtual machine a lot

00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,950
of stuff will have changed in there the

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,840
hardware has actually all changed it's

00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,830
just the image of the disc that's the

00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:36,300
same and a lot of things won't like that

00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:37,410
so they have to go through and pass

00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,570
through various different departments

00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,620
one department has to go to the store if

00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,050
you get the image another

00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,580
has to take that image and put it in

00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,960
this other bit of storage and really age

00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:49,200
with the customer when that's happening

00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,580
and another Department will be fiddling

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,340
with the class that database so it

00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:56,180
doesn't realize what's just happened so

00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:58,560
if there is a full backup and recovery

00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:02,790
architecture in there that all goes away

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:05,820
the user just says recover or I'll show

00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:07,470
you recover and the volume and attach it

00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:11,550
to another virtual machine and then I

00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:13,140
can just pull out what I want myself so

00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:15,210
they're offering a lot more features

00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:18,830
than two users without actually doing

00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:21,260
less work which is usually a good thing

00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:23,790
for the cloud consuming you've got this

00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,710
performance overhead improvement which

00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,540
is also good for the operator as well

00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:29,220
but the user is spending this time going

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:33,570
is that then finished yet I really want

00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:35,610
to get on with my life but they then get

00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,530
this feature set they expect to look at

00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:40,200
my current brochure you see all the

00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:42,000
things that it can do and they'll be

00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:46,130
able to see all all these things I can

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,130
do now I feel like I've got safe data

00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:51,600
you've got that consistency of our cloud

00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:57,240
stack API so all the things if you're if

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:59,010
where you are automating you can all to

00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,620
make that backup and the recovery as

00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:04,410
needed you can pull all that together

00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,910
it's still a single source of truth and

00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:09,270
it's still single pane of glass to

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:12,330
control stuff goes right through band if

00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:15,270
you like that kind of thing the fact

00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:18,720
that you know now okay my I've got this

00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:20,850
big brand of backup solution just

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,430
looking after my data I feel safe for

00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,650
now rather than

00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:27,020
that guy's telling me I'll return our

00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:28,040
secondary storage so isn't the secondary

00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:31,930
storage is the same as your primary

00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:34,370
storage so if one breaks they both break

00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:39,320
but you can say oh it's okay because

00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:42,950
it's all handled by insert name here so

00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:46,430
specifically the things that the backup

00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:50,900
recovery framework supports the idea of

00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:53,900
policy based backups that's a kind of

00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,640
relatively new idea or regurgitation of

00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,860
an online in fact where you have your

00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:00,410
restore point objective I don't want to

00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,000
lose more than eight hours work I don't

00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:03,890
want to lose more than a week's worth of

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,010
data or whatever it is

00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:09,620
if you kind of turn things around rather

00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:12,140
than as you know everyone wants to do

00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:15,080
their backup somewhere between 11:30 and

00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:19,160
night and 2:00 in the morning and their

00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:21,320
storage suddenly goes red-hot because in

00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,810
that time frame everyone is trying to

00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:27,230
move snapshots of their virtual machines

00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:29,030
to secondary storage if you turn it

00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:31,730
around and say I don't want to lose more

00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:33,770
than eight hours of data it doesn't

00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,690
matter and when that snapshots taken

00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:37,310
anymore

00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:41,540
also when that backups taken anymore and

00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:44,150
you can be can he as the cloud operator

00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:46,190
say okay well I'm gonna do some of the

00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,930
user one in the morning but then I'm

00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,790
gonna do some two and summer three and

00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:53,200
some of the forms and look live and as

00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:55,670
long as the next time this guy's VM is

00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,680
backed up again is within eight hours of

00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,390
the first type of us they're happy then

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,540
nobody's more Nass but I'm not doing

00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:04,340
them all at the same time so you can

00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,190
start getting kind of clever about that

00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,900
and you just offer a much simplified

00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:10,820
offering to the to the end user whether

00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,710
you just say this is gold offering it

00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,220
gets backed up and you won't lose more

00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:18,420
than eight hours

00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:21,540
data in the story that participant

00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:25,020
checked but obviously people still like

00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:27,090
to do scheduled backups so we're doing

00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:29,700
that in the same way as we did them

00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:32,190
before we're doing them as backups and

00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,840
same with ad hoc oh I really just want

00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,420
back that up before I start playing with

00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,670
that I'll just hit my backup button and

00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,460
off we go

00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:43,020
we'll have them as first-class citizens

00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,880
so that you do delete the virtual

00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,680
machine you haven't deleted the backups

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,780
you can go back and delete those in your

00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,550
chain but you still got them so you've

00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,260
got some kind of archiving if you like

00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,730
back the thing up and just leave it it's

00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:58,970
been moved off to some other kind of

00:16:53,730 --> 00:17:01,140
storage and just leave it there the

00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,330
restoration in place of taking the

00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:07,020
entire virtual machine and just putting

00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:08,820
it back as it was I mean obviously these

00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,190
are all just the kind of normal backup

00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,520
and recovery operations you expect

00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:17,000
really in that that's the point a

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,620
restoration of individual via volumes

00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,290
and then you've got the option you might

00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,820
want to just keep it put it in secondary

00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,860
storage and attach it to something at

00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:29,280
some point then you've got your copy of

00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:31,830
it or you might have said ah well that

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:35,930
that service blow but there was so much

00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:38,460
data let's get the backup of the data

00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:40,260
mounted in my new VM that I've created

00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,390
to do the same job and then I'll just

00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,160
copy the data across within the VM

00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:45,420
because that's going to be the fastest

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,640
way to move data from one place to

00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:50,700
another we can't do it any faster

00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,809
so you're attached the volume migrate

00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,029
the data within

00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:56,730
to himself and then obviously

00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:58,259
importantly for a lot of people is the

00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:01,289
proper integration to the class that

00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:03,360
uses service to be able to want charge

00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:05,999
or show people how much space they're

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,649
taking up allow how much money you will

00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:10,860
need to pay me for taking up that space

00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:14,730
and with that we'll record both will be

00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:18,809
people to protected data so I have five

00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:23,340
of one terabyte VMs well that's five

00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:26,369
terabytes I am protecting but also the

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:29,190
on data disk metrics which there's ok

00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:31,830
but actually I back to them up and they

00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:35,759
only got ten percent on them so that's

00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:39,240
500 gig and now it's doing incrementals

00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:43,529
so I'm actually only now using up seven

00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:46,440
hundred gigs of space for three months

00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:48,119
of backups or something and say well

00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,379
we'll charge you for the seven hundred

00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:52,559
get because that's the amount of space

00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:56,039
so in charging for the protected it

00:18:52,559 --> 00:19:01,169
dependent you work with but that those

00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:03,119
both will be there to choose from so now

00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:08,279
I can look at what the framework

00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:10,139
actually works with we can probably

00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:13,830
mostly ignore the dummy brothers at the

00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:17,820
moment the big one is V their backup and

00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:21,929
replication 9.5 specifically we've been

00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:25,340
working with it for VMware but that same

00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:28,889
application works for hyper-v as well

00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:31,110
although I've not tried it most actions

00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:33,690
because we're just telling them where

00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:34,980
the theme server what to do the theme

00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,840
plug-in is just connecting to that

00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,779
they're actually going to be the same

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,659
things so we say back that up and it's

00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:44,790
the same it's the restoration parts that

00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:47,430
if we get demand for

00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:49,310
hyper-v as well it's the restoration

00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:52,170
parts because they will be different

00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:54,600
they just will get restored to a

00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:57,290
different location we will have to be

00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:00,390
looking at SMB shares rather than

00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:01,830
whatever we would be with VMware so

00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:04,800
we'll have to work slightly differently

00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:07,040
on that but that is most of the work

00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:13,170
that is already there because we already

00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:15,870
downloaded the beam integration so to

00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:19,560
give some samples of this actual work

00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:23,970
here's our backup API so far it's only a

00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:25,590
few more to come we made while we're

00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:28,650
working with it we may change the names

00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:32,190
and change some bits around as we find

00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:35,040
that we do the next stage was our people

00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,840
stage doesn't quite fit it what we what

00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,460
we called it this just tweak that a

00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,290
little bit but basically the obvious

00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:43,140
things are creating Virtual Machine

00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:47,220
backups creating deleting that these

00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:49,980
policies that I talked about and then

00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:52,770
restoring volumes and restoring whole

00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:57,720
VMs so really the only things to be

00:20:52,770 --> 00:21:00,420
added in are the schedule and ad hoc so

00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:03,510
when don't kind of blend the two things

00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:05,670
here of the cloud stack site and this

00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:10,170
physical implementation that is actually

00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:12,810
there for V so we start off we've got

00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:15,860
these policies so we've said we're gonna

00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:17,940
have a policy that's created by the

00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:19,260
person running the cloud of people

00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,820
running Dell and they're going to say

00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,050
right there is this thing we're going to

00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:25,050
call it gold and it's going to backup

00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:27,950
once a day 24 hours everyone fails at

00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:32,050
some point it's always going to backup

00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:34,060
so in the vein world they have

00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:36,910
called jaws and we have to create a

00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:39,660
template to job that template includes

00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:42,250
stuff like it's backed up every 24 hours

00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:44,650
includes stuff like in this zone is

00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:47,620
backed up onto this particular storage

00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:50,770
which hopefully isn't a tape drive but

00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:52,900
is some nice big fat s3 bucket or

00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:55,110
something that there's running that's

00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:58,540
highly available and all secure

00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:00,670
replicated so you set that up as a

00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:02,890
template and we say right can you tell

00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:04,780
us what new jobs you have that might

00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:06,970
tell us the names you say write that one

00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:11,860
is the one I want to link to what I'm

00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:14,410
calling my gold policy class that says

00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:19,270
okay it treats that link simply in a

00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:22,240
database now we've got this cream VM

00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:25,360
backup so the name may change on that

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:28,680
and basically when we use the API

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:32,830
it links the virtual machine to the job

00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:34,960
now because of the way Veeam works the

00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,660
best thing to do here is clone that job

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,460
and make a new version of it give it had

00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:42,610
the name of our virtual machine in and

00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:44,740
put that virtual machine in that job so

00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:47,920
now I've got this new job which has all

00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:49,510
the properties of my template it's going

00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,970
to run every 24 hours it's going to put

00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:56,080
the data from it in this zone that

00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:57,970
storage and now it has this virtual

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,390
machine in it it's gonna just sit there

00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:03,930
doing its thing every 24 hours just

00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,930
backing up

00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:11,870
with ad-hoc and scheduled backups will

00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:14,000
have that job and but Klaus that will

00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:16,039
say on its on its scheduled as the same

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,840
way as it does with snapshots and I said

00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:21,259
you were to say write another backup

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,000
please send that to the V plugin plugin

00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:26,179
sends it to ravine server

00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,710
and take that job and start it up and it

00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:30,919
starts it on the schedule that's already

00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:34,159
been stored in cloud stack and then

00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:35,929
obviously ad hoc is sent in press the

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:39,950
bottom it just fires the command to

00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:42,529
start that job so we've got that kind of

00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:45,200
very simple way of now seeing that job

00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:46,669
as being how we run it when we run it

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,230
and what it's going to do when it's

00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:54,200
wrong obviously from class that side

00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:56,120
that's all very well but what was V maps

00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,190
and what did it do wasn't been doing for

00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,500
the last couple of weeks months with my

00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:03,080
backups well obviously we want to list

00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,149
all those jobs for the backup VM is

00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,120
basically what cloud

00:24:05,149 --> 00:24:10,159
bean called restore points and again

00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:13,460
this is we've kind of bled slightly a

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:16,190
bean thing into our API and we will

00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,269
probably will look at that as time goes

00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,950
on and look at a whole load of other

00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:21,740
vendors and say do they call those

00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:24,379
restore points and if they do then store

00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,940
points can stay most of you don't we

00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,889
need to find a term that will

00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:30,799
generically work across the board and

00:24:27,889 --> 00:24:33,580
not confuse people because Veeam have

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,870
this thing of backups being jobs and

00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,940
actual backups running being store

00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:43,009
points and in fact it doesn't have

00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:46,129
backup anywhere so we will make sure we

00:24:43,009 --> 00:24:48,740
have a good consistent API API naming

00:24:46,129 --> 00:24:51,169
that will then work for the keep going

00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:53,820
on about being the rubric and convo

00:24:51,169 --> 00:25:00,120
whoever else wants to come along

00:24:53,820 --> 00:25:01,470
half a plug in work last time so yeah we

00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,930
can list a lot of still points we can

00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:05,460
see well mark virtual machines and we

00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:08,640
can see all the times they've been

00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:10,590
backed up and obviously we've also got

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,810
the usage to know how much space that

00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:17,160
Virtual Machine backup is taking up

00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:19,050
there over time one of the things we

00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:23,570
kind of had to work around with routine

00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:27,060
is that when they say in place restore

00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:29,670
what they really mean is in place of

00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:32,610
that virtual machine you have the back

00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:35,730
the restored one not in the same place

00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:37,590
as that over commercial so it doesn't

00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:39,420
right over the top of the original

00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:41,940
virtual machine actually creates another

00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:43,380
one we named it to be the same name as

00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,770
the foot the original and gets rid of

00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:48,960
the dead promise you like the one we

00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:50,520
don't want anymore assuming it was there

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,900
if it wasn't there because it been

00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,540
destroyed and you've gone to the backup

00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:56,970
to get it back then it still was

00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:00,630
creating it and to kind of work with

00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:03,090
that we've had to implement extra stuff

00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:06,330
in class stack to go find a VM that's

00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:10,470
been created and you make it appear in

00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:12,990
cloud stack that work we're going to

00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:15,200
then build on that economy because it's

00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:17,400
basically what you want to do in

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,500
disaster recovery when you're bringing

00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:23,190
stuff back in a new zone it's also what

00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:25,230
you want to do when you're onboarding

00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:27,360
customer to be able to say look at all

00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:29,730
those VN I want them to class day and

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,650
rather than having to great templates

00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,960
from them and then spin up a new VM

00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:36,630
which as I said isn't the same thing as

00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,520
the VM and there's a lot of data around

00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:42,270
we just say cloud stack update yourself

00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:44,310
to know this VM there just just do it

00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:46,060
and to do that we need to be able to

00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:48,100
change MAC addresses and things

00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:49,720
also set MAC addresses and then Pat

00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,790
Nixon but just put them into the

00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,570
database without creating the things in

00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:55,180
the first place

00:26:52,570 --> 00:27:00,280
so that's also another avenue that then

00:26:55,180 --> 00:27:01,870
follows on from from this work and then

00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,090
the other thing when you're restoring

00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:06,460
the volume is we can attach it to an

00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:08,830
existing virtual machine so either you

00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:13,000
spam specifically for the job of getting

00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:14,410
the data or as I suggested earlier a lot

00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,110
of people who might take a database

00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:19,000
really build a super server and then

00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:21,640
basically just copy the data from the

00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,740
backup into their new secret server

00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,200
rather than trying to rebuild the old

00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:28,180
one in streaming over network back to

00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:31,030
where came to it's much quicker to

00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:37,390
physically mount that disk on the new

00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:40,840
virtual machines going to use think I

00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:43,090
said of that yeah so one of the

00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,070
advantages of again we doing it the way

00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:46,810
we have with these individual jobs is

00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:48,940
also the accounting and being able to

00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:50,440
see of this one job this is in our space

00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:53,710
that's taking up these are all the

00:27:50,440 --> 00:28:00,220
backups the store points have been

00:27:53,710 --> 00:28:02,260
created nearly there okay so where is it

00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:09,370
because it's all kind of nice but what's

00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:12,130
going on so you expect to have PR

00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:14,620
appearing for too much all of it

00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:18,520
with the exception of the UI sometime

00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:21,040
soon kid quarter for said those api's I

00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,779
show have been done I do exist we've got

00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,779
you know

00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:27,629
Brants all those commands where you

00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:31,859
create backups and get them back and

00:28:27,629 --> 00:28:35,119
restore all done it all works which is

00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:36,960
got to add in the scheduling to ad hoc

00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:39,210
probably everything people are going to

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,519
want to change the underlying policy

00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:43,559
without deleting all the backups they've

00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,830
taken so they want to go from oh I was

00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:49,320
backing up once every 24 hours actually

00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:51,330
turns out only one doing every week but

00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,619
I don't lose all the backup eastery I

00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:56,429
had I just want to switch the kind of

00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:57,749
policy so I'm gonna add that in and I'm

00:28:56,429 --> 00:29:00,779
going and saying actually right now

00:28:57,749 --> 00:29:03,330
delete all that stuff done at the end I

00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:05,009
don't know whether the VM anymore I

00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:07,879
don't care about the backups just delete

00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,879
everything for me please

00:29:08,249 --> 00:29:14,940
DUI who's obviously gonna be very

00:29:11,909 --> 00:29:17,669
important to a lot of people that women

00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:19,589
study work on that respect out how long

00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:21,599
how long we think it's going to take so

00:29:19,589 --> 00:29:24,089
probably hope hopefully by the end of

00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:27,450
the year we'll start seeing the UI come

00:29:24,089 --> 00:29:29,279
in as well obviously trying to avoid the

00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,899
world's biggest bike shed over exactly

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,739
what button should be where or it should

00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:36,149
be called intuitive it should look like

00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:38,519
but we've got kind of a lot of obviously

00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:40,409
framework of previous what a lot of

00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:42,450
stuff looks like in cloud stack so we're

00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:48,600
just a lot of people just

00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:50,850
is copy paste so any questions on backup

00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,460
and recovery you say it it is a real

00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:56,840
thing it does work and do it becoming

00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,840
properly in soon

00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:23,240
what I get them well if you can find if

00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:29,510
you can find a vendor that does

00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:30,830
XenServer back up and actually the guys

00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:33,799
from xcp

00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:37,600
ng about and part of there's an

00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:41,360
Orchestrator does that and we have

00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,100
talked to a meet up last week I think I

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,640
said okay that could be interesting as a

00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:49,520
tie up to $1 you we're gonna actually be

00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:54,440
ng with their backup and we will drive

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:56,090
that from down stack there is an

00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,650
interesting company called Vinci you

00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:59,030
know again email from every other day I

00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:04,010
think at the moment trying to sell me

00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:06,710
back on recovery they do seem to support

00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:10,160
quite a broad Church although I think

00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:14,330
they talk about supporting Zen rather

00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:18,860
than the XenServer and I think they use

00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:23,360
a lot of the red hat overt stuff but I

00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:27,530
was talking to some guys from ena who

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:32,450
are doing a load of stuff with over

00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:34,669
so that's KTM they are they do list the

00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:36,890
Zen at least it's not Zen server in

00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:40,130
their offerings for for vengeance I

00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:43,250
speak to them as well so yeah the idea

00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:45,830
is is anyone couldn't I cried and I said

00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:49,030
I think like a lot of the features you

00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:52,400
have for SolidFire for XenServer kind of

00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:55,970
cook map to those things and give you

00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:59,179
the off site off off store region what

00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:02,270
have you I say it kind of then gives

00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:04,220
people the bottom they expect to do and

00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:06,740
does the things they expect it to do how

00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:09,460
that happens in the back end it really

00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,460
doesn't matter

00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,170
Oh

00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:20,359
but how does these women

00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:31,250
you have a lot of choices with being the

00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:33,919
way you wanted to put it so they have a

00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:43,370
obviously this old-fashioned tape

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:46,909
there's other storage there's s3 yeah

00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:49,510
so you just define hey I got a load of

00:32:46,909 --> 00:32:54,470
storage there that's what I wanted to go

00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:57,860
yeah so cloud stack is just going right

00:32:54,470 --> 00:33:01,340
you asked me to do a backup I'm telling

00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:04,370
them to do a backup so however you knew

00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:06,769
Ramdeen want to run V decide to run V

00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:10,490
that's you do what you like but yeah

00:33:06,769 --> 00:33:12,559
it's not there's no necessity to go back

00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:15,919
up to Klaus that stuff at all it's it's

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:17,450
only thing I guess you could use the

00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:21,649
same a right second who storage array

00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:27,679
somewhere but there's no need to invent

00:33:21,649 --> 00:33:30,580
it cool so just to reiterate we this

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,659
