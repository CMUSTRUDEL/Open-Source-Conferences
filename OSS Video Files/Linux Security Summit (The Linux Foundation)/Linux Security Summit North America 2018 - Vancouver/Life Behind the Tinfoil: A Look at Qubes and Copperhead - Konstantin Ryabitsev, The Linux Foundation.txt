Description: 
	Life Behind the Tinfoil: A Look at Qubes and Copperhead - Konstantin Ryabitsev, The Linux Foundation

Konstantin Ryabitsev shares his day-to-day experience using QubesOS on his primary workstation and CopperheadOS on his smartphone. What are the impacts of using products promising higher security and higher privacy? How well do Qubes and Copperhead measure up to those promises? What kind of trade-offs are expected from someone coming from run-of-the-mill Linux and Android platforms? Are these trade-offs worth it?

	00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:08,429
okay good morning welcome to day two I

00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,750
I just have a an update on the slides I

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,630
was giving out some outdated information

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,940
yesterday so four speakers you are meant

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,980
to email it or not upload to shared even

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,230
though you can and the slides will

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,470
appear there's a drop down link in the

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,820
on the on the website and just says

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,880
slide so they're all there in one place

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:30,230
so sorry for the the wrong information

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,450
so our first talk this morning is

00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:36,180
someone who works for the Linux

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,059
Foundation on the Gipp servers and other

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,360
other parts of the infrastructure

00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:43,860
constant in rehab it's serve and he'll

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,270
be talking on cubes and probably

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:53,850
something interesting I'm guessing about

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:55,920
copper here OS all right thank you for

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,960
coming I know it is an amazing morning

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,489
out there and I really appreciate that

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,250
you guys traded it off for me

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,750
it says a lot I haven't had any coffee

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,140
because they didn't bring any because

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,990
it's running a pure adrenaline which is

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,220
good you know they always yeah maybe

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,060
I'll bring it later but they always

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,490
ignore security people until last moment

00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:20,880
observation so we're going to talk about

00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:22,530
cubes OS and Copperhead OS today we'll

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,659
cover the following topics you know why

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,369
did they do this to myself if you were

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,080
here earlier you saw me try to make it

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,210
work I had to switch to a different

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,700
window manager just to make it work

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,799
cubes OS will cover and Copperhead OS

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,979
I'll go into it in some detail not too

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,680
much because you'll see

00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:43,539
I'll go discuss the guiding principles

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,930
for our behind Cuba's OS and Copperhead

00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:48,880
OS I will go through device requirements

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,100
give a very brief look at how what it

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,990
takes to install it and what daily uses

00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,899
like--that's aspect that I'll cover most

00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:58,090
cuz probably interested here how it is

00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:59,470
it like to actually do your work and

00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,990
live your life under cubes in Lesson

00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:04,210
Copperhead and what you will like what

00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:06,460
it will drive you mad and convenience

00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:08,649
and security trade-offs and logo for the

00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,590
future outlook or like their offer for

00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:13,390
each of the options please interrupt at

00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,220
any time just yell question at me I'll

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,959
repeat it to everybody to hear so this

00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,340
will be a lot faster cuz I know it's

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,290
hard sometimes to remember what you were

00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,489
going to ask until the very moment so

00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,739
please see the free raise your hand and

00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:24,819
ask a question and I will answer it

00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:28,269
because this way it's right and

00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:31,060
everybody's mind about me I'm a

00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:32,829
professional Russian hacker I was one

00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,220
before it was popular so you've never

00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:40,030
probably heard of me the lack of accent

00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:42,310
is the sign of professionalism Linux on

00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,769
the desktop user since 1998 maybe

00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:48,250
actually 1999 that I think about it I

00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:51,280
installed a Red Hat Linux 6.0 and it's

00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:54,940
perience the joys of you know point 1.0

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,000
and KDE 1.0 asked me about kora Linux or

00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,799
actually don't because it's not a member

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,850
of lennox foundation team since IT team

00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:03,489
since 2011

00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:07,269
I've been running cubes OS on my main

00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:09,760
work station since to August 2016 so it

00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:12,609
gives me good two-year run on the cubes

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,950
OS it wasn't a just an experiment I can

00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:16,720
go into kitchen you're using it as my

00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,310
daily workstation

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,910
I've been riding Copperhead OS since

00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:25,150
September 2017 so last year I stopped

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:27,130
running it in June 2018 you will see why

00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:31,389
and I hope to go back at some point

00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:32,920
maybe that's there's a caveat there so

00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:34,569
there's a caveat I'm a system

00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,290
administrator I'm not a security

00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:37,180
researcher

00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,639
I'm not a kernel developer I know you

00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,200
guys like watching yeah you don't you

00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:42,910
run kernel notorious but you know

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,530
running kernel network is very different

00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,329
than working on the Linux kernel I

00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,829
usually say the difference is like

00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:49,659
kernel developers are like heart

00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:52,150
surgeons and system insiders are like

00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:52,819
plumbers you know down at some point

00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,909
there it's all about

00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:57,349
pipes and gravity and bumps but you

00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:59,239
don't want your heart surgeons doing

00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:00,469
your plumbing as well you know you don't

00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,689
want your plumbers doing your heart

00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:05,510
surgery they're both important I'm not

00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:06,650
trying to say that kernel developers are

00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:11,180
so much better than we are because

00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:13,069
they're not I'm a bit paranoid miss this

00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,510
some people asking why do you do this to

00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:16,459
yourself and like I'm a little bit

00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:20,329
paranoid I'm not nearly as paranoid as

00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:23,270
some people are so this is it's an easy

00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:26,120
caveat say my goal here is to share my

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,770
experience using Linux based tools that

00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,220
significantly improve my security and

00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:32,690
privacy because if you look if you're if

00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,009
you have a asks of a question how can I

00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:37,130
significantly improve my security and

00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:39,560
privacy the top answer is going to be

00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:42,800
run cubes OS and install a an Android

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:46,610
device that is not tied to the Google

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,320
mothership so we'll start by looking at

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,880
cubes OS and first of course why did I

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,620
do this to myself so I'm a system

00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,979
administrator as I said it is it is

00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:57,590
important from a to the security of my

00:04:54,979 --> 00:05:00,970
workstation and the data that I have on

00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:04,610
my workstation gives access to a lot of

00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:07,669
Secrets that some other entities might

00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:10,159
want to get their hands off on as I just

00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:12,259
my encryption keys such as my as SH Keys

00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:14,479
PGP keys and so forth I am the

00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:16,340
gatekeeper to some things like creating

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,690
current literal accounts and so forth it

00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,300
was very interested it was very

00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:22,159
important for me to have a workstation

00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,590
environment where I can be fairly

00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:28,159
certain that compromising it would take

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:30,710
significant amount of effort by the way

00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:34,449
if you don't know that is habitat 67

00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:38,719
which is a building in Montreal it is

00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:41,090
was built by for Expo 67 and it was an

00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:43,460
attempt by the architecture to reimagine

00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:46,310
how it would be to have a high density

00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:49,250
housing but without the boxy look it is

00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:51,380
very brutalist in nature it is very hard

00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,259
to miss if here in Montreal port and it

00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:57,860
ultimately failed because nobody ended

00:05:54,259 --> 00:06:01,970
up building high density housing in that

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:04,970
way maybe there is a matter for there

00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:07,400
so cubes OS guiding principles it does

00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:09,050
compartment is a ssin via virtualization

00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,310
what is what does that mean it's that

00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,190
everything that's running on your

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,820
workstation it runs in a some sort of a

00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:19,100
VM it is a type 1 hypervisor using them

00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:21,290
it the dom0 is the privileged VM that

00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,270
runs on your new workstation

00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:28,250
it runs the actual graphical interface

00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:30,100
and it draws decorators around every

00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,780
window which indicates from which

00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,760
workspace it came from aren't they I'm

00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,990
running two workspaces that invisible

00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,740
there is a purple one that's called

00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:42,290
chatter which I use for all the web and

00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:44,480
IRC and slack and so forth and there is

00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:48,200
a work VM that I only use for basically

00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:50,480
SS aging around and the pork VM is

00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,760
covered there is a title work in there

00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,370
and there's a very distinct blue border

00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,590
and the chatter VM has a purple border

00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:01,310
and very distinct word chatter in there

00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:05,050
it is theoretically impossible to fake

00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:07,520
those using the in the cubes environment

00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,290
so as I mentioned all applications run

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,860
inside their workspaces inside what they

00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:16,250
call app VMs it also provides hardware

00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:18,980
isolation I owe all IO devices must be

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:22,340
assigned to a VM before they used there

00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:25,660
is a special USB VM that is it's called

00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:28,450
sis USB that is completely isolated from

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:30,830
the rest of the system it's the

00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:35,810
controller is assigned directly to it

00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:38,030
Xen controls that controller and if you

00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:40,610
wanted to use that device in any other

00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,440
VM you have to specifically assign it to

00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,580
it

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,680
there are convenient management tools to

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,910
do it when you insert a USB device for

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,120
example there will be a pop up saying

00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:51,950
that a USB devices available there is I

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,200
won't just right now cuz it's fullscreen

00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,460
there is a little icon that says they

00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,169
can click and it will show you all the

00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,570
devices that are available you can say

00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:01,580
attach this device to the following VM

00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:03,320
and then you can use that device in at

00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:06,200
the app if you are lucky sometimes it

00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,370
doesn't work so convenient management

00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,320
tools that's what I meant that's what I

00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,460
mean by that Wow I've also go into some

00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,070
of the details about what the other

00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,700
convenient tools are it also provides a

00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,770
network isolation

00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:19,590
you have full control over how your VMs

00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:21,720
get online or not at all four volt EMS

00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,140
or USB DMS I can demonstrate it right

00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,750
here

00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:28,020
I have chatter VM goes out through over

00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:31,470
via and Maul dad VPN client and work

00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:33,120
connects directly if I curl the IP

00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,610
address you see that the this is the

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,050
mall that IP address recalled Allen

00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,300
that's the direct IP address that I got

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:42,630
connecting here so all applications that

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:45,600
will be opened in the chatter at VM will

00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:47,460
be accessing the Internet via the Open

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,620
VPN connection I can additionally use

00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:52,050
things like tour if I wanted to I can

00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:55,290
also have multiple VPN clients one for

00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:57,510
work one for untrusted connections I

00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,010
have a random malvit client that

00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:02,220
connects to a random endpoint and

00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:04,530
sometimes I get a weird experience of

00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,660
watching Google results in very strange

00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:08,340
languages pop up on my screen because

00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:12,780
they try to guess what I speak by like

00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:15,000
my location but that's a very good perk

00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,950
so what a device requirements of running

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,880
cubes OS it requires lots of RAM

00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:23,370
obviously you are running most of the

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,620
time on my workstation I run about ten

00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,810
at VMs so each one of them uses from

00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,970
anywhere from one to four gigabytes of

00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:32,160
RAM so on their website you will see

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,410
they say four plus gigabytes of RAM that

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,170
is a lie you may be able to boot it and

00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:39,030
start one VM on four gigabytes of RAM

00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:41,130
but you will not be a happy camper

00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:43,380
because if you are anything like me you

00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:45,570
will have at least five Firefox

00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,760
processes running running and if you

00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,860
know what Firefox oh my god chromium

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,720
processes are like he will understand

00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,210
that running any more than one requires

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,700
more than eight or preferably more than

00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,830
sixteen gigabytes of RAM on my

00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,440
workstation I have 24 that seems to be a

00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:03,720
very good comfortable number

00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,180
it requires fast large SSD disks because

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,770
obviously if you're starting it from

00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,360
studying processes from different VMs

00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:11,520
you don't benefit from any of the

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:16,650
caching that the processor gives you

00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:21,270
they will be all read cold from the disk

00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:25,100
it also requires for all the other D

00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:28,649
decorations inside each of the IBM's

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:31,430
sometimes so you also require fastest

00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:33,720
discs and nvme is the best choice here

00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:37,439
it requires multiple processors with

00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,540
many cores but this laptop is to

00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:41,430
processors two cores on each so this is

00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,649
actually fairly comfortable life if

00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:46,709
you're not doing anything super crazy on

00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:48,929
my workstation I have 4 by 8 4 by 4 mm

00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:50,309
which it is and that's that seems to be

00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:54,179
convenient and comfortable for my use

00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:57,329
from the CPU for cubes 4.0 the CPU must

00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:59,579
have both VTX and vtd if you do not have

00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:01,110
vtd sometimes processors will not have

00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:03,389
that enable or available at all you will

00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,249
not be able to run cubes OS at all

00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:07,679
keep zest version for version 3.2

00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:13,889
supported processes without BTD the our

00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:16,949
IMO in AMD parlance but the the 4 point

00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:20,009
note is does not support that at all and

00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:21,779
it also if you can it doesn't require

00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:23,069
Intel graphics but your my life will be

00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:24,449
so much simpler if you have Intel

00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:26,550
graphics you may have some other it's

00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:27,720
something else but your life will be so

00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,829
much more complicated and believe me

00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,629
your life is already going to be

00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:32,009
complicated so you don't want to make it

00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:34,949
any more complicated by picking a

00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:39,029
different graphics card so what's the

00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:40,860
installation like it's a so cubes OS is

00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:42,420
built on top of fedora so if you've ever

00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,949
installed Fedora you will be comfortable

00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,769
and Stelling cubes OS it's a modified

00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:48,120
Fedora installer post installation

00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:50,610
requires knowledge of what you're doing

00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,110
before you do it unless you just messing

00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,490
around he can probably accept most of

00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,769
the defaults but you have to make

00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:58,050
decisions that will affect how you're

00:11:55,769 --> 00:12:01,319
gonna go about your day to day life is

00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:03,029
this su CSB do you use that for your USB

00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:05,339
devices so they go there's an option

00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:07,740
also to use your cisnet this means also

00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:09,660
that if you use the snap it's that's the

00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,949
VM that connects to the network that any

00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,899
advice that you plug in directly into

00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:14,279
your laptop will be immediately able to

00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,279
go out into the network so that's

00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:18,870
something that you may not want to do

00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:20,249
which USB controller to assign it to for

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,459
laptops that's easy you can just sign

00:12:20,249 --> 00:12:25,350
all USB controllers to the to this sis

00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:27,209
USB if you have a workstation like a

00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:29,279
Dell workstation if you do decide to

00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:31,199
assign your sis your USB controllers to

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,660
the VM and you're using USB keyboard and

00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:35,279
mouse guess what happens you are no

00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:38,009
longer able to use your system at all

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,059
and you have to reinstall that's what

00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:42,209
happened to me when I first installed

00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:42,570
keep the lesson do you create regular

00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:44,520
app

00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,590
there gives you a default option of

00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,210
creating a work and a personal and volt

00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,950
and untrusted and those are good good

00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:54,600
sane defaults so if you want to do that

00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:56,430
I I suggest you do so what are the at VM

00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,530
so you have to think about them in terms

00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,610
of isolated logical workspaces you don't

00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,830
you shouldn't think that you have to

00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,780
create an app VM and around each

00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:05,490
application inside a separate app VM you

00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,320
can do it it's it's a complete total

00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:09,570
overkill you have to really think them

00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,250
of them in terms of separate physical

00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:14,580
work stations that you would normally be

00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:16,470
doing your work end the best metaphor to

00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:20,190
think about cubes OS is you're running

00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:21,870
multiple full isolated hardware systems

00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,400
that you have a convenient mechanism of

00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,800
copy pasting and copying files between

00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,540
so if you're doing all your work and you

00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,460
need to run a work browser and the work

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,020
term terminal and any other stuff that

00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,520
need to do for work you can run it

00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,960
inside a work via if you're doing

00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,030
something personal you can the resident

00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,400
personal VM if you go out and do

00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:40,710
something questionable and the internet

00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,710
we can write an untrusted VM that goes

00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:48,990
out through tor connection or a fully

00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:50,790
randomized VPN endpoint you have to have

00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,830
an option else of using disposable VMs

00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,690
so one of the cool things about cubes is

00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:57,420
that everything is powered by template

00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:59,900
VMs so in template VM is the actual

00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,490
image that your VMs will be using and

00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,890
when you bring up a disposable VM it

00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:08,750
just gives you a throw away everything

00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:11,940
so you start a completely blank just

00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:13,560
installed system you do anything you

00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,330
need to do like open a questionable file

00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,590
or access a questionable site if you

00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,360
wanted to look at the source and figure

00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:20,280
out what's doing and so forth you can

00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,310
then shut down the disposable VM it will

00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:25,200
completely destroy everything that that

00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:29,610
that that activity has left in terms of

00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:31,800
traces on that vm system so templates

00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,990
you have to learn how they work you have

00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:38,130
to think in the framework of system of

00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:40,200
templates there is a /rw and slash home

00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:42,690
and slash user local that are writable

00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,790
on your app vm every every other

00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:46,350
location by default is not a while it is

00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:49,230
writable but it will be thrown away

00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:51,630
after you restart that app VM which is a

00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:53,760
cool thing if you have a compromised

00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,760
that means you're just rebooting will

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,920
usually erase all of the

00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,600
aniss that a compromise is left don't

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,070
rely on this because obviously if they

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,120
are smart enough they will not be riding

00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:07,160
into those locations there are community

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,600
templates available Fedora Debian and

00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,150
onyx if you don't know what honex is

00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,660
that's a basically a way to do

00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:17,770
persistent tor connections at or

00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,770
browsing on the Internet

00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,340
and this is my screenshot of what I

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,400
usually have on my workstation out of

00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:27,110
this laptop I have a chatter as I

00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,880
mentioned there's a personal one that

00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,330
used for personal things and personal

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,310
websites

00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:33,530
it says firewall is basically a

00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:35,990
dedicated VM that just does packet

00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:37,970
filtering there is a smell that Canada

00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:39,500
that's a used for non questionable

00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,950
connections for going out to the

00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,540
Internet

00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,820
it's a small but random is the random

00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,950
end point as I mentioned cisnet is the

00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,630
one where the network card is assigned

00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,890
to and that's the only VM that is

00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:52,850
actually able to control the network

00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:57,050
cards wireless or your Hardware wired

00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:58,520
card there is an untrusted that usually

00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,770
connected through the random end point

00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,210
there's a volt VM volt VM does not have

00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:05,230
any network connections to it which is a

00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:07,660
good VM for storing sensitive files or

00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:09,800
something like your password database

00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:13,940
all right a work one that's that's

00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:15,680
usually I use for only assess aging so

00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:18,050
what's the daily daily use like four

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,400
cubes for the most part everything just

00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,380
works as expected you have applications

00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,120
they behave as they normally would you

00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,580
can click your point you start new ones

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,710
you you shut them down everything is

00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:31,400
just like you would be expected on any

00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:34,400
other Linux system except obviously

00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,530
copying files is more complicated if you

00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:40,190
have to copy files between two up the MS

00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:44,600
you have to you either use a command

00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:46,310
line that's called copy key VM copy that

00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,960
gives you a dialogue saying - which VM

00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,730
would you like to copy it to and this is

00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,930
actually get used to it very quickly and

00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,340
also you can do it through a graphical

00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,710
interface and right-click in the files

00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:56,360
manager you can say send this to that VM

00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:58,430
you can move it or copy or anything and

00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:02,090
they are placed in a specially special

00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:06,860
incoming directory on the target VM copy

00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:09,650
pasting on the other hand is will drive

00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:14,300
you crazy and it is not because it is

00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:17,059
it works as designed and so ctrl-c

00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,829
ctrl-v any other operation will

00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:20,809
obviously there is a cop there's a

00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,400
clipboard client inside each of the VM

00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:25,309
so it will copy only into the clipboard

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,680
in that VM you can then send it to the

00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:30,470
global VM to the global clipboard and

00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,450
send that clipboard to the other VM but

00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:34,400
oh my god this you will always forget to

00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:36,410
do this if you've trained at spent

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,850
30-years control-c control-v and not

00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:39,920
learning that and relearning everything

00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,720
else is just the most complex thing I've

00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,070
done and what you probably end up doing

00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,330
most of the time is just pasting

00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,160
completely random things there were

00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,870
somewhere from yesterday in your

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,550
clipboard because you forgot to send the

00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:51,800
thing from that other VM into there

00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:53,630
anyway it drives you crazy it is up it's

00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,340
not broken it's just how it's supposed

00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:58,670
to be you you in a secure system you

00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:02,300
don't want an untrusted VM to be able to

00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:05,350
override your global clipboard but it's

00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:08,120
just one of those things that is the

00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:10,370
worst possible ever when you do it wrong

00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,170
because then you just yeah I've I've

00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:15,100
discovered I know so many things from

00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:18,050
any different languages of cursing

00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,760
installing software via DNF and apt it

00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:22,280
has to be done through a template VM so

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,970
you can't do it in running app VM so if

00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:29,059
you start my work VM and I install an a

00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:30,440
package that I have not had before I can

00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:32,120
install and use it at that point if I

00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,570
shut down the work VM and every started

00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,850
again

00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,410
it goes back to what my template VM

00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:38,630
looked like so if you want to use an

00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:40,190
application that you know you'll use on

00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,690
a daily basis you have to install it in

00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,309
a template VM and then they will be

00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:45,770
available to all the app VM is using

00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:48,320
that template and the same thing goes

00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:50,570
for config global configuration files if

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,309
you have to use something like a

00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:55,610
Kerberos client and you need to set up

00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:59,240
at c-curve dr5 conf and then you have to

00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:01,280
do it in a template vm or on each boot

00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,230
you have to copy that file into the

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:07,010
proper location on your app vm there is

00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:09,020
a way of doing this via an RC file what

00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:10,880
I usually do is I have a sim links for

00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:13,610
those things so I don't you don't want

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,080
to put the herpers configuration in

00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,550
other sensitive files into template

00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:21,260
because then they'll be available to all

00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:22,700
the VMS so what you love about cubes VM

00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,680
cubes OS

00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,060
you do get the feeling that you after

00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,710
you've jumped through so many hoops that

00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:31,130
you have protected you've done your best

00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:33,260
protecting your data it is a very two

00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:35,150
people who created cubes OS and who

00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,830
write cubes OSI extremely clever and a

00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:41,150
very bright and they're awesome people

00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:42,800
who are I know have security at their

00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,720
heart they really are they really

00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,660
thought about many things and some

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,890
things I haven't even thought about

00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:52,280
people love being able to opal mate mate

00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:53,750
mail attachments and disposable VMs if

00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,090
you've received something say hey I'll

00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,260
take a look at this you know if I should

00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,240
be looking at this you can create it you

00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,380
can open in a disposable VM knowing that

00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,940
if anything happens at least he'll be

00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,790
completely confined to that VM and

00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:06,650
destroyed once you have to shut it down

00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:08,060
you can sanitize PDFs which is really

00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:10,190
awesome part if you receive anything

00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:11,570
from a vendor you have no idea what's in

00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,070
there but you really still want to be

00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:15,320
able to look at it you can send it to a

00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:18,080
disposable VM they will convert it to

00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,990
images and then create a new PDF that's

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,580
just images and all the badness will go

00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,870
away obviously there's downsides that

00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,180
you can't copy paste from that anymore

00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:27,920
but yeah but if you've if you looked at

00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,600
a PDF and you think it's safe it

00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,830
preserves the original and that you can

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,880
then go back to you and open if you want

00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:38,330
to upgrades are awesome for fedora

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,370
fedora fedora comes out and you assign a

00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:41,960
different template to your work and say

00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,340
I like it so you can go back to the

00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,050
previous one with it just click of a

00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,730
button saying to use this template VM

00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,740
instead of this template VM you can also

00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:50,960
switch your attempt your work VM

00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,640
entirely to Debian like on a on a whim

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,080
for a day if you wanted to and then go

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,240
back to the door if you really wanted to

00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:01,880
I'm not sure why you would because

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:03,500
Fedora is obviously superior so volt VMs

00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,180
you also enjoy because that's that's

00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,220
where you would store or your sensitive

00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,690
data you really don't want getting out

00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:12,110
and being exfiltrated

00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:13,370
out of your workstation and I've already

00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,830
demonstrated you have different end

00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:17,630
points a gross egress end points for

00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:20,000
each ad VM that's the system that I

00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:22,250
really love and enjoy I know that if I'm

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,660
looking at this website it will go out

00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,010
through this end point if I'm looking at

00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,450
this website it will just be the work

00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:28,490
end point and I don't have to worry

00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:31,130
about how many traces I'm leaving out

00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:34,580
there on the internet so will drive you

00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:35,490
mad copy pasting as I mentioned will

00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,590
drive it completely

00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:39,990
Bunker's even though you know that this

00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:41,730
is the right thing to do not being able

00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:43,410
to screen share will drive you crazy if

00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,670
you've ever if you're a manager and ian

00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,110
is like hey let me just screen share

00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,910
with you quickly and we'll forget that

00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:49,710
you know to be able to do that ever you

00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:51,630
can also not do it on Weiland so we kind

00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:54,450
of share this pain with all the other

00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:55,679
security tools you can screen share if

00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:57,870
you run as there's a way to run

00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,429
standalone VMs inside a complete window

00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,870
windows environment as you would

00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:02,520
normally do if you're running the

00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:04,380
virtualized VM for anything

00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,090
you can't screen share from that it will

00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,960
only show you the screen that's inside

00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:12,240
that standalone VM there's weird suspend

00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,820
resume bugs if you are using a laptop

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,230
you already know that suspend resume is

00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,750
like magic that sometimes works

00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:20,910
sometimes doesn't well you sprinkled so

00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:23,640
much more magic with Zen no words and I

00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:25,470
know they're running the VM so it's just

00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,900
you will probably not bother most of the

00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:30,270
time with this laptop it's it's really

00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,770
one or ten times that I'm able to resume

00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:36,270
most of the time something just doesn't

00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:39,030
quite come back right there is obviously

00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:40,380
a launch lag for at VMs when they're not

00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,330
running already so if you wanted to

00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,400
start a new Firefox session from the

00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:45,920
personal VM but personal VM is not

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,630
running then you have to basically

00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,790
twiddle your thumbs for about 45 to 60

00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:53,580
seconds waiting while the actual VM is

00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:55,650
started when the Firefox is read cold

00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,600
from the disk all that comes up and that

00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,550
ready to go for you once the VM is

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,050
running it kept streets kept running so

00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:03,030
obviously if you do it after that it's

00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:05,610
gonna be fast but on but there's this

00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:07,520
definite launch lag when def p.m. is not

00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:09,510
running when you're starting it

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,610
especially there's a way there's a

00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:13,230
dependency saying if I'm if I want to if

00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:15,990
I open an untrusted VM and it's set to

00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:17,940
go out via tor then it will start the

00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,470
tour gateway and know the way for that

00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,840
to connect and it will start the app

00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:25,410
gateway in the app VM so that's that's

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,240
that's a pain there's rare but random

00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:28,590
weirdness that ever that shows up every

00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,510
now and again like I said there's a lot

00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:32,970
of magic involved in modern Linux

00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:35,100
workstation and Zen just amplifies it

00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:38,309
and cubes just amplifies it to a hundred

00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:39,780
percent occasionally at the ends just

00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:42,030
won't start so you click on it and it

00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,350
just just sits there you have to shut it

00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:46,200
down and you start it again then it'll

00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:48,600
maybe work now microphone recently

00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,200
stopped working for me there is a some

00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,030
also

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,590
pulse audio magic where you can actually

00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,150
send microphone to different fbms

00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:55,560
depending on what you're doing that's

00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,030
not working for me I'm not sure why I

00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,260
haven't dug yet into it there was an

00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:01,140
impulsive day probably that's what

00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:02,910
broken the resolver can stop working in

00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,350
one of you at VM so everything obviously

00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:07,500
stops working they have to figure out

00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:09,840
what's going on backups are complicated

00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,850
you can there's a built-in way to do

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,710
backups but there is no automated

00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:16,010
hands-off backup mechanism so you have

00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:19,230
to remember to do your backups manually

00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:20,670
there that's that's that's annoying if

00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,590
you have your own backup scripts you can

00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:24,120
run them inside each at VM then you

00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:27,660
obviously have to start and run each at

00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:30,330
VM for the backups so what's the future

00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:32,790
outlook for cubes OS it is sponsored by

00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:35,220
invisible things lab it is under active

00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:37,860
development invisible things lab I

00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:40,140
believe is a Polish company they don't

00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:42,270
list their location in their website so

00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,700
I'm not sure if that's changed or not

00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:47,130
most of the developers are from Poland

00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,920
it is partially user supported via

00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:51,210
donations you can donate there is

00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,470
there's quite a few backers there but

00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:54,450
obviously does not pay all the bills

00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:56,430
it's not a self-supporting

00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:59,550
self-contained system it is still

00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:01,980
maintained by a business entity it uses

00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:04,140
em so if you've read the news and you

00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:07,770
know anything about Zen Zen is never

00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:10,020
going to be in mainline Zen was promoted

00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:11,730
and used by Amazon Amazon recently

00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,800
stated that they are moving away from

00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:17,730
Zen so I'm not sure what kind of future

00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:19,230
we'll have for Zen and cubes OS in a

00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:21,060
version for cubes OS has been rewritten

00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,830
to be able to have pluggable

00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:24,120
virtualization support so I think

00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:28,950
they're thinking the same thing they

00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:31,590
need to be able to move away from Zen if

00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:33,420
that if the time comes they continue to

00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:36,300
use then despite obviously there's been

00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:38,520
quite a few security vulnerabilities in

00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,230
the recent past they it's the system

00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,270
that provides the best hardware

00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,590
virtualization as opposed to all the

00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:46,020
other ones at least that's the claim

00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:47,910
that the state in their website it has

00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:50,910
an active and diverse user base so

00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:52,350
that's if something happens and the

00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:54,120
business entity behind behind it goes

00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:56,640
away there is a chance that the cubes

00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:00,140
office will continue functioning as as

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,140
purely community supported

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,140
so who is it for it I think it's it's

00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,570
for system administrators especially who

00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:10,630
are gatekeepers with access to

00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:12,870
privileged information it is been

00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:14,860
promoted to be used by journalists I

00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:16,720
with caveat that if they have a

00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,159
knowledgeable support department because

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,669
they will be obviously needing to do

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,900
this

00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:25,620
being able to securely open attachments

00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:28,539
without fear of them compromising your

00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:31,750
workstation is a very important point

00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:33,190
for a lot of journalists who receive the

00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:35,890
information from leakers and other

00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:38,640
sources and oftentimes that information

00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:40,659
is just spearfishing

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,950
anyone expecting direct precision

00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:44,710
attacks we will fund it in savvy

00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:47,169
adversaries draw your own conclusions

00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:48,760
there and anyone working in environments

00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:50,799
where they're likely to be in trouble if

00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,360
caught by dragnet surveillance so if

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:55,240
you're in a country country where

00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,530
there's a lot of just dragnet just

00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,390
collect everything about all your

00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:01,360
computer usage being able to go out via

00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:04,390
different endpoint VPNs and yet tour and

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:07,679
so forth can give you an important way

00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:11,830
of remaining unseen by such things

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:13,179
who is it not for anyone not very

00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,980
familiar with Linux it is not a

00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:16,480
workstation that you can give to a

00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,070
non-technical person and say here this

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,740
will make you secure because they will

00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:22,630
just not use it this is unfortunately

00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:26,890
not very usable for anybody who is not a

00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:28,659
very savvy Linux person anyone who can't

00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:30,700
afford modern powerful hardware and

00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:32,650
that's an important point here uhm CPUs

00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,440
capable of ETX and vtd are expensive

00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:39,460
they are in very new lots of RAM is

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,530
expensive still large as as the nvme

00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:43,210
discs are expensive it all comes with a

00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:44,590
high price tag you have you know if you

00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:46,030
want to use it on your laptop your

00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:48,490
laptop will probably cost upwards of

00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:50,860
$2,000 this is not something you can

00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:52,780
install and use on your old five year

00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:55,390
old system that that means not used for

00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:57,220
anything else this is a dedicated I

00:27:55,390 --> 00:28:00,100
bought this specifically to use this

00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:02,890
sort of thing anyone who's in danger of

00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:04,600
physical duress threats obviously having

00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:07,299
cubes on your workstation is a very

00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,340
quick telltale sign that you are hiding

00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:10,840
something or something is really odd

00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:13,059
about you so if you're in a situation

00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,840
where you are afraid somebody might come

00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,880
down come

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,460
and they boot this up and shake you down

00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,929
you may be this may not be the best

00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:22,029
solution for you you're probably better

00:28:19,929 --> 00:28:24,580
off using something like tails OS which

00:28:22,029 --> 00:28:28,690
is a bootable from USB hides all your

00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:30,490
traces and so what can you use instead

00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:32,140
there's you can also use instead some of

00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:33,880
the things you can reach some degree of

00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:35,230
feature parity with keep service by

00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,000
using something like a fire jail

00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:39,490
sandboxing mechanism for your firefox

00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,770
sessions you can use flat back or other

00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:44,200
sandboxing for further out other

00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:45,820
applications you can use UNIX for

00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,130
persistent anonymous surfing if you need

00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:51,700
to do this often times you can use tails

00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:53,500
OS for disposable web sessions and but I

00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:56,110
will note that cubes OS offers all of

00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,940
the above but with a convenient ways of

00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:00,340
doing doing your work or copying files

00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:02,649
doing disposable things at a click of a

00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:10,470
button when it works it works 99% of the

00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:13,519
time any questions yeah

00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:13,519
[Music]

00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:31,629
so the question is would you is there

00:29:30,249 --> 00:29:33,419
any other mechanism under the control C

00:29:31,629 --> 00:29:36,700
control V to send to the clipboard and

00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:38,200
you can use a mechanism like highlight

00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,479
and it will send in an middle button

00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,669
paste but inside the same VM you will

00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:44,019
have to still control shift C to get it

00:29:42,669 --> 00:29:48,239
to the global clipboard and control

00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:48,239
shift V to get into any other that the M

00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:59,200
yeah those keystrokes are global to dumb

00:29:56,169 --> 00:30:00,459
zero so they will still work even even

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,200
if your terminal doesn't support control

00:30:00,459 --> 00:30:04,749
shift C once you get into the clipboard

00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:08,079
into the X clipboard control ship C will

00:30:04,749 --> 00:30:10,239
get that into the global into your

00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:12,039
global clipboard and the ctrl shift V

00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:13,599
will send it to the at the M and once

00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:15,909
you're in that one still once that

00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:17,440
clipboard isn't in that VM you can use

00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:19,919
whatever mechanism that you usually use

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,919
to paste

00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:36,320
now control-shift see is caught by the

00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:38,330
graphical interface it is not that

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,900
keystroke does not make it into your ad

00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:44,420
VM does that make sense right

00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:49,930
I do have still a but five minute thing

00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:49,930
about copperhead OS so about cubes yeah

00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:05,820
so you mentioned that journalists using

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,010
this would have to have a strong IT

00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:10,290
support department the thing I worry the

00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:11,490
most about using cubes out of the box is

00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:13,440
something like the Fedora browser

00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:16,650
hitting an exploit kit or spearfishing

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:20,040
hitting dropping like VMware malware or

00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:22,620
do you ever worry about your your RW

00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:25,830
config being complic being caught by

00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:28,440
this or or something like shimming the

00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:31,290
qvm start like anything qvm - Star

00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,030
Command I also I always worry about such

00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,140
things but you know what what can I you

00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:37,830
know the level of what can I do about

00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:40,290
this on a day to day basis is is limited

00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:41,970
right we can talk about it later because

00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:43,380
it's a fairly in-depth discussion there

00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:46,950
it's not something I can talk from the

00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:48,390
podium I mean move on to keep copperhead

00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:50,460
and then we'll go through discussion so

00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:53,790
Copperhead OS how those of you who don't

00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:56,010
know it's an harden Android distribution

00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:59,130
or was or is hardened Android

00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:01,350
distribution the the reason I started

00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:03,420
using it because actually I've been

00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:06,780
using Android for quite a bit but it's

00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:09,240
been a long time I have I have an office

00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:11,130
in the village where I work and there is

00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,500
a psychiatrist's office right next to it

00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:15,690
and there was a pop up on my very

00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,370
friendly Google say hey can you share

00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:19,170
your experience about using psychiatrist

00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:21,090
services so that other people know what

00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,470
to expect how visa never went to

00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:24,510
psychiatrist services but now Google

00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:25,620
thinks I did so I'm kind of worried

00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:28,530
about what kind of information I'm

00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:31,260
leaking that Google will make available

00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:32,910
to anybody else so my decision to go

00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,050
with Copperhead was partly different by

00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:36,210
this I got pissed off by that

00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:39,120
notification because I my office is

00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:42,270
literally next door to them I decided to

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,490
try the pure iOS be if you looked at

00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:47,010
what's the best what was the most secure

00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:48,480
Android and all the hacker types will

00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:51,060
tell you the Copperhead OS was it so I

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,580
did it but so much this happen happened

00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:56,670
since May Copperhead OS and its previous

00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:59,220
incarnation imploded and died and they

00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:01,980
there was a internal political spat

00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:06,300
between the two founding members of

00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:08,910
Copperhead OS the company has suffered

00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,740
greatly from it the developer before he

00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:13,070
left

00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:16,490
destroyed the signing keys

00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:18,470
so anything that any available devices

00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:21,230
out there in the world using Copperhead

00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:23,299
OS have been basically bricked they are

00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:24,639
still workable they're still usable but

00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:27,259
the Albus they cannot receive any

00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:28,490
notifications and any updates anything

00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:30,649
like that they have to be completely

00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:34,669
reimaged other than able to receive

00:33:30,649 --> 00:33:37,700
security updates from that point on yeah

00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:40,610
so what are the guiding principles

00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:41,840
behind copperhead it is there are a lot

00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:44,110
of this we're going to be the same as

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,789
with other pure AOSP like lineage OS

00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:47,330
devices so it's a Google free Android

00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:50,779
experience

00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:53,029
it's they provide fast a security

00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:56,029
patching turnaround I believe the main

00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:57,679
developer of of copperhead OS gave a

00:33:56,029 --> 00:34:00,049
presentation last year I believe that

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:02,139
the Linux security summit about the

00:34:00,049 --> 00:34:04,940
hardened Android stuff or maybe not um

00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:07,009
two years right

00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:11,750
they provide hardened kernel obviously

00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:13,639
with KSP P patches they believe that he

00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:16,190
worked very closely with case and the

00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:18,250
case BP project to to provide those in

00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:21,200
as part of the copperhead OS kernel

00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:23,750
provides Cardon compiler tool chain and

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,810
the stricter selinux policies that cool

00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:30,050
things like mac address randomization so

00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:31,940
on every boot your Mac your wireless Mac

00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:33,260
that would be different so that you know

00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,569
if somebody was trying to track you by

00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:38,119
your MAC address they will not be able

00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:39,530
to do so as as we know that malls like

00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:41,389
to do this when you enter this door so

00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:44,179
they know if you're a return customer or

00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:45,859
not there's stricter defaults stricter

00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:47,869
defaults for a lot of things all of the

00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:50,060
radios except for the actual LTE were

00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:50,690
disabled so you couldn't use bluetooth

00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,490
out of the box

00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:53,810
good news Wireless out of the box none

00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,129
of that stuff there's analyzed a lot

00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:58,010
more if you're even the website they'll

00:34:55,129 --> 00:34:59,800
give you more detail about this so I was

00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:02,599
very sad obviously when it went away

00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:04,040
yeah I I use gifts too many times so

00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:06,109
maybe I should be more like Alex so I

00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:08,930
should like this is a picture by elliott

00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:13,490
and ivan the terrible' kills his only

00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:15,319
son it is it was the end of the Rurik

00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:17,569
dynasty and there was in introduced

00:35:15,319 --> 00:35:19,460
hundred years of what called the times

00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:22,040
of trouble i shouldn't take make that

00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:26,430
light jokes about that

00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:28,280
so uh device requirements it is only

00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:30,930
available on a very small set of devices

00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:33,630
he was in Google Nexus not supported

00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:35,370
anymore because they dropped that Google

00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:36,900
pixel that's what what I got I had I

00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:39,150
purchased the Google pixel directly from

00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:42,360
them yeah as a Google pixel to is also

00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:43,770
usable and there's development boards if

00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,360
you just wanted to test it out how it

00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:49,650
works in they supported high key dev

00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:51,510
boards installation its downloadable and

00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:53,490
installable it you can download an image

00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:55,440
and install it but you will not receive

00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:56,880
over-the-air updates so every time there

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,340
is an update to copperhead you have to

00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,730
do it manually and reinstall it on your

00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:04,140
on your device obviously your unless you

00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:07,380
are completely crazy you're not going to

00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:09,960
do this you can buy a pixel from

00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:12,240
Copperhead os the markup is crazy it's

00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,460
80% markup so you will if you think if a

00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,620
pixel 2 goes for about 600 it's a kind

00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:18,990
of $50.00 you can expect to pay about

00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:21,780
$1,200 for it if you buy directly from

00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:24,210
from Copperhead you can send in your own

00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:26,340
device you will still be paying a lot of

00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:27,960
money to get it no basically you're

00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:30,330
paying not just for the OS you paying

00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:34,440
for the over-the-air updates until they

00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:36,270
stop obviously so daily use what's the

00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,740
daily use like for Copperhead OS and and

00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:41,250
for the most part it just like any other

00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:43,380
pure a LSP device like lineage OS some

00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:46,350
apps are available from FF droid f droid

00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:48,570
is a great application it's an app store

00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:50,610
there is k-9 mail which feels like

00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:52,980
you're using a mail client from 2001

00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:56,490
there are some messengers available its

00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:59,640
telegram riot silence available from

00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:01,380
from f-droid some other apps you can

00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,730
also install from the Play Store and

00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:06,270
there is multiples way of doing it

00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:09,540
there's Yelp which is a way to install

00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:12,600
to get apks directly from the Play Store

00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:14,430
I believe it by my violate various

00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,420
agreements with Google so use at your

00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:18,120
own discretion

00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:21,600
there's a PK mirror which is also a way

00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:23,220
to then get the apks direct not directly

00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,620
but from a mirror of the Play Store

00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:27,390
there is Amazon apps Amazon App Store

00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:30,900
that you can install with limited

00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:33,330
success because Amazon they're like

00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,960
f-droid but proprietary there's their

00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:38,020
little very few apps

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,880
or any good so many apps may not work

00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:42,880
right when seen stolen obviously because

00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:45,640
there is no Google Foundation GSF Google

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,320
whatever you call it micro G did not

00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,730
work on copperhead OS that was a

00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,350
designed designed issue decision by

00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:51,910
Copperhead they didn't want to support

00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:54,970
it micro G if you don't know what that

00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:56,710
is there's a way as a cleanroom bri

00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:58,930
implementation of a lot of google stuff

00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:00,700
without actually being from google but

00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:03,520
you still basically have to interact

00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:05,770
with their proprietary services so

00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,510
copperhead is an excellent is excellent

00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:09,490
for secure communication and browsing i

00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:13,450
also has excellent remote at the station

00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:15,970
feature there is a way to verify that

00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:19,270
your android device is actually running

00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:22,410
the proper image so for example if

00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:24,580
you're coming in in a conspirator

00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:27,460
meeting and everybody needs to confirm

00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:29,980
that their their android devices are

00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:31,540
still running the proper thing there's

00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:34,270
an auditor application that you can run

00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:37,110
and you can scan a QR code and it will

00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:39,100
tell that uses the secret that is in the

00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:42,070
trusted execution environment on your

00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:44,070
android that will challenge they'll be

00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:46,540
response unless there is the proper

00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:48,400
image installed they will not be able to

00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:49,780
give you the proper response with a

00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,730
challenge so this is a pretty cool

00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:53,800
application it is now it is still now

00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:56,380
available as a separate app it was only

00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,910
usable on pixel to on midi and some

00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,230
other devices i believe in the haddon

00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:02,950
pixel one i've never used it because I

00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:05,920
only have a pixel one so what were you

00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:07,420
love about pure ASP no battery life is

00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:12,870
amazing on pure AOSP

00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:15,880
yeah I've never had to charge my device

00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:17,170
twice a day before I started while I was

00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,330
using Copperhead OS and the same

00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:21,790
experience with lineage OS so Play

00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:25,630
services are extremely battery hungry I

00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:26,770
would have a fully charged device in the

00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,330
morning I will come back home I still

00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:31,710
have 45 percent battery left and this is

00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:33,880
despite using the phone all the time

00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:36,000
well there's also knowledge that you're

00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,590
obviously not being tracked as much

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,820
right because I mean the telcos are

00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,990
obviously still tracking it because you

00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:43,750
still have to communicate with the

00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:45,040
towers the telcos they know where you

00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:47,430
are they know what you're doing there's

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,349
you know still being tracked through the

00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:51,839
browsers all that stuff so there is

00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:53,089
caveat emptor there so your mobile

00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:55,410
service provider still checks you

00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:57,720
there's fast security patches that come

00:39:55,410 --> 00:40:00,089
to your pure ASP device main lineage OS

00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,349
is great at this Copperhead OS is also

00:40:00,089 --> 00:40:03,510
very great at it they patch the

00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:06,859
Bluetooth vulnerability within literally

00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:08,880
six hours of it becoming available

00:40:06,859 --> 00:40:10,349
there's knowledge that you're using free

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,290
software so f-droid supports

00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:14,970
reproducible build so that's cool stuff

00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:17,700
some features may be source available

00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:19,829
not fewer open source so that's

00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,780
important caveat there Copperhead OS was

00:40:19,829 --> 00:40:25,290
a source is a source available system

00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:28,440
there it's not a free license so what

00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:30,510
you'll hate most of the apps that you're

00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,819
trying to use from a peek a mirror or

00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:37,200
from Yelp but will give you this all the

00:40:32,819 --> 00:40:39,000
time they still may work so that even

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:44,069
despite giving you this tip but they

00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,900
this pop-up but you will experience a

00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:47,910
huge loss of convenient perks you know

00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,069
mobile devices and mobile devices not

00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:52,049
just something we use for emailing and

00:40:50,069 --> 00:40:54,480
messaging right we use it to play games

00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:56,640
we use it to play we'll use it to find

00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,960
parking spots we use it to find was a

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,049
good place to eat you know

00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,760
hail a ride and all other things you

00:41:01,049 --> 00:41:06,420
know you were pretty much going back to

00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:09,599
what mobile phones were in 2005 if

00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:11,309
you're using PR SP device sideload apps

00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,829
may or may not work they will probably

00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:15,270
not deliver notifications so

00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:17,819
notification is something that is Google

00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:20,670
messaging sir called messaging GCM their

00:41:17,819 --> 00:41:24,030
uses I'll be sleeping a pure ASP device

00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:25,619
you will not get notifications app you

00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:27,349
know app authors do not care about your

00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:30,480
weird setup they will just blow you away

00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:32,250
you can communicate securely only with

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,900
the same three people you know who are

00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:36,299
using the same things as you are so

00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:38,430
that's if you are if you have a spy

00:41:36,299 --> 00:41:40,589
circle that's great for you if you have

00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:43,410
real people who are using things like

00:41:40,589 --> 00:41:44,910
slack or Facebook Messenger or something

00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:46,079
like that and obviously you can't

00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:48,390
communicate with them without installing

00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,460
those things slack works but

00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:51,809
notifications don't facebook Messenger

00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,010
works actually great but then what's the

00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:54,240
point of using the device if you're

00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:57,540
going to install a facebook messenger on

00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,950
it so owning a pure ASP device comes

00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:01,110
with all the social perks of being a

00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:03,750
gluten intolerant vegan with a peanut

00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:06,360
some things you can't use some things

00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:08,040
you won't use because you know that's

00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:10,940
against your ideological reasons for

00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:13,080
getting the device in the first place

00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:15,150
yeah that was my experience I've been a

00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:16,730
vegan for about a year and I've the year

00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:20,070
with copperhead OS felt very similar

00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:22,440
also you can't play pokemon go this was

00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:24,450
an important part for me I need three

00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:27,890
more friends to complete my field

00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:27,890
research so please add me as a friend

00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:36,570
so future outlook for Copperhead they

00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:38,460
are not dead so the the Copperhead OS in

00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:40,280
the name continues the main developer

00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:43,320
who was doing all the security work is

00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:44,910
obviously out of the company but I'm not

00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,950
going to go into detail or take sides

00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:48,660
here I'm just saying that Copperhead is

00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:50,790
not dead they are releasing an image

00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:54,600
that you can install and it can dig

00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:57,780
their stories back you can buy pixels if

00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:59,910
you wanted right Copperhead OS who is it

00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:01,530
for anyone really worried about dragnet

00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:03,720
private data collection by government or

00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:06,210
large corporations by large corporations

00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:11,730
obviously me and Google government I

00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:13,350
also mean yeah Google this is going to

00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:16,230
be true for most pure ASP it's not just

00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:17,760
true for Copperhead OS anyone expecting

00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:19,470
direct precision attacks we will find it

00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,200
and savvy adversaries there's a lot of

00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:23,610
protections that Copperhead kernel

00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,740
hardening and just general compiler

00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:28,170
stack hardening will give you there is a

00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:30,510
lot of patches to the PDF view or no

00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:32,910
other things so if you are expecting

00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:34,410
spearfishing on a daily basis that's

00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:36,630
device is probably something that you

00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:38,220
would enjoy it singles for journalists

00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:39,240
against and goes for activists again

00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,920
it's kind of funny that government

00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:43,970
employees and activists can use this to

00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:46,560
protect from each other

00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:48,150
who is it not for so anyone who needs to

00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,220
use the device for more than secure

00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:51,810
communication like I said you if you're

00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:55,770
getting a PR ASP device you're going

00:43:51,810 --> 00:44:00,720
back 12 years to when the first iPhone

00:43:55,770 --> 00:44:02,610
iPhone just came out what am i using now

00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,070
I'm back to stock Google pie

00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:07,620
very very image my device obviously the

00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:09,000
moment when it was said that the the

00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:10,740
company was in trouble because the last

00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,890
thing I wanted is have some sort of a

00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:15,690
situation where

00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:18,180
you know employee with bad faith is

00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:20,849
going to do stuff so I reinvented the

00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:22,740
same day for stock Google pie I have

00:44:20,849 --> 00:44:24,900
some privacy tweaks I try to limit which

00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:26,430
apps I use there is a hermit app which

00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,140
is makes a light you know there's a lot

00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:30,329
of there you can use a lot of

00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:32,160
applications through their mobile mobile

00:44:30,329 --> 00:44:33,569
light applications and the hermit is an

00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,280
application that makes that easier so

00:44:33,569 --> 00:44:37,410
check it out hermit app Google for it

00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,980
you will find it I don't intend to

00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:42,420
switch to lineage OS primarily because

00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:45,240
not getting notification was impacting

00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:47,760
my work way too much I the rest of my

00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:50,940
team uses slack for good for bad there

00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,230
is things like IRC cloud that I want to

00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:54,690
be able to receive notifications from

00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:58,619
not being able to do that is a big big

00:44:54,690 --> 00:45:00,420
downside to do this I might go back to

00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:04,490
copperhead OS depending on how company

00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:08,970
fares will see does that make me a sheep

00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:10,770
maybe for now that's a very but at least

00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:15,319
I have an option to evolve to a next

00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:15,319
level which is fluffy thank you

00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:19,919
