	The Future of Security is in Open Silicon - Joel Wittenauer, Rambus Security, Cryptography Research

In this talk we describe how we used an open operating system (Zephyr) to create a root of trust running on RISC-V based security CPU to secure a high-level operating system (Linux). Security features of the RISC-V processor and the assisting hardware security cores are utilized to implement three internal privilege levels within the root of trust in order to create a freely-programmable application sandbox providing services for Linux.

The talk quickly describes the way Zephyr OS is used as the base, internal architecture of the root of trust, the functionality of its three internal privilege levels and the hardware security cores, the programming interfaces and the current integration state with the Linux host. We would also like to establish a dialogue with the Linux security community in order to understand how to better serve Linux security.
