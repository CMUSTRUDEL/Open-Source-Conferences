Description: 
	Getting Started with the TPM2 Software Stack (TSS2) - Philip Tricca, Intel

For the last ~2 years Intel and our collaborators in Trusted Computing Group (TCG) and OSS community have been working to standardize and implement APIs and infrastructure to drive interactions with TPM2 devices. This work has produced TCG standards describing the APIs, an OSS implementation of the APIs and a small community that has organized around the implementation on the web / Github at https://github.com/tpm2-software. In this talk Phil will give an overview of the project before breaking down the various components and APIs in detail. He'll discuss major accomplishments in the year since our last update at the Linux Pliumbers Conference as well as future project direction and use cases.
