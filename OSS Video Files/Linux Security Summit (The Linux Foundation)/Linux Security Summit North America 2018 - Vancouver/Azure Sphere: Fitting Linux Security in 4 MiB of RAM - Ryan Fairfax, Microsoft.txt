	Azure Sphere: Fitting Linux Security in 4 MiB of RAM - Ryan Fairfax, Microsoft

Azure Sphere is a new solution for building highly secured, connected microcontroller-powered devices. It includes a customized version of the Linux kernel and work to fit the OS within a highly constrained memory footprint. In this talk we will cover the security components of the system, including a custom Linux Security Module, modifications and extensions to existing kernel components, and user space components that form the security backbone of the OS. Along the way weâ€™ll discuss false starts, failed attempts, and the challenges of taking modern security techniques and fitting them in resource constrained devices.
