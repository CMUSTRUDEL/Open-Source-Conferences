	Using the TPM NVRAM to Protect Secure Boot Keys in POWER9 OpenPOWER Systems - Claudio Siqueira de Carvalho, IBM

In OpenPOWER systems, most firmware code used to boot the platform OS is stored in the processor flash memory (PNOR). Although PNOR is non-volatile memory, it is unprotected. In order to secure boot the platform OS, it is well known that only platform OSs signed with authorized keys should booted. However, saving the authorized keys in a secure non-volatile memory is as important as using them to verify the platform OS. In this presentation, Claudio Carvalho will show how the shielded non-volatile memory (NVRAM) of the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) has become essential in OpenPOWER systems to protect the secure boot keys stored in PNOR. This discussion includes design and implementation aspects that are both currently in progress for the OpenPOWER firmware and the Linux Kernel layers.
