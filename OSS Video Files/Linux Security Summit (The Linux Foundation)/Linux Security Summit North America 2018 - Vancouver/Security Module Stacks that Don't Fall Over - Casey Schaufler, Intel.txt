	Security Module Stacks that Don't Fall Over - Casey Schaufler, Intel

Security module stacking will provide a new level of flexibility in configuring system security. But there's a real risk that combining security models will result in a system that may be secure, but isn't useful. This may also be true when the same security module is used with multiple policy definitions. Casey Schaufler, the module stacking developer, will discuss the pitfalls of security module stacking and how they can be avoided. He will be talking about the configuration of existing modules and where they have known conflicts. There will also be discussion about how new modules should use the infrastructure in a way that reduces the potential for conflicts. A special emphasis will be placed on networking, where dragons of various colors lurk behind every acronym.
