	Syzbot and the Tale of Thousand Kernel Bugs - Dmitry Vyukov, Google

The root cause of most software exploits is bugs. Hardening, mitigations and containers are important, but they can't protect a system with thousands of bugs. In this presentation, Dmitry Vyukov will review the current [sad] situation with Linux kernel bugs and security implications based on their experience testing kernel for the past 3 years; overview a set of bug finding tools they are developing (syzbot, syzkaller, KASAN, KMSAN, KTSAN); and discuss problems and areas that require community help to improve the situation.

About Dmitry Vyukov
I am working on Linux kernel dynamic bug detection tools (KASAN, KMSAN, KTSAN), kernel fuzzing (syzkaller, syzbot) for Linux and other OSes (Fuchsia, gVisor). Before that developed ThreadSanitizer, a user-space race detector (part of llvm, gcc, Go), go-fuzz (fuzzer for Go).
