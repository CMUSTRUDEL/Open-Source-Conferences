thanks for coming everyone I will get

00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,930
started I'm James Morris I'll just make

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,620
a couple of comments I guess at the

00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:14,309
beginning of this the eighth Linux

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,410
Security Summit it's now this event now

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:19,439
Linux security summit North America is

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:24,119
another event in Europe is starting this

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,350
year later in this year and it's it's

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,960
incredible to see how many people are

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,570
now attending we had to get a room

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,160
upgrade for this we ran out of

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,800
registrations and I think some people

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,630
may have initially been wait-listed and

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,079
then were able to register after we were

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,760
upgraded so thanks to the Linux

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,850
Foundation organizers and the sponsors

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,610
for making this happen from a logistical

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,980
point of view and obviously everyone for

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:54,809
participating and bringing all your

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,579
ideas and enthusiasm so apologies for

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,710
the early start we also had a record

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,219
number of really good or great

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,019
submissions and so we decided to just

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,659
start a little earlier and it end a

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,729
little later on the first day and we

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,310
also try and make sure there are long

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,900
breaks particularly at lunchtime for the

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,159
for the hallway tracks and the lunchtime

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:22,049
tracks this is really about

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:24,890
collaboration here ok I will hand this

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,570
