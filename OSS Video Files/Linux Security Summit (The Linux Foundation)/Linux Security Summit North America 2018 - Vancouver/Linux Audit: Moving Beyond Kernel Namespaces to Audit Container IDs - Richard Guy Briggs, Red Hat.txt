	Linux Audit: Moving Beyond Kernel Namespaces to Audit Container IDs - Richard Guy Briggs, Red Hat

Audit will need to run in containers, possibly for distributions, but more likely for docker micro-services to meet new certification requirements. Since the kernel has no concept of containers,
identifying the container involved in audit messages will equip tracking tools to follow process events in containers. 

Namespaces were the primary focus of my container audit presentation two years ago in Toronto. Feedback and further work made it clear that no one namespace or subset could be depended on to be part of a container, so another approach was needed to track container activity.

Several design proposals and several patchsets have been posted aimed at providing a method of tracking container activity by audit. Allowing multiple audit daemons, each with its own rule space and queue along with a system-wide audit message routing configuration is the current plan.
