The Linux crypto subsystem has a poor reputation when it comes to usability of its API. This is not entirely undeserved, but it makes sense to take a closer look at why the current API was designed the way it is and what we are doing to improve it. Also, we'll take a look at some examples of how a better understanding of the underlying crypto on the part of the crypto API user would have resulted in much better (and more secure) code.
