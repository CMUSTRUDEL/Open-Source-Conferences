Tracing has the opposite purpose of security. Security tries to hide secrets, and the less the Linux kernel allows user applications know, the better the security. Tracing on the other hand, tries to give as much information as it can to the user. It should only give this information to those that needs it, but even determining that conflicts many times with the security ideas. This talk will talk a bit about what tracing is trying to show, and to whom it is showing it to. It will discuss tactics that are done that Linux kernel security folks should really be aware of. As tracing tries to be as low overhead when not enabled, it will take on tricks like live text modification, and redirecting calls. Tracing does everything a root kit author loves. And this talk will tell you what you need to know about that.
