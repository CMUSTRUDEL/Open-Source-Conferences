Speakers: Luke Hinds
Keylime (keylime.dev) is a young, rapidly growing open source project originally created in the security research department of MIT's Lincoln Laboratory. It provides a way of measuring the cryptographic hardware root of trust of machines hosting an Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip. Keylime is about making TPM technology accessible for developers and users. It handles the complexity, you drive the use case!
