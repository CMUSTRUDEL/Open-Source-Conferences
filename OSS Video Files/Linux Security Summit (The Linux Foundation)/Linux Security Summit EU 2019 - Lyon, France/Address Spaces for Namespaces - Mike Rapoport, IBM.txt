Address space isolation is used to protect the kernel and userspace programs from each other for ages.

Assuming that kernel exploits and speculation vulnerabilities are inevitable it's worth to isolate parts of the kernel to minimize damage that these exploits can cause.

One way to create such isolation is to assign an address space to the Linux namespaces, so that tasks running in namespace A have different view of kernel memory mappings than the tasks running in namespace B.

We propose to extend the SL*B allocators with the ability to create "exclusive" caches visible only in one namespace and thus ensure that per-namespace objects are mapped only in the owning namespace address
space.

We'll present the design of the "exclusive" caches and POC implementation targeting network namespaces.
