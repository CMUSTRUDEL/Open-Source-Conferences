	Deep Analysis of Exploitable Linux Kernel Vulnerabilities 2017-2019 - Tong Lin & Luhai Chen, Intel

To improve security, a series of hardening features (such as SMEP/PXN, SMAP/PAN, KASLR, CFI, etc.) were added to Linux kernel. Indeed, these mitigations have reduced the impact of vulnerabilities and made some exploits invalid. However, at the same time, some exploitation techniques which could bypass these existing mitigations are constantly being disclosed.

This talk will first detail the basic Linux kernel privilege escalation techniques, highlighting how these techniques work and how adversaries are using them. Then, some typical exploitable Linux kernel vulnerabilities from 2017 to 2019 will be selected for in-depth analysis. Specifically, the complete exploit chain which includes getting kernel arbitrary R/W and bypassing mitigations will be shown for each case.
