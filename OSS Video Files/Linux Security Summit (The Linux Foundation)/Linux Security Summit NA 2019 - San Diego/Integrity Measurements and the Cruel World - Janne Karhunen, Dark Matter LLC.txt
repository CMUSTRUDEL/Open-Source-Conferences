	Integrity Measurements and the Cruel World - Janne Karhunen, Dark Matter LLC

Offline attacks have been a hot topic for a while now, yet the deployments of integrity measurement systems have been scarce especially in the embedded world. Many deployment efforts haveyielded failures for multiple reasons, usually getting stuck with performance and measurement reliability issues due to system power outages and crashes.We have managed to overcome most of these issues for security-enhanced android device and the Linux integrity subsystem appears to work like clockwork without causing unnecessary pains for the end user. In this talk, we cover the changes needed to make things (mostly) work and how things can be improved from here.
