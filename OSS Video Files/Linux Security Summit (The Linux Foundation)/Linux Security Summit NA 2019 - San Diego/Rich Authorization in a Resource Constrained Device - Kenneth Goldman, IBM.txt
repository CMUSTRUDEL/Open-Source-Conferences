	Rich Authorization in a Resource Constrained Device - Kenneth Goldman, IBM

TPM 2.0 is an example of a low cost, resource-constrained device that provides a rich set of authorizations. The design targeted a device with very little RAM. This talk starts with the overall design of TPMauthorization policies, how they are calculated and how they are satisfied.Next, many of the policy statements are presented, with examples of use cases that they enable. Finally, a more complicated use case is presented, one that was never envisioned when the TPM was first designed.
