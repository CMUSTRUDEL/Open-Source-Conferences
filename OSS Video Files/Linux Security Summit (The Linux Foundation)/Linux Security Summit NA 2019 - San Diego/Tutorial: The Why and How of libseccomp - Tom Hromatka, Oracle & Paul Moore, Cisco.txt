	Tutorial: The Why and How of libseccomp - Tom Hromatka, Oracle & Paul Moore, Cisco

The Linux Kernel's seccomp feature can restrict the syscalls available to agiven process, thus reducing the attack surface available to untrusted andpotentially malicious programs. It is a critical building block forcontainers and process isolation in general. However, writing a seccompfilter by hand is error prone and difficult to maintain.In this tutorial session, Paul Moore and Tom Hromatka (the libseccompmaintainers) will explain how libseccomp makes this process much easier andwill guide you through making your own seccomp filter using libseccomp.
