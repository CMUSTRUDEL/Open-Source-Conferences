	Kernel Self-Protection Project - Kees Cook, Google 

This presentation will cover the year-in-review of the Kernel Self-Protection Project since the last Linux Security Summit NA. The project continues to eliminate classes of bugs and block exploitation techniques in the kernel. It will including an overview of all the security defenses landed in kernels 4.19 through 5.3. Some highlights are stack and heap auto-initialization, heap mapping robustness, per-task stack canaries, VLA removal, implicit-fallthrough removal, and the progress on upstreaming CFI.We'll also take a quick look at the evolution of kernel CVE lifetimes, find out what defenses are still under development, and note some areas where help is still needed.
