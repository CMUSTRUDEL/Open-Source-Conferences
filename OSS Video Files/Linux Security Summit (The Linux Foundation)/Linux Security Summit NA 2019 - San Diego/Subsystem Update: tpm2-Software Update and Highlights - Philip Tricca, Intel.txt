	Subsystem Update: tpm2-Software Update and Highlights - Philip Tricca, Intel 

Since our last update at LSS 2018 the tpm2-software community has been hard at work. Our implementation of components and APIs from the TCG TPM2 software stack (TSS2) architecture continue to mature and stabilize thanks to the numerous contributions from the core team and many motivated contributors. With the number of distros and projects actively using the TSS2 growing we've been hard at work solving common usability issues and expanding the tools available to bootstrap projects. This talk will focus on the significant accomplishments and new developments from the tpm2-software community in 2019 while highlighting progress on our efforts to enable use-cases important to downstream consumers.
