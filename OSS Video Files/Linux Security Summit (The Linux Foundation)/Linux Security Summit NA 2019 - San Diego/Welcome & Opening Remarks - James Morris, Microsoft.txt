I welcome everyone I will get started

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:13,920
I'm James Morris I'm the lead organizer

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:17,130
of the program committee and this is now

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,189
the ninth Linux security summit in North

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,199
America and it's been growing I just

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,900
checked weird the Linux Foundation folk

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,080
there are 250 people registered for this

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,820
and we were full we've had people for

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,130
several days trying to get in on

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,820
waitlist so it's certainly growing since

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,739
the humble beginnings back in Boston so

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,559
now as everyone would know we're on we

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,360
have three days we've graduated from a

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,809
two day conference and that allows us to

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,340
have a more relaxed schedule I think

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,410
last year we were starting early

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,110
finishing late and having rushing

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,629
between talks so now we have a like a

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,570
five minute gap in between talks for

00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:00,320
people to move and we have you know good

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,120
breaks and reasonable starting times

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,659
also we have the addition of tutorials

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,189
and while the tutorials are happening in

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,680
this room we have an unconference

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:13,229
session on the first two days and that

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,659
is actually directly downstairs under

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,490
where we are now out in there's like

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,290
four tables out there so with the

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,150
unconference session you just turn up

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,400
and decide what you want to work on or

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,820
talk about with other people so it's for

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,820
collaboration if you're not attending a

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,740
tutorial we also have both sessions and

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,180
we'll be getting like a flipchart or

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,759
something like that we can people can

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,970
write what they want so no Roberto says

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,400
who had a topic he wanted to discuss for

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:46,200
example so we can write that up on the

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:48,450
on the boss sessions I won't take up any

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,939
more valuable time at the moment I'll

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,960
just hand over to our first refereed

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,380
presentation

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,820
David Kaplan and Nathaniel McCollum will

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:03,110
be talking about Enochs a project for

00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,110
