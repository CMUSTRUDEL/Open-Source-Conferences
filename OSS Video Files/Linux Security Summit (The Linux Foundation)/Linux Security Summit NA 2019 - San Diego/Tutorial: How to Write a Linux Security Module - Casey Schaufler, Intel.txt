	Tutorial: How to Write a Linux Security Module - Casey Schaufler, Intel

You have a great idea for security in the Linux kernel, but you don't know how to add it properly. How can you implement additional security mechanism in a way that can be accepted upstream? This tutorial will teach you the basics of the Linux Security Module (LSM) infrastructure and how to use it properly. You will learn what an LSM can and cannot do, when you should use an LSM, when you should look into mainline changes and when you should look at namespaces. Security module data management conventions will be discussed. The filesystem, process, networking and audit interfaces will be covered.Casey Schaufler will be joined by Paul Moore and John Johansen to ensure that each LSM interface is covered by its expert. There's a lot of information to cover in 90 minutes, but there is no better set of instructors around.
