	Overview and Recent Developments: Linux Integrity - Mimi Zohar, IBMÂ 

The goals of the linux-integrity subsystem are to detect if files have
been accidentally or maliciously altered, both remotely and locally,
appraise a file's measurement against a "good" value stored as an
extended attribute, and enforce local file integrity.

This talk will describe the different aspects of the linux-integrity
subsystem, the security guarantees, as well as the current and future
development.
