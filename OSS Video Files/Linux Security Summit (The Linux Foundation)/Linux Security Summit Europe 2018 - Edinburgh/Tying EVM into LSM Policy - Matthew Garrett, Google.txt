Description: 
	Tying EVM into LSM Policy - Matthew Garrett, GoogleÂ 

EVM (Extended Verification Module) is a Linux kernel feature that allows the shipping of signatures covering the metadata of files, including their IMA hash. This makes it possible to verify that a file's metadata is intact, in turn ensuring that the file itself is unmodified.

This presentation will discuss how EVM can be tied into other Linux security mechanisms, making it possible to grant different privileges to applications depending on their metadata and whether or not they have valid signatures.
