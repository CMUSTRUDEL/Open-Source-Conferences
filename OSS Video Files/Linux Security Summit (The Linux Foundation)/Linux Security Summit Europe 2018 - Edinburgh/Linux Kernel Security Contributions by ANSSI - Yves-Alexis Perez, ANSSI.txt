	Linux Kernel Security Contributions by ANSSI - Yves-Alexis Perez, ANSSI 

 ANSSI, a French government agency tasked with securing systems and networks across the public administration, is a long time user and contributor of the Linux ecosystem. It has recently started contributing directly to the Linux kernel, and intends to contribute more in the near future.

This presentation will focus on the benefits of contributing back and investing time for Linux kernel security development, for the agency as well as for other downstream users like public administration and enterprises. It’ll use multiple examples, ranging from the Landlock LSM to the internally developed CLIP Linux distribution, whose patches against the Linux kernel will be submitted upstream in the upcoming months.
