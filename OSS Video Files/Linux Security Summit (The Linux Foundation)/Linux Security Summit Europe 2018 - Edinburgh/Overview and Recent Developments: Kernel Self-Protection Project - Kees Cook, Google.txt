	Overview and Recent Developments: Kernel Self-Protection Project - Kees Cook, GoogleÂ 

This presentation will cover the year-in-review of the Kernel Self-Protection Project since the last Linux Security Summit NA 2017, including an overview of all the security defenses landed in kernels 4.14 through 4.18. Some highlights are vmapped stacks, structure randomization, SLUB freelist obfuscation, set_fs() checking, fast refcount_t protection, Page Table Isolation, usercopy whitelisting, VLA removals, and the stackleak plugin.

We'll also take a quick look at the evolution of kernel CVE lifetimes, find out what defenses are still under development, and note some areas where help is still needed.
