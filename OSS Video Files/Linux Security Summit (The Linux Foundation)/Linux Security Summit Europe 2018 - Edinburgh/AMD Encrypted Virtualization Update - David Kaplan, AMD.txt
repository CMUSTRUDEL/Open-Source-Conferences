Description: 
	AMD Encrypted Virtualization Update - David Kaplan, AMDÂ 

This talk will update the community on Linux support for the AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) features discussed in past Linux Security Summits. In particular, David will discuss the current state of hardware and open source software support, especially around the new Encrypted State (SEV-ES) feature. The talk will further discuss how AMD is working with the community to create a multi-vendor standard for VM to hypervisor communication for emulated events, and the challenges being encountered. Finally, this talk will also discuss new applications of AMD SEV technology to areas outside of traditional virtualization, such as containers (e.g. Kata Containers), and how this support may evolve in the future.
