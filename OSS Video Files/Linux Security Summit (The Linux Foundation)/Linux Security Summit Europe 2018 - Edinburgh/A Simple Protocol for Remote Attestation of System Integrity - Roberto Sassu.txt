	A Simple Protocol for Remote Attestation of System Integrity - Roberto Sassu, Huawei Technologies Duesseldorf GmbHÂ 

TPM keys can be sealed to the platform state. However, the state cannot include measurements done by Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA), as file accesses are unpredictable. The proposed IMA Digest Lists extension overcomes this issue by preloading reference measurements from software vendors into the kernel memory and reporting only unknown file accesses. This talk proposes a simple solution for remote attestation that does not require dedicated servers. An endpoint of a TLS channel can implicitly prove to the other endpoint its integrity by performing the handshake, and by providing an X.509 extension from TCG, Subject Key Attestation Evidence (SKAE), certifying that the handshake is done with a TPM key, sealed to a good system state. The talk shows how the feasibility issue of conventional solutions has been addressed and details the tradeoffs made to accomplish the objective.
