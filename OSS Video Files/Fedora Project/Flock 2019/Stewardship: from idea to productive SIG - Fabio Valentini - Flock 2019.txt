Title: Stewardship: from idea to productive SIG - Fabio Valentini - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-08-28
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	After submitting my SIG proposal in February 2019, it didn't take long to find interested people, and a productive SIG was born soon. We're now at twelve members, hold regular meetings, maintain 200 packages, and we are generally quite responsive in fixing issues that arise from newly orphaned packages, or even security issues in our package set.

The talk would focus on the current work of the Stewardship SIG, which benefits almost all of fedora, until the problems around modularity and the increasing modularization of packages have been addressed - and probably even beyond that point. This includes taking care of important orphaned packages, and steadily working on improvements and updates for our maintained packages (especially getting the Java stack updated).
