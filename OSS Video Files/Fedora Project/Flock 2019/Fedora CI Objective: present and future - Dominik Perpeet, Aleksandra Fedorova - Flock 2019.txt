Title: Fedora CI Objective: present and future - Dominik Perpeet, Aleksandra Fedorova - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-09-02
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	The Fedora CI Objective is an important piece of transforming the way all the bits of Fedora are developed and put together to work how we expect Fedora to work. We will look at where we are today in Fedora and where we want to go. From that vision we will explain the roadmap and what you can expect to change in Fedora by next Flock! Spoiler alert: It will be better.

Core areas include Rawhide stabilization, CI, Gating, distro-wide testing, automated packaging. Challenges, questions and suggestions are welcome throughout the talk!
