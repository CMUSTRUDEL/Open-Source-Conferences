Title: communishift - Kevin Fenzi - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-08-28
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	A OpenShift cluster for Fedora community managed applications.

 Introduce the  community openshift instance we have setup to allow community members to have resources to run things for the Fedora or CentOS community.

This will allow community members to run existing applications or create proof of concept applications that they fully maintain, reducing burden on the CPE team as well as providing services for the community and learning in the process.

The talk will start with some history, then on to what the hardware and setup looks like, then policies and process and finally live demo of a new app deployment.
