Description: 
	Use Fedora for IoT? What/why/how?

An overiew of Fedora IoT, what Red Hat technologies where using, and the general direction.
What use cases are we targeting, how it will work, and why won't it ever run on a thermostat?

I am Peter Robinson I'm here to talk

00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:14,320
about who what when where why how for

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,990
Fedora or IOT on Fedora or fedora on

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:22,839
i-80 depending on which way you want to

00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:26,859
look at it so the who the initiative was

00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:30,009
started by me the role was provided

00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:34,600
around three years ago to do it as a

00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:40,120
full-time by the senior vice president

00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:44,949
of rail engineering and it was my remit

00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:45,550
were is to basically investigate IAT how

00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:50,699
it would look

00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:54,339
from a fedora rail ecosystem perspective

00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:57,699
so that you know ultimately we're not

00:00:54,339 --> 00:00:59,350
starting from Ground Zero we have a

00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:03,579
small but growing community which is

00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:05,850
awesome and I actually have my first

00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:10,380
full-time team member other than me

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,380
starting on Monday so welcome Patrick

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,280
yes

00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:22,420
Patrick's role is basically a very

00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:24,360
generic IOT security so he's going to be

00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:30,520
dealing with a whole bunch of things

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:34,630
funnily enough around IT security so but

00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,760
Patrick has a talk tomorrow that where

00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,390
he'll be covering some of this which is

00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,390
very exciting

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:49,060
so who's the audience for fedora IOT

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:52,080
well the Fedora community in general

00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:55,870
because obviously we're just using

00:01:52,080 --> 00:02:00,730
fedora there's an initial focus on a

00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:02,920
number of use cases industrial IOT the

00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:07,780
term which I absolutely despise is

00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:10,320
industry for Oh oil and gas industry

00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:13,630
and we have a talk about that tomorrow

00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,860
where we actually have a Red Hat

00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:18,760
customer that is were

00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:20,620
King with us in the fedora space and so

00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,200
Chad and I will be talking about how

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,630
we're dealing with some of the problems

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,350
that the oil and gas industry has with

00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:34,060
regards to industrial control and

00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:35,890
various other bits and pieces we have a

00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:39,340
partner that's interested in smart

00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:42,250
cities automotive and a bunch of the

00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,950
community including people at the FPL

00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:48,940
are interested in home automation and

00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:52,200
smart homes I would just like someone to

00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:57,550
automate the packing of my dishwasher

00:02:52,200 --> 00:03:01,870
and it's one of the things that's quite

00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:05,020
interesting about Linux about IOT in the

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:07,390
Linux space is we're actually getting

00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:12,610
net new people

00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:14,980
we had a Doc's writer in February for

00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,650
about a month or so who massively

00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,570
improved the docs for getting started

00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,030
and one of the reasons for that was I

00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:24,130
was getting people going I've never used

00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:30,280
Linux before how do I do this from

00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:32,980
windows which from a increasing the

00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,310
Fedora community in the Fedora ecosystem

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:39,459
is a problem that we've wanted to have

00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:42,459
for some time and we've not how to an

00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:46,360
end so it's an interesting problem to

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:49,420
solve and of course there's existing

00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:52,860
fedora Enterprise Linux and related

00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:58,060
users so that's who we're talking about

00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:59,799
what it's now an official well has been

00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,739
for some time an official council

00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:06,700
objective we're moving to an edition

00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:09,250
very soon we've got a I've got a whole

00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,079
bunch of lists of things to do and

00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:15,160
there's a few other things for others to

00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:18,160
do before we make that it's obviously

00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:22,140
based on fedora standing on the shoulder

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:25,360
of giants ie the Fedora wider ecosystem

00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:28,250
using Red Hat technology such as OS 3

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:33,560
system de pod man F do I

00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:35,270
w Update Manager as I've said to a bunch

00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,330
of different people that I've spoken to

00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,740
at Red Hat over the time it's basically

00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:42,080
the same puzzle pieces building a

00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:45,620
different puzzle so all the same

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:50,980
technologies but just we're producing an

00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:55,640
IOT picture and part of my role is

00:04:50,980 --> 00:05:00,290
upstream ecosystem so the armed

00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:03,590
ecosystem through Lennar Oh engaging in

00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:07,880
standard initiatives across distros to

00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:10,280
basically help improve the SWAT or even

00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:15,050
a little bit help improve the dumpster

00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:24,050
fire that is generally IOT and so it's

00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:25,910
it's a very wide-ranging when I started

00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:29,990
in this role almost three years ago I

00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:33,350
don't know where time goes I think three

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:35,660
years will be the single longest role

00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:38,180
I've ever done in I 80 I've averaged

00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:41,540
usually two toward a bit years before

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:43,400
I've got bored and moved on and I see

00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:48,080
denise in the background shaking her

00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,760
head like my role now compared to three

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,090
years ago it doesn't look anything like

00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,160
it was three years ago yet it looks very

00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:57,410
similar to what it was three years ago

00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,300
um I don't know how I'm going to

00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,560
actually be able to get bored any time

00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,010
soon

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,470
and like every time I look back I go wow

00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:08,180
that was busy and that was fast it's not

00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,190
possible to get any busier and any

00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,700
faster and it just seems to keep her

00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:16,040
celebrating accelerating accelerating so

00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,650
our first official release was Fedora 29

00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,560
as a spin we obviously released Fedora

00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:25,790
30 we're promoting two edition really

00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:29,510
soon now we're generally doing around

00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:31,790
monthly feature releases we're starting

00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,919
we've started up it started off quite

00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:37,280
slowly like when I first started doing

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,780
this I thought three years ago it'll be

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,599
a couple of months that I'll have you

00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,350
know the first release out and holy hell

00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:45,230
I was wrong

00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:47,480
and we had all these dependencies and

00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:49,640
various other bits and pieces I wrapped

00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:53,150
and unwrapped and repackaged and dealt

00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:56,060
with and we eventually got there but

00:06:53,150 --> 00:07:02,780
it's like quicker and quicker and

00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:09,440
quicker and quicker why a traditional

00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:13,660
rpm DNF yum destroy for IOT is not that

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:17,150
great if you've ever lost power during a

00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:18,350
update and you've tried to work out

00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:21,200
whether you end up with a bootable

00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:23,450
system or not and if you if it actually

00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,960
boots how how to get it back to a

00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:29,450
consistent state doing that across tens

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:35,050
of thousands or hundreds of thousands of

00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:40,190
endpoints millions of endpoints is

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:41,810
impossible like if you've got 10 million

00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,190
endpoints are out in the field and

00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,290
you've got a roll or truck to fix them

00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:48,500
that's a problem

00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:52,340
I feel Fedora it's a good base for an

00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:54,860
IOT destroy a lot of companies of

00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:58,670
throwing like the baby out with the

00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:03,530
bathwater and not doing basic enterprise

00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:06,110
style security like shipping telnet and

00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:11,650
not disabling it and things like that

00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:14,360
and so we've got all this institutional

00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:17,240
security for enterprise and things like

00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,730
that that generally mostly just works so

00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:24,050
why throw it all away and start from the

00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:26,210
beginning again Fedora moves fast which

00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:29,270
is good like for IOT and things like

00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:32,060
that we can get the latest features and

00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:35,570
functionality in system D in kernel in

00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:37,400
toolchain which around some of the

00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:40,580
things like the kernel self protection

00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:45,350
project things like that is going to be

00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:48,260
useful from an IOT perspective and yeah

00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:51,860
so it's but you know one of the

00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:54,380
advantages we have is it's a generally

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,370
new use case we don't have legacy users

00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,640
so we can

00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:04,740
think differently and evolve stuff

00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:07,890
because we don't have j2ee platforms and

00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,810
data traditional database platforms and

00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:12,060
things like that that we have to care

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:16,230
about whether we break or not like it is

00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:19,830
net new platform from a fedora ecosystem

00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:22,170
point of view and and so we can change

00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:25,950
and evolve things and break things

00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:31,520
because we don't have a tradition of

00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:39,240
like 20 odd years of Red Hat Linux

00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:42,600
legacy how are we doing it so based on

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:46,230
rpm OS tree and other related atomic

00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:51,330
core OS technologies uses OCR contain a

00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:55,200
stack so Padma and scope EO etc a simple

00:09:51,330 --> 00:10:00,210
compose process will be supporting the

00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:04,020
image builder technology big focus on

00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:06,660
security lots of stuff around TPM - I am

00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:09,870
a system D SATCOM selinux secure boot

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,910
and all of that sort of stuff you know

00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:14,160
ultimately it's a similar to the data

00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:17,370
center but without the physical security

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,080
so things like storing all the

00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,710
credentials in TPM so they're not

00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,940
recoverable even from a running OS is

00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:27,960
useful in the data center and a lot of

00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:30,270
like security focused companies would be

00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,890
interested in it but probably not as

00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:34,350
interested to say the latest version of

00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:37,260
kubernetes or OpenShift or whatever it

00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:42,270
happens to be whereas when you go and

00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:44,370
strap a device to a light pole or a oil

00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:46,740
pump or something like that out in the

00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:49,170
field you don't have that physical data

00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:52,610
center security so device security and

00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:55,110
things like that is of critical focus

00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:57,210
yeah so we're currently at what I would

00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:03,360
consider a first phase Minimum Viable

00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:06,540
Product and we're moving quickly so some

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,840
of the core components that we're sort

00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:15,240
of building on top or

00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:17,730
of this MVB in the P layer and things

00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:21,180
like oh s updates automatic update

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:23,340
rollback auto-scale out of updates so

00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,950
start to trickle out updates to devices

00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:28,560
and then scale up or scale back

00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:33,990
depending on what sort of success rate

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:35,970
you get OS config management so people

00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:38,640
are like well just use ansible and like

00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:42,300
well yes but if you've got ten million

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:46,170
devices and that are not necessarily

00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:48,300
always online an answer will run could

00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:52,380
take months to complete so you need a

00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:54,210
concept of eventual consistency and I

00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,970
don't know that there's a server out

00:11:54,210 --> 00:12:00,510
there that ansible could run on to hit

00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:04,020
ten million devices yeah app management

00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:05,550
and updates around that well that's

00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:08,220
going to look something like kubernetes

00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:09,630
to some degree but kubernetes running on

00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:14,850
a device with two gig of ram at the

00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:18,030
moment is interesting some form of

00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:21,000
device management so hardware failures

00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:23,630
firmware updates things like that and

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,820
provisioning support and standardization

00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:29,850
we're looking at ignition from core OS

00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:33,360
for this but it's missing a lot of stuff

00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:36,060
that i is sort of on the nice-to-have

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,100
for them but critical for us so things

00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:42,900
like TPM provisioning device encryption

00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:44,990
stuff like that and how do we support

00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,610
the deployment of millions of devices

00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:50,550
and and there's a lot of initiatives

00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:53,430
around that from companies like and

00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:55,860
Intel and that but none of them are

00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:58,140
standardized and none of them are open

00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:01,770
standards they're all very much how do

00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:03,330
we lock you into as you are AWS various

00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:06,450
other bits and pieces like that and

00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:09,690
that's great but overall there needs to

00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:14,310
be an industry-wide standard for secure

00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:16,290
deployment of that and I mentioned you

00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:21,140
know eventual consistency for

00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:23,730
occasionally connected devices where I'm

00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:27,299
so the usual space

00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:29,939
we have an IOT landing page which links

00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:34,470
to basically all of this we have a

00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:38,309
Kanban board Twitter IRC all the usual

00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:42,169
Fedora communication mediums and that's

00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:42,169
me does anyone have any questions

00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:07,019
software-defined radio untested um it's

00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:09,720
it's certainly a use case like a lot of

00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:12,899
this stuff like I only have so many

00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,339
hours in a day and like sometimes you

00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:16,949
know ensuring things like the Raspberry

00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:20,209
Pi actually boot and take a large chunk

00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:23,730
of time and things like that and so

00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:25,980
things like SDR I like in the back of my

00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:28,980
mind that people would be interested in

00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:41,370
it and so if there's people interested

00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:42,540
in the community I'm around well so it

00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,360
depends on the use case

00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:49,410
so from an SDR point of view I've not

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:53,279
had I mean that there's we've got

00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:54,720
obviously Wi-Fi and wired Ethernet like

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,980
in a factory it's probably actually

00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:02,339
going to be wired Ethernet

00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:03,380
they're like 5g is a topic I talk about

00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:05,639
quite a bit

00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:07,470
SDR is certainly an option it's not

00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:11,550
something that I've spoken to a lot of

00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:16,100
companies about so from that perspective

00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:16,100
it it just comes down to focus on time

00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:39,260
I know so we're not focused on emcee use

00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:42,530
one of the use cases I'm working on with

00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:47,930
the armored ecosystem is using like

00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:52,220
fedora IOT as a gateway to MC use so so

00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:56,870
zephyr us zephyr artis is like an

00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:59,150
open-source real-time OS for like a

00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,920
whole bunch of different MC use and I

00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:03,920
work quite closely with a number of

00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:06,230
companies that are working on that so

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,210
the idea is that like this would be a

00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:11,720
gateway to those devices where they're

00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:14,600
connected by bluetooth mesh or 802 15

00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,330
for all those sort of technologies or in

00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,760
some cases like hardwired with can is

00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:22,780
another way of communicating and then

00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:27,370
this would be sort of the gateway for

00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:27,370
those devices depending on what they do

00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,730
yep

00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:48,610
yeah and like I've had in the back of my

00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:50,590
mind that things like SDR and amateur

00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:53,730
radio would be a use case that a lot of

00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,730
people would be interested in

00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:22,840
yeah and I understand that but there

00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:25,840
that is not the only bit of a IOT like

00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:27,880
if you go into a factory there will be

00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,680
basically no wireless at all because of

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,230
the big machines just kill the signal

00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:35,710
and everything will be hardwired so if

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:37,510
you're you I mean I speak we I've spoken

00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:42,190
with literally hundreds of companies

00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:43,840
with thousands of use cases and like one

00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:45,670
of the companies I'm working with has

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,540
like well over a hundred different use

00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:52,990
cases and that's one company and and so

00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:56,950
like everyone you speak to has a

00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:59,770
different idea of what IOT is it's a bit

00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:02,020
like trying to define cloud 5-10 years

00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:06,070
ago everyone had a different idea as to

00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:09,160
what cloud was IOT is basically that

00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:14,740
squared at the moment it wait there is

00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:19,480
literally billions of use cases anyone

00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:23,520
else oh I'm going to get off quite

00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,520
lightly with this excellent

00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,600
so the question is how much of the

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,870
security work will go into the other

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,370
editions it will all be available so

00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:42,260
some of the stuff we're looking at doing

00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,850
around like the system D lockdown stuff

00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:46,520
and that will probably break a lot of

00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:49,370
stuff I actively want to break that in

00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:51,320
the IOT use case for the general use

00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:54,830
case that's probably not such a good

00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:57,740
idea but it will like it will all be

00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:59,540
going into so some of the work that

00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:01,490
Patrick will be focused on will be

00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:04,610
around t PM's and stuff like that and

00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:06,530
that will be going into fedora and into

00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:11,420
the upstream community for any other

00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:15,050
destroy and so things like integrity

00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:19,070
measurement and attestation stuff in the

00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:21,620
kernel like it's enabled in rawhide now

00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:24,560
and it will be a default allow policy in

00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:28,610
Fedora in general the i/o we're going to

00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:32,570
have an active policy in Fedora IAT to

00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:35,680
enforce and measure stuff for a

00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:41,960
general-purpose OS that will break

00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:44,560
I I don't care well I do care but I'm

00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,450
going to be actively opinionated on

00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:51,680
breaking stuff in IOT so that we can

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:55,520
actively fix it and and make things work

00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:57,290
in a much more focused manner and of

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,690
course all of that stuff will roll into

00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:01,880
the standard destroy but there'll be

00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:04,400
different policies that people can turn

00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:13,960
on enable and force what have you

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:13,960
depending on what they want to do yes

00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:26,280
yep yes so we're primarily focused on

00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:29,900
running the application stacks in

00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:32,580
containers as opposed to on the base OS

00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,430
simply because they're more easy to

00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:38,400
update and that's the general direction

00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:41,730
Enterprise is going as a whole and you

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:44,970
know a lot of one of the things that a

00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:47,670
number of like people are excited about

00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:50,550
is that basically they can use the same

00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:54,600
workflow they do in the data center on

00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:57,090
i-80 without sort of changing things so

00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:00,150
they can have the same app dev process

00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:01,890
for containers on the edge or for

00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,390
applications on the edge that they do in

00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:07,740
the data center say running on open

00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:10,770
shifts style stuff so you will be able

00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:14,370
to do layering and things like that as a

00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:16,680
whole that can be quite problematic it's

00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:20,100
randomly broken a number of times in

00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:25,200
rawhide of late and needed to be fixed

00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:27,810
and so but you know so there and it's

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,940
interesting because there's at least six

00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:31,590
or seven startups that I'm aware of that

00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:36,830
are actually playing around and using

00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:40,080
fedora IOT in products which is cool and

00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:42,450
some of them and like I had a question

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,900
on the mailing list the other day how do

00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:47,400
I do

00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:50,100
NPM install or pip install on a like a

00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:56,550
rpm OS tree read-only file system and

00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:59,310
it's like you don't so they're they're

00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:01,410
basically bundling it all into a big RPM

00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:03,600
and layering it on top and I'm like if

00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:06,360
you want to do that it'll work

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,250
but it's not going to be our primary way

00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,560
of dealing with this because I mean

00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:12,510
ultimately the advantage of containers

00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,980
is you can run four or five containers

00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:16,140
alongside each other and they're

00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:19,230
completely isolated from each other so

00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,720
if some crappy IOT application decides

00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:23,340
to start doing bad things it's isolated

00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,710
and doesn't affect the other devices on

00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:27,830
the other applications running on the

00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,830
device

00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,500
well thank you everybody I'll be around

00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:45,860
I have one other talk and we have a hack

00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:49,309
Fest on Saturday I think Patrick will be

00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:51,020
giving his security talk tomorrow

00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:53,559
and you know feel free to come and ask

00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,559
