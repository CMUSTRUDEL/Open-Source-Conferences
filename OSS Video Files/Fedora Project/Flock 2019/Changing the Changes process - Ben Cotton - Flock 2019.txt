Title: Changing the Changes process - Ben Cotton - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-08-28
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	The Changes process is how we coordinate new work in Fedora. But like any process, it's not perfect. In this talk, the Fedora Program Manager will discuss changes to the Changes process that will allow for better automation. It will also review why the Changes process is the way it is.

I won't introduce myself because you all

00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:09,150
know me and you all now have seen that

00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:11,799
the talk is changing the changes process

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,750
so I have some boilerplate I have to

00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:15,670
start out with so let's talk about it if

00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,650
you want to say nice things you can

00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,360
there's my Twitter handle if you want to

00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,100
say not nice things you can send them to

00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,110
dev null if you have like actual

00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,880
constructive things to talk about

00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:28,960
nobody ever shows up to this but I do

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:32,379
hold weekly office hours in IRC you you

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:38,650
do sometimes it's because you don't get

00:00:32,379 --> 00:00:44,110
my community blog posts apparently okay

00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:49,510
well now you know if every word I write

00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:52,000
is golden you should read like so what

00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:54,550
we're gonna talk about in the next 24

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,280
minutes is a little bit of background

00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:59,079
about why we have a changes process what

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,239
the process is just kind of as a

00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:02,500
reminder you know most of you are fairly

00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:04,689
familiar with it but I feel like it's

00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,039
always good to kind of nudge people and

00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:09,310
this way I'm not calling out anyone

00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:11,409
specifically then we talk about why

00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,479
we're changing what we're changing and

00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:17,409
then oh no what if it's terrible and

00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:20,289
what we do beyond that so why have it

00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:23,020
changes process if you were at my change

00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:26,409
it change management and open source

00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:28,329
projects talk at DEFCON the next few

00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:30,549
minutes will seem very familiar but I

00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:33,069
condensed the 50 minutes down to much

00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:36,639
smaller than that so I'm not gonna get

00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:38,469
into like the more broader theory but

00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:40,689
basically start out with what a change

00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:43,179
is we're talking here about technical

00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:47,049
changes to features or processes things

00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:51,069
that we ship to our users or ways and

00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:52,689
that we build the things that we ship so

00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,429
why do we have a process for this it's

00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:57,880
not just to keep me employed although I

00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:59,639
do really appreciate getting paid it's

00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,289
communication and these are all

00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:03,549
different variations of me saying the

00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,919
word communication but it looks better

00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:07,959
to have multiple bullets on the on the

00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:09,340
slide so what does it mean by

00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:12,220
communication well we want to

00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,550
communicate with each other for there's

00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,230
a large group of

00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,240
people who contribute to fedora in some

00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:20,060
way and it's really hard to keep up with

00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,740
everything that goes on if you subscribe

00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,510
to a lot of the mailing lists you mostly

00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,070
are really good at this marking emails

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:28,450
as read or just dealing with the fact

00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:31,010
that you have a thousand unread messages

00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,960
it's good to get feedback sometimes

00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:37,160
people propose changes that are really

00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:40,430
bad I'd like to point out that Matthew

00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:43,880
submitted a change to basically get some

00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,620
very raw and anonymous numbers from DNF

00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,040
and it was like actually that's kind of

00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,050
Shady

00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:54,740
and what happened they came up with a

00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:56,090
better idea we had recently the I'm not

00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,070
here to pass judgment I'm just

00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:02,210
reflecting the values of the community

00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:04,850
back to you so you know and sometimes

00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:06,680
it's yeah this is a great idea but this

00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,480
is gonna affect me in this way and I

00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,000
need time to do this so can I put it off

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,590
or can we do this thing you know there's

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,960
a lot of coordination that happens and

00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:17,510
then more communication right so like

00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,430
not just as we are implementing the

00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:21,620
change and shipping it but it'd be good

00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,450
to tell people about what we've done one

00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,940
because it's nice to get you know

00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:27,920
coverage of our work and that people

00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,510
recognize it and they say oh yeah fedora

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,800
I should you know go install the new

00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,950
release because it's got all this cool

00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,890
stuff and getting that into the release

00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:38,570
notes as part of the changes process

00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,910
everything we ever say is immediately

00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:42,590
turned into a fir onyx article so you

00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,970
know never come up with any bad ideas on

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,750
the mailing list because everyone will

00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:50,570
assume that's what we're doing a hook

00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:52,459
process a very wise person said

00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:54,830
developers don't actually hate process

00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:57,950
that just when they when it works they

00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:00,200
call it culture and you know part of the

00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,510
reason people think they hate process is

00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,570
sometimes the process isn't scaled to

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:07,459
the thing so I use this you know as an

00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,230
example is like inferred or we have a

00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:11,690
relatively heavy process because it's a

00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,970
really big dynamic community with lots

00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,560
of moving parts people who are doing

00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:17,630
stuff because Red Hat pays them to

00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,130
people who work at Red Hat and are doing

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,269
stuff because they want to people who

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,039
are just doing stuff because they like

00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:23,780
being in the Fedora community and they

00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:26,910
don't have any real association with Red

00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,710
Hat on the other hand there's a

00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,320
Twitter client that I maintain where I'm

00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,360
the only maintainer and there's still

00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,560
some users but people mostly moved on to

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,020
other tools at this point

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,760
so really the changed process is been

00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,320
sits down decides he wants to code

00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,840
something he pushes it and maybe he

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,670
calls it a release at some point not a

00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,290
lot of communication goes on I actually

00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:52,620
don't spend a lot of time talking to

00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:55,890
myself so what is fedoras process well

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:59,310
back in the old days prior to fedora 20

00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:01,440
we had the features process and the main

00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,630
question of the features process is is

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,480
this a feature or an enhancement and

00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:08,550
people had to make that judgment call

00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:11,610
and it turns out it wasn't a great

00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:14,400
process when I was doing some research

00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:18,270
on this - you know sort of see what was

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,800
going on I found this comment on a blog

00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,300
post from somebody in the community

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,900
replying to somebody else in the

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,220
community and basically the gist of it

00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,280
is I'm not to sit here make you try and

00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,430
squint at it the gist is why should we

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,590
do this because all it does is make work

00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:36,900
and that was really true because how we

00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,520
tracked the progress of changes was you

00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,130
went in if you were the change owner and

00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,750
you edited the wiki page and said I am X

00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,480
percent done now and you were supposed

00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:48,210
to do that you're fairly often and you

00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,760
know people Kansas went with 20 40 60 80

00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:53,910
100 when they remembered to do it which

00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:57,000
was almost never and it wasn't really

00:05:53,910 --> 00:06:00,270
meaningful because 80 being 80% done

00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,140
means you've barely started right so it

00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:05,460
wasn't really that helpful so people

00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,350
started complaining people start being

00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,300
unhappy so the Fedora engineering

00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,490
steering committee they identified a few

00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,550
issues that didn't work about the

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,620
features process feature is very

00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,090
ambiguous people thought it should be a

00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,380
feature but is actually an enhancement

00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:21,870
some people thought was an enhancement

00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,070
it really is a feature and some people

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,570
didn't think it was either but it really

00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,860
should have been one of the other and

00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:30,510
like nobody really knew what it meant

00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,180
there were a lot of different wiki pages

00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:36,270
that all asked for the same information

00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:38,040
which was a real pain it didn't account

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,620
for different types or scopes of

00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,199
features so if you wanted to add a new

00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,360
Desktop environment that was the same as

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,449
you know if you said let's replace the

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,490
Linux kernel with BSD they used the same

00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:55,080
process even though they are very much

00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:57,090
not the same scope and the process

00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,070
really didn't make the the feature

00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:01,620
proposals visible to that visible to the

00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:03,780
community until after they were approved

00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,250
like after fresco said yep this is good

00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:09,270
then I was like okay we're going to do

00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:10,740
this thing now and vesco is pretty great

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,780
shout out to all the festival members in

00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,940
the room but there's only nine of them

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,610
and they can only identify so many

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,530
problems and having the community

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,449
interaction early in the process is

00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:25,740
really good for identifying some

00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:27,539
problems before they get implemented so

00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,060
my predecessors predecessor helped

00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:32,610
device design a new progress process

00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,050
that we started using in Fedora 20 and

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:37,500
it's really similar to the features

00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:41,039
process but it's better it's probably 80

00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:43,440
70 80 percent the same but now we don't

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,050
think about feature or enhancement

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,910
because those are not really helpful so

00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,639
we distinguish between system-wide and

00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:52,620
self-contained changes and let's be

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,780
honest we have trouble making those

00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,030
distinctions sometimes too but it's a

00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,950
little more clear does somebody else

00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,870
have to do work because of you all right

00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:03,419
it's probably a system-wide change is

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,680
the work contained to you or the group

00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:06,180
you're working with to propose the

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,120
change all right it's probably

00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,949
self-contained it's there's we still

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,130
have the the rough edges but it makes a

00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:16,050
little more sense now and changes aren't

00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:19,110
necessarily shipped code most of the

00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:21,510
changes are some things are like oh

00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,949
we're gonna change we're gonna change

00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:25,050
what's included in the default build

00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:26,729
route the end user is never gonna

00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,010
actually care about that because if the

00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:31,080
package builds the package builds but

00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:33,240
community contributors that's important

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,370
because all of a sudden oh crap you have

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:41,729
to update my spec file so my package is

00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:43,409
still build so the the process is fairly

00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:45,240
similar for self-contained and

00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:46,589
system-wide changes but system-wide

00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,260
changes because they're a little bigger

00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:51,570
we ask a little more of the the owners

00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,300
for that we have they have to have

00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,680
contingency plans test plans

00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,300
have to say what the impact on the other

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,779
developers is what the impact on

00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:03,000
upgrades is so if you go from Fedora 30

00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:05,399
to fedora 31 and this changes and

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,330
implemented will you accidentally wipe

00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:11,130
the users hard drive that's if that's

00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,140
listed in the change proposal I get I'm

00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,570
guessing it will probably be rejected

00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:19,740
but it's good to identify these things

00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:22,260
right and so the way the flow kind of

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,779
works is the change owner drafts a

00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:27,240
proposal and a wiki page they check with

00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:29,670
release engineering if they have to we

00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,079
have some we've made fewer people that

00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,700
have to do that because I was tired of

00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:34,890
having mohon have to go in and like yep

00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:38,670
it's fine yep it's fine yep it's fine

00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:40,019
like it's a waste of his time if there

00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,459
is a trademark approval needed cuz

00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,839
they're making a new spin or doing

00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:44,279
something they have to go to the council

00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,410
and the council s the the authority

00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:48,750
authority to be like yes this is a good

00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:50,010
use of our trademark and then if there's

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,380
some policy changes like around

00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:54,690
packaging the packaging committee is the

00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:57,720
gatekeeper for that and then they go and

00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,970
mark the page the wiki page ready by

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,620
setting it to a category and hoping they

00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:05,279
don't miss type the category because

00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:08,010
then it gets lost and so then I go in

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,600
every so often and you know i refresh

00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,459
through the pages what's the pages in

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,329
that category and I say oh good there's

00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:17,160
some new ones so I change regular posts

00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:18,660
a change proposal really simplifies that

00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,450
I have to go through like grab the

00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:24,480
source copy into an email delete all the

00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:26,370
markup in the comments and make sure the

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,110
link is there and like make sure I type

00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,360
the the version number right and the

00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,970
subject and I copy and pasted the the

00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,410
title right and if you've seen the

00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,420
change proposals I've sent out in the

00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,699
last year there's like a one in 20

00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,040
chance that something is wrong I've put

00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:42,990
them I've said system-wide when I meant

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,970
you know self-contained or vice-versa

00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,440
I've typed the wrong version number

00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:50,399
because who knows what the hell version

00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:52,589
of Fedora we're releasing I I'm not very

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,579
good at this like I cannot copy paste

00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:58,760
well so anyway that happens we give it a

00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,760
week

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,870
so after a week the community you know

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,370
offers their feedback you know it's

00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,110
always constructive they always have

00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,780
these great ideas that add on to it it's

00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:15,660
never just empty complaining and then I

00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:18,000
copy and paste more stuff into a fess KO

00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:20,190
ticket and then fess ko generally within

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,960
a week sometimes really faster than that

00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,180
but they go through and they you know

00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,220
approve it or reject it sometimes

00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,510
they'll go back and say can you add more

00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,820
to this page we're not really sure what

00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:32,820
we're voting on or like hey this would

00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:35,810
be great but like there's a concern

00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:38,100
address it or you're getting can

00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:41,130
sowhat's assume fess ko accepts the

00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:43,590
change I hand out a shiny new badge the

00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:45,480
the change owner does the work to

00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,980
implement it and people never do the

00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,940
implementation and then go back like oh

00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,870
I should probably submit a change

00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:54,630
proposal for that no that never happens

00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:57,180
and then we evaluate contingency plans

00:11:54,630 --> 00:12:02,010
where there were applicable at the beta

00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:03,750
freeze usually sometimes changes are

00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,340
actually like the contingency plans only

00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,750
need to be invoked until final freeze

00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,220
because it's something kind of small or

00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:11,160
maybe it's sooner because it involves a

00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,560
mass rebuild but like for most part it's

00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:17,190
at beta freeze or some random date that

00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,810
sometimes people just put in and so we

00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,420
have a timeline basically working back

00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:24,060
from the beta freeze you know code

00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,560
complete 100% code complete testable we

00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,940
start a mass rebuild to have a deadline

00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,790
for submitting so it actually can go

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:33,780
through the process so that's your

00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:37,710
reminder of how the process works so why

00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:43,380
are we changing anything I'm selfish I'm

00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:45,330
lazy and I make a lot of mistakes yeah I

00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,610
mean the the selfish parts of the self

00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:49,440
deprecating but in all honesty a lot of

00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:52,200
it is like this is just a giant pain in

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,820
the butt for me and like all this

00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,800
copying and pasting is not a valuable

00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,800
use of my time that I could be doing

00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,890
other things for the community and yeah

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,990
that's kind of ties into being lazy you

00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:05,610
know I am a former assisted min so I'm

00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:10,080
always trying to automate myself out of

00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:11,670
a job and yeah I mean I wanted with a 1

00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,139
in 20 chance that something is wrong

00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:16,259
when I sent the email or I put

00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:18,179
the wrong link to the developer in the

00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:21,720
fest co ticket or i did something like

00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:24,420
it's just annoying the other thing I

00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,759
didn't put on there is the the dark

00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,850
magic of how we actually generate the

00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:32,639
bugzilla issues once the change is

00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,799
accepted there's a Perl script that

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,929
parses the text of the wiki page and

00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,730
hopes it does the right thing of pulling

00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:43,889
out the summary and the title and the

00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:49,939
change owner and shoving that into into

00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:52,799
the Bugzilla and mostly it works right

00:13:49,939 --> 00:13:54,419
mostly it works because Perl is really

00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:57,239
good at parsing text and stuff but

00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:59,189
sometimes people just do something just

00:13:57,239 --> 00:14:01,619
unexpected enough that I have to go in

00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:03,480
like manually edit the page before I can

00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:04,889
run the script and then I find out the

00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,660
email address they had for themselves in

00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:08,100
the wiki page isn't there bugzilla email

00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,579
address in bugs I was like I'm not gonna

00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:18,119
create this bug I don't know who this is

00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:20,459
it's fun so as I'm doing this you know

00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:22,470
my idea was like I want to make these

00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,819
changes to make my life better I don't

00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:27,299
want to make everyone else's life worse

00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:29,339
one because I have no ability to force

00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:31,350
anyone to do anything like if we were

00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:32,910
all red hat employees working on a red

00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,139
hat product I could call people's

00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,910
managers and be like hey they're not

00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,529
being a team player can you do something

00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:41,579
they'd be like no but at least I'd have

00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:43,619
that option in a you know in my view

00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:45,239
everyone working on Fedora is doing it

00:14:43,619 --> 00:14:47,489
in a volunteer capacity that's the way I

00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:50,009
think of it because that's the that's

00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:52,529
the same default and it's true to some

00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:54,749
degree for a lot of people so it's

00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:56,360
really you know I have to try and make

00:14:54,749 --> 00:14:58,439
it something that people can accept

00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:02,009
somebody else said changing people's

00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:03,600
workflow is unpopular and so this is how

00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:05,279
I'm gonna burn all the political capital

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,549
I've developed in the last year doing

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,559
this job by changing things for you but

00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:12,600
yeah so really it's I want it to be

00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,369
something where you don't really notice

00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:18,480
if you're a change owner that much

00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:20,039
difference and I really want to automate

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,610
things because I'm gonna have fewer

00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:25,529
mistakes I can do things faster and

00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,420
spend more time doing other things in

00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:28,790
Fedora

00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:31,490
and part of that is by setting out

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,530
separating out metadata like we don't we

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,420
shouldn't be parsing the wiki text to

00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,920
get people's email addresses we can just

00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,780
say here's the field where you enter

00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,980
your email address here's the field

00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,810
where you say this is a self-contained

00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,240
change or this is a system-wide change

00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,590
you can just do things and they're

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,000
separate and you can treat them

00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:51,560
separately and operate on them

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:55,730
separately so with all of that said what

00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:58,670
are we changing nothing we sort of like

00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:01,280
the actual from the business part of the

00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:03,260
process isn't changing the flow still

00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,450
happens basically the same way it's just

00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,310
sort of an implementation detail about

00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:23,480
how this is gonna work changing some

00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:26,260
tooling I have nothing but nice things

00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,970
to say from here on out

00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:31,130
yes it's basically the same process but

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,570
just a new tool we're using the taiga

00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:35,120
instance that teams that Fedora project

00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:38,300
or org if you were in Matthews to talk

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,560
this morning he mentioned that so so

00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:46,610
what does it look like well you just

00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:48,110
create an issue and just custom fields

00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:51,110
they're gonna get some of the stuff we

00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:53,240
want but then like a lot of the body of

00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:56,060
like the actual content of what you're

00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,190
proposing to change it's still just

00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:00,980
there except now you can use markdown

00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:02,900
which is a lot easier it's so much

00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,540
easier and if you keep going if you're

00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:07,579
switching back from markdown - MediaWiki

00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:10,310
- back to markdown you never get the

00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:12,470
formatting right you can also do it in

00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:23,750
HTML if you really want to but I don't

00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:26,600
know why you would yeah but yeah so like

00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:28,880
and again like if there's you know if

00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,800
you have some people have a list of like

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,270
they use the wiki macros like get

00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,700
package status and stuff you could still

00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,560
point out to a wiki page as like further

00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:40,100
details but you can still have the

00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:42,290
content there or

00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,890
you can use a handy new CLI tool and

00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:52,400
just do it all from the command line so

00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:54,320
yeah so it better work so the idea is

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,000
like a lot of the work you're doing is

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,860
happening in the command line you know

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,740
at a terminal anyway you know you're

00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:02,240
making eye commits to your spec file and

00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,820
pushing that so like what if you just

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,590
add then you went and then you had an

00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,870
editor come up that you entered your

00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:10,490
text in and then you could possibly

00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:12,110
create a really sunjin earing ticket if

00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,370
needed and like all that magic just

00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,230
happened and you never even had to open

00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:18,950
your web browser that'd be kind of cool

00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:23,690
right so if you want to see more about

00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:25,760
the the tool coming to the summer coding

00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:28,070
showcase Saturday morning an office will

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,350
have about 10 minutes to to talk about

00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:32,870
it so it'll be a pretty quick overview

00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:34,580
I'd really hoped we'd be at a point

00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,990
where I could like we'd have like a

00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,540
final version and some documentation I

00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:41,120
could show you stuff and the reason

00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:43,490
where you're not at that point is me so

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,230
I'll take the heat off of you for that

00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:49,190
like that's that's entirely on me not

00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:50,960
having enough time in the day so yeah so

00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:53,420
you're submitting your proposals as tige

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,580
issues that then processing happens in

00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:58,130
an automated fashion I type a command

00:18:55,580 --> 00:19:02,120
and give it the issue number and it does

00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:04,070
the thing it sends the email and it sets

00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,800
the reply to so that it doesn't keep

00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:08,870
going to develop to keep going back and

00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,640
rejecting people's replies to develop

00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:12,350
outs because that's not useful use of

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,230
that list so hey that's an improvement

00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:16,670
right there already then it creates you

00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:20,000
know when I type the next command it

00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:22,250
creates the the fescue issue when it's

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,440
accepted it converts it to a user story

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:27,080
and we create the release notes issue

00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,360
and create the Bugzilla and i don't have

00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,550
to copy and paste stuff which means the

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:36,980
thing that you will look at is actually

00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:38,960
correct and will will still produce HTML

00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:42,890
changeset summaries can't we have on the

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:45,320
wiki page except why deal with the wiki

00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:48,020
when we could just write an HTML file

00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:55,380
and put it on the web

00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:57,179
yes because there was so there was there

00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:00,030
was enough feedback that people like to

00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:04,080
use Bugzilla like the change tracker

00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:07,910
bugs to tie in other bugs like to be

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,910
related or you know blockers and stuff

00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:16,770
yeah yeah so it's like somebody's for

00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:19,500
example retiring Python - they might

00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:30,090
link a lot of bugs against the period of

00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:30,809
Python to change proposal so what if

00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:34,980
it's terrible

00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:38,550
I be taiga has some issues it's not a

00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:40,290
perfect tool people already know the

00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:42,960
wiki they kind of like it some people

00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:44,610
just reven refused I actually got that

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,580
feedback like there's like no the wiki

00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,780
works and I'm gonna keep doing it a

00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:51,630
there's hundreds of us we all have our

00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:54,390
preferences it's fine here's the thing

00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:56,730
if it's terrible we can go back the wiki

00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:59,190
still exists we can find another way to

00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:01,920
do it like we can do stuff and I will do

00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:03,630
the copy pasting for you and the hopes

00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,820
that I can do it correctly and if it's

00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:08,250
wrong well there's only so much I can do

00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,620
about that but again like you know I

00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:12,330
really this I'm treating this as sort of

00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,429
an experimental thing like we're gonna

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:17,000
try it for a while and we'll we'll

00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:21,030
improve upon it and if it just

00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,950
unacceptably bad forever it's not that's

00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:25,440
not the change owners fault that it

00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:27,300
sucked so we'll go you know I will take

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,420
the time to clean things up for them

00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:33,320
because I'm nice no matter what Matthew

00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:36,059
says about me all right so what's next

00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:38,100
like I said I really hope we'd have the

00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:40,440
CLI tool done

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,120
I just kept not testing it and not

00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,309
giving the nos feedback and so it makes

00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:47,700
it really hard for him to you know fix

00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:48,840
things and get the polish done so then

00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,429
what we'll finish write up some

00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,110
documentation he's actually written a

00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:54,300
lot of good documentation of the usage

00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:55,710
of the command line tool itself but we

00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:58,590
need to document like the change to how

00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:00,120
you actually submit it and gosh there's

00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,260
a whole bunch of wiki pages that I keep

00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,420
meaning to put in

00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:05,940
to dock stuff for the world project org

00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:08,070
and I just never get to it cuz man

00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,780
that's you got a block out its knees

00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:12,570
like sit down like this is my afternoon

00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:17,760
where I shut everything except the wiki

00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:20,370
content and the git repo we already have

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,840
some accepted for 32 proposals including

00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,730
this one we actually ran this through

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,620
the changes process which made me a

00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:27,570
little nervous but then I was able to

00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:35,370
bribe Fusco into accepting it so that

00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:40,790
was great I was able to use my powers of

00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:40,790
persuasion and beg Festo for leniency

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:50,370
and so you know as we do it for fedora

00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,990
32 you know in the next few weeks this

00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,490
will be ready so most of change

00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:57,300
proposals will be submitted through this

00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:58,590
and we're gonna if we're gonna find

00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,680
things that are bad about it so we'll

00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:02,940
fix those if we can but then mostly

00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,070
it'll be done and I'll find something

00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,330
else to improve I already have some

00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,410
thoughts about the release readiness

00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,930
meeting and then I will be happy to

00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:11,880
share them later but it'll be a much

00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:14,580
that's like a real improvement that

00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,980
everyone can get behind I hope and so

00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,990
with that I am about at time I don't

00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,150
want to keep people from dinner so I

00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:23,400
will stick around for questions but

00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,600
don't feel obligated to to sit here and

00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,110
wait if you'd rather go be doing

00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,110
anything else

00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:23,940
[Music]

00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:32,150
so to sum it up the the concern raised

00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:33,920
is that we have a lot of things that

00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:35,210
look very similar to this and we're

00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,270
solving them with sort of custom

00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:41,030
solutions instead of just using pull

00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:43,310
requests and get I would argue that

00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:47,000
anything that involves processing text

00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:49,190
is not a good fit for a pull a pull

00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,440
request because you can't separate the

00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:53,440
metadata from the data as easily

00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,969
[Music]

00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:52,280
yeah I want to go ahead and pause on the

00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:54,050
general discussion and make sure there

00:26:52,280 --> 00:27:09,650
you know I take any other questions

00:26:54,050 --> 00:27:31,010
about this specifically Matthew yes I

00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:33,560
did I didn't mention that so the

00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:34,940
question was well will the user stories

00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,190
move through and that yes that is one of

00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:39,620
the things so right now the the source

00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:42,050
of truth is the Bugzilla issue so if you

00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:44,450
set it to modified you set it to on cue

00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:46,430
a wet cetera so one of the things that

00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:48,410
will happen is there's a script that

00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:50,420
basically checks the bugzilla status and

00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:53,150
puts the card in the right category so

00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:56,270
you do get that dashboard view and then

00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:57,800
so each each release is an epoch in

00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:59,960
taiga so you can just look at like the

00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:02,420
Fedora 32 changes or you can look at all

00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,860
of them and see where you easily see

00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:06,110
what state they're in as opposed to like

00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:08,120
looking right now it's the wiki page you

00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:09,620
have to look through each entry and like

00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,500
all right which one's that okay yeah

00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:15,070
okay so yes you do get the sort of

00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,070
dashboard view

00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:30,789
that senior engineer gamely filled out

00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:36,570
the change page and then sometime after

00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:36,570
the deadline had product manager so

00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:09,090
that's one and so I had originally come

00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:11,980
up with this idea and using packer as

00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:14,230
the source of truth I started talking

00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:15,429
people about this last fall and then

00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:17,559
taiga became available was like oh

00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:19,360
that's actually for like the dashboard

00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:20,860
kind of view stuff that's actually a

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,220
much better fit for this kind of

00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,220
workflow

00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:59,350
I I'm not sure I understand the concern

00:29:50,429 --> 00:30:02,020
oh all be in one place is that is that

00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:03,460
the like so PR would be just the

00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,170
conversation would happen in the pole

00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:41,620
request as opposed I con mailing lists

00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:43,179
and things like that right yeah so in a

00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:46,690
lot of ways this is very similar to how

00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:49,030
the wiki based workflow works yeah it's

00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,679
like and that's you know it's like there

00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:52,600
are things we could probably do better

00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:53,919
but on the other hand like it's also a

00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,010
way like make it a little more

00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,360
incremental so like right now once I

00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,950
edit a wiki page I get email

00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,780
notifications if someone changes it we

00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:07,390
could do the same with you know tracking

00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:09,970
the status and nice thing about Tyga

00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:11,500
versus a packer is you know for like

00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:13,360
issues and stuff you can actually see

00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,429
that the edits were made and see what

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:20,290
they were so I could little better

00:31:15,429 --> 00:31:21,730
version control for the more general

00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:23,049
case you're talking about I'd love to

00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:24,960
have a good solution for that because I

00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:27,429
think there are a lot of things where we

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,500
would benefit from a more generalizable

00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:32,669
solution but I don't know what that

00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,669
looks like in a way

00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:32,330
was doing the thing where we could do

00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:34,249
all the stuff in pattern and there would

00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:36,529
be hope for an integration that leader

00:33:34,249 --> 00:33:38,809
push issues or data was put in the repo

00:33:36,529 --> 00:33:40,639
and the st. the state straight into

00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:42,440
title for the dashboard representation

00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:44,509
while still maintaining the source of

00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,309
information in tiger and that would also

00:33:44,509 --> 00:33:48,049
allow us to do bi-directional plugging

00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:50,330
across different services because

00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:53,029
everything that happens in Packer is

00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:54,619
already sorted out as messages and then

00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:56,220
that allows us to change that other

00:33:54,619 --> 00:34:39,280
service

00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:46,960
but we didn't get there'll be templates

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:49,120
for ya just I mean it's certainly

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,490
possible it's just sort of a at some

00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,200
point it's not worth separating like a

00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:55,690
lot of a lot of these things when it's

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,330
basically and honestly now that we have

00:34:55,690 --> 00:35:01,750
metadata pulled out like I care a lot

00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:03,520
less about the actual content in there

00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:05,320
because like explain it is basically

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,940
what it boils down to because all the

00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,630
things we need to process it or out

00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,630
separately

00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:07,159
[Music]

00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:53,269
[Music]

00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:25,300
yeah and that's actually and the council

00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:27,010
now is a policy for changing the policy

00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:30,270
which is submit a pull request and then

00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:30,270
we vote on it so like you know

00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:52,760
[Music]

00:38:02,020 --> 00:39:10,220
there are yes that's the HTML output

00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:11,540
that's basically gonna be the same thing

00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:14,590
that we have on the wiki now just

00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:17,630
generate and then like I could have the

00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:19,640
scheduled directory sshfs mounted which

00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:21,560
I do anyway and I can just write a file

00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:25,150
out instead of having to like edit the

00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:25,150
section and copy and paste stuff in

00:39:38,649 --> 00:39:42,829
yeah it can be and like once we're

00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:52,479
producing the file we can put it

00:39:42,829 --> 00:39:52,479
wherever like that's other questions

00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:05,539
yeah so it would be nice to basically go

00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:09,259
back to throw a seven and just copy

00:40:05,539 --> 00:40:16,130
everything over no if I get bored or

00:40:09,259 --> 00:40:19,039
something but like yes yeah so what

00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:21,789
what's probably most likely is I'll just

00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:25,249
take the little change set wiki page and

00:40:21,789 --> 00:40:27,439
pipe it to a parser that produces any

00:40:25,249 --> 00:40:30,049
just a regular HTML file and stick that

00:40:27,439 --> 00:40:31,609
in the same location so we'll meet you

00:40:30,049 --> 00:40:35,019
and then maybe also the change pages

00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:35,019
themselves just so that way there is

00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:39,380
some historical record that we don't

00:40:37,459 --> 00:40:42,849
lose but not necessary have to go

00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,849
through and reproduce the wheel

00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,289
as you come across those things if you'd

00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:48,240
like drop a link to me I'd kinda like to

00:41:46,289 --> 00:41:50,130
see how other people reference our stuff

00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,980
goes like that would be helpful in

00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:54,660
knowing how how the information is

00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,279
consumed outside of the community

00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,470
because that's going back to what I was

00:41:56,279 --> 00:42:00,390
saying about communication that's one of

00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:02,039
the new main target audiences is people

00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:04,470
who aren't coming to flock or

00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:07,940
contributing to fedora it's you know the

00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:07,940
tech community

00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:21,269
so you should also when you come across

00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:23,160
these links send them to Matthew so he

00:43:21,269 --> 00:43:25,709
can use them to talk to his management

00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:28,640
like hey look at how much we're driving

00:43:25,709 --> 00:43:28,640
the rest of the ecosystem

00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:49,030
[Music]

00:43:54,469 --> 00:44:02,160
great and I know the number of projects

00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:05,670
that have built their process based on

00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,979
ours like for example the Mandriva

00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:10,229
family changed their whole development

00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:12,329
process to be just like ours after it

00:44:10,229 --> 00:44:16,829
worked out so well for us so there was

00:44:12,329 --> 00:44:18,719
that the early OpenStack stuff for their

00:44:16,829 --> 00:44:21,119
scheduling and release identification

00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:23,630
was very similar to our process before

00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,630
they switched

00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:53,780
would you mind sending that to me when

00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:54,860
you if you remember yeah it's like to

00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:57,260
take a look I like to see what other

00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:59,630
projects do because there aren't too

00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:01,670
many projects of our size that have like

00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:04,960
processes around stuff in this way so

00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:04,960
it's always nice to compare notes

00:45:39,190 --> 00:46:16,790
mural that you give the last one and I'm

00:45:41,990 --> 00:46:20,000
going to get out they will be easier to

00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:22,190
find I hopefully they'll be a little

00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,900
more clear about like because it'll be

00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:26,390
like you know closed implement it but I

00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:28,580
guess that'll that's current state I

00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:31,420
don't know that I don't think it'll help

00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:34,460
I hope it won't make it worse I think

00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:37,270
doing a better job of keeping our

00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:40,580
documentation up-to-date and in this a

00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:42,050
single same place so you know the less

00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:44,150
documentation we have in the wiki I

00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:46,340
think the easier it will be for people

00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:48,230
using search engines to find the correct

00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:50,660
documentation because it'll just point

00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:52,670
to you know doc stop Fedora project org

00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:54,230
instead of a wiki page that somebody

00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:58,030
wrote and never actually implemented

00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:58,030
seven years ago but

00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:13,810
[Music]

00:47:08,849 --> 00:47:16,630
yeah yeah that makes sense all right

00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:18,900
well it's now 47 minutes after I started

00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:22,890
four 25-minute talk

00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:26,030
oops thank you everyone for coming

00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:26,030
