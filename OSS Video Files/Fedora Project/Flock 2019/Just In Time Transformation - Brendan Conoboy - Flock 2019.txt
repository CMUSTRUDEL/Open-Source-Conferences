Description: 
	The formula to success is ever changing so successful stewards plan for the future. In 2015 Red Hat both began and stopped work on the next generation of RHEL. Why was that? RHEL, an Open Source distribution combining the work of thousands of upstream communities, still had its roots in a process and culture that predated Agile software development. To build the next generation of Enterprise Linux it was necessary to change the very core of how it was made while maintaining compatibility and community norms. Join this session to learn how Red Hat changed the design, process, and cultural underpinning of its most successful product and what we learned along the way.
