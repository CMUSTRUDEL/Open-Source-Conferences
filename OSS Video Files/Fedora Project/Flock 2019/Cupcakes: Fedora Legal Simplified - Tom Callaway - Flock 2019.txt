Title: Cupcakes: Fedora Legal Simplified - Tom Callaway - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-08-28
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	A discussion of the current state of legal affairs in Fedora. I'll start with an overview of the current policies and practices that exist because for legal reasons, then discuss our stance on licensing, export compliance, patents, and trademarks. I'll throw in some specific changes that have occurred in the last year, and have a fun discussion on any questions or issues that the Fedora community wants to bring up. Has your bug been sitting in FE-LEGAL forever? Has no one replied to your legal@lists.fedoraproject.org email? Do you want to hear about cupcakes?
