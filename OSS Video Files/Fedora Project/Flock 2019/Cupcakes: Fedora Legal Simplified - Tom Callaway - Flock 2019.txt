Title: Cupcakes: Fedora Legal Simplified - Tom Callaway - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-08-28
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	A discussion of the current state of legal affairs in Fedora. I'll start with an overview of the current policies and practices that exist because for legal reasons, then discuss our stance on licensing, export compliance, patents, and trademarks. I'll throw in some specific changes that have occurred in the last year, and have a fun discussion on any questions or issues that the Fedora community wants to bring up. Has your bug been sitting in FE-LEGAL forever? Has no one replied to your legal@lists.fedoraproject.org email? Do you want to hear about cupcakes?

hi I am Tom Calloway in case you don't

00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:10,340
know me for some reason I am the Fedora

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,780
legal lead the standard disclaimer when

00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,480
giving any sort of legal talk is

00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:17,060
required so I'm not a lawyer I work with

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,310
them but I'm not one nothing in this

00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,140
presentation written or spoken should be

00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,220
considered legal advice which means if

00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,619
you go out and do something stupid

00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:28,580
because Tom told you so not only are you

00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:30,619
stupid but I'm not liable well I worked

00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,480
for Red Hat for a very long time and I

00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:34,070
am allowed occasionally to speak on

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,140
behalf of Red Hat you should not assume

00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,180
that anything I say or present in this

00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:44,000
material reflects red hats opinions

00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:45,890
stances or favorite dinosaurs well so

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,719
that brings me to our next talk which is

00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:51,890
all the legal changes that we've made as

00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:56,660
a result of the IBM acquisition so now

00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:58,399
that we're done with that no I am has

00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,960
not informed me that anything has

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,550
changed in regards to what I'm saying

00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,009
and because Red Hat is acting as an

00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,979
independent entity that's why it is

00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:08,659
still accurate so I want to go over a

00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:11,900
brief overview of the legal policies

00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:13,729
that exist today in fedora so that we

00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,990
can have a baseline so when I'm talking

00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:18,140
about things we understand where we're

00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:19,549
moving from to and what not so the first

00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,950
one is that everything in fedora needs

00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:23,299
to be free software there's one

00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,470
exception to that which is firmware

00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:28,970
that's needed to make free software work

00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,890
content can sometimes be an exception to

00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,990
this there are carefully defined rules

00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,640
about when content is acceptable the

00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,670
rough rule on content is we'd really

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,439
like it to be free but if it's at least

00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:43,040
distributable without restrictions then

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:45,890
it is okay software cannot have a hard

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,810
dependency on non-free software a hard

00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:51,649
dependency in our p.m. syntax is a

00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:53,659
requires so if you link against

00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:55,820
something that is non-free when you

00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:57,979
build and you hopefully wanted to shove

00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,799
that in the fedora then no that's not

00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:02,780
okay it also needs to be safer right had

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,740
to distribute this is a little broader

00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,740
and yeah go ahead I'm sorry

00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:12,340
I don't have an answer for that one yet

00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:14,230
there's been a lot of discussion about

00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,750
whether we could have things in fedora

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:19,720
that have suggested enhances that point

00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:22,200
to non-free things that may exist in

00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,910
other repositories that we're aware of

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,310
if you had some sort of a plug-in model

00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:29,350
where if it detected ffmpeg it would

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,000
deal open it and off you went and had

00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:34,150
that functionality automatically but it

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,830
was not linked against it that would be

00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,600
obviously something will be nice to

00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,420
include the question is whether we

00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,519
inherit any risk from explicitly calling

00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,459
that out as if we're aware that these

00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:47,050
things exist in a broader context so

00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:48,580
that's a deeper discussion that has to

00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,980
be had with the lawyers about mitigating

00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,690
risk in those cases I think there's a

00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,030
reasonable argument to be made that it

00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:58,300
should be possible for us to do this but

00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:03,940
I haven't cleared it yet so we'll talk

00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:05,440
about that at flock 2023 yeah

00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,110
the lawyers love every time I come to

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,519
them with these existential questions

00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,320
they say things like what's the business

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,750
justification for that and why would

00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,910
anyone ever want to do that ah but

00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,049
anyways so it needs to be safe for

00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,000
Redhead distribute is a little vague

00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:22,180
it's important to remember that Red Hat

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,709
is a us-based company we are still a

00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,079
us-based company even after the

00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:29,709
acquisition so we have to be compliant

00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:33,630
with US laws we cannot infringe known US

00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:35,410
patents that is worded very carefully

00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,420
everyone knows we should never ever

00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:39,310
infringe patents but things we don't

00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:44,680
know about are less damaging than things

00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:48,579
we do and there's also cases where for

00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,350
things like DMCA which is the law in the

00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:52,209
United States that has specific

00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,760
restrictions on what software can and

00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:56,350
cannot do we need to honor that as well

00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,620
and that's a little bit difficult that's

00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:01,150
that usually involves me looking at

00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,700
something and saying that very clearly

00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,049
violates the DMCA or I'm not sure so we

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,040
probably will let it go until someone

00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:10,840
tells us by a court case that it does

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,670
there's a very small list of things that

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,050
meet that criteria currently so for most

00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,659
packages it's not something that people

00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:18,500
need to worry about also respecting

00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:19,700
trademarks

00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,980
affecting trademarks is not something

00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,600
that we are legally obligated to do

00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,720
however it is something that we have as

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:30,050
a policy of fedora as a good citizen to

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,720
the ecosystems so we don't carry things

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:35,930
like I believe there is a game called

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,240
Super Mario with a y that someone has

00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:41,990
made which is a clear mario clone and

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,210
does not honor the trademarks and there

00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,950
is no reason legally we could not

00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,180
distribute it other than that Nintendo

00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:50,840
would immediately give us a cease and

00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:53,150
desist if we ever did anyway so those

00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,740
are the legal policies that we have at

00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,870
that level we also have export

00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,640
restrictions because of US export laws

00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,740
we cannot export for there were two

00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,800
sanctioned countries or individuals the

00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:06,770
list of individuals is long and

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,840
difficult to parse so but for the most

00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,760
part the terrorists warlords that are on

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,620
this list do not have any real interest

00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,230
in contributing to fedora as of date

00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,480
that we know of and if so they're not

00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:23,120
using their real names anyway so we're

00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:26,169
not sure about that yes also and they

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,479
never ever go through VPNs or proxies so

00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:32,360
we can't send fedora to Cuba Iran North

00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:35,240
Korea Sudan Syria or Crimea specifically

00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,979
is the Crimea region of Ukraine which is

00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,840
confusing if you believe Russia stance

00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:41,600
on the universe but anyways that's the

00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,669
u.s. stance on things so we also cannot

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,400
have fedora contributors in these

00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:49,010
countries now that phrasing is very

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,650
specific it's not nationality it is

00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:53,240
contributors in these countries which

00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:56,930
begs the question how we know where they

00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:03,440
are or why that matters but it does mean

00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:05,150
that we can't have flaw Cuba so we means

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,830
not just Red Hat but it also means every

00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:10,220
Fedora community member and anyone who

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:12,200
downloads fedora as well and we know

00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,760
this sucks because there are good people

00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,100
in these countries who wish to make

00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,919
meaningful contributions to fedora and

00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:22,630
broader open source and there is nothing

00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:22,630
that we can actually do about it

00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:27,530
as far as licenses are concerned we do

00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:28,610
have this lovely URL with this license

00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,919
list we have

00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,650
more than 350 free licenses tracked and

00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:35,960
labeled I'm proud to say that in 2019 to

00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,759
date we have only added two new licenses

00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,530
to the good list which is which is the

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,240
least we've done ever

00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:44,030
which makes me all warm and fuzzy inside

00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,400
part of this we also added one bad

00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,259
license but I don't generally add bad

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,939
licenses because multiple licenses I see

00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:52,009
that are bad I don't ever want anyone to

00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:54,199
ever see them again and so I don't add

00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:58,270
them unless they are commonly come

00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:58,270
across or they're making a lot of noise

00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:07,580
yeah that's the spiel but it's also

00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:09,830
worth noting that there are still 16 BSD

00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,990
variants and 34 MIT variants that we are

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:23,569
tracking in fedora we call all of these

00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:25,250
BSD and MIT the server side public

00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:35,690
license I believe is the full name of

00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:37,759
that license PDS SP DX categorizes some

00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:40,729
of these as separate licenses they don't

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:43,009
have all of our variants in SPD X

00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:44,419
because they copied our list and our

00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:50,419
list is incomplete because I stopped

00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:54,949
naming them after a while well I may but

00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:56,089
I didn't want at that point in time and

00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:57,740
so the two of you know licenses that you

00:07:56,089 --> 00:08:01,009
did get added were the BSD plus patents

00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:03,800
license that was written I believe by a

00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:05,689
lawyer at Intel and then the I'm not

00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,860
gonna even pretend to pronounce that

00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:08,839
second one I'm gonna let someone who

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,669
speaks there you go thank you

00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:12,439
speaks French as their native language

00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:14,300
that is a Content license that was

00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:17,389
created recently that something was

00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:20,870
shipping a large quantity of stuff it

00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:22,969
it's free and then we just get my

00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,860
duplicate slide here contributing to

00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:27,259
fedora we used to have a CLA once upon a

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,000
time in the long long ago I was a pile

00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:30,080
of confusing legalese that lots of

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,699
corporate entities were unwilling to

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,349
agree to lots of individuals were

00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:34,849
unwilling to agree to it it looked like

00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:36,409
a copyright assignment although that was

00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:38,449
never the intent

00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:39,919
although determining the intent of

00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:42,769
something that was written for lawyer

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,300
teams ago is always fun we moved to the

00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:46,069
Fedora project contributor agreement

00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,750
which were simplified terms with the

00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:49,699
goal of being able to assign a default

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,529
free license to contributions if the

00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:58,160
owner doesn't specify or attach a

00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:59,629
license to that contribution yes again

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,129
it doesn't mean that they has to be a

00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:02,810
foster license and it says in there if

00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:04,069
you put a license on there that we don't

00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,990
want to use we just won't use your

00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:07,550
contribution so if you contribute

00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,689
something under a non free license we go

00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,589
thank you for your contribution we're

00:09:08,689 --> 00:09:14,199
not using it and we drop it on the floor

00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:17,810
no not to my knowledge

00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:20,209
please don't go out and legal corner

00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:22,819
cases I appreciate it your your joy

00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:27,110
comes from the small things in life but

00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:28,730
mine no longer does so these are all of

00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:32,810
our basic legal policies that we have

00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:34,730
for fedora simplified out now everything

00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,589
we do in fedora in this space is very

00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:40,279
community powered despite the fact that

00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:41,720
I am the Fedora legal team by involving

00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,040
our community with these legal policies

00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,899
and concerns we are able to identify

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,000
potential risks earlier and on a

00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:49,459
distributed scale and this benefits both

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,800
up streams and down streams of fedora if

00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:55,459
we are trusted to be doing a reasonably

00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:57,410
good job at policing ourselves then

00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:59,810
other people are more comfortable using

00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,730
us as a base and up streams are more

00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,290
comfortable taking the changes back that

00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,959
they see us making because we are making

00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:08,779
them across the board if we were to

00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:10,790
exempt for example just say we only care

00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:12,139
about enforcing GPL and nothing else in

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:14,209
our distribution gets that level of

00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:16,639
attention then everyone else would not

00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:19,459
be as trustworthy about what we're doing

00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:21,110
in the work that we have happened but we

00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:22,880
also want to make sure that I'm not the

00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:25,220
only person who has to do all legal

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,019
reviews on every single package right

00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,550
now I'm only examining cases where the

00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:30,380
community doesn't feel confident that

00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,970
this is obviously the right thing if

00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,949
something comes through that is marked

00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,629
as GPL and includes a copy of copying

00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:37,069
and there's nothing suspicious in it the

00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:38,959
community should feel comfortable saying

00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:40,850
that's GPL and moving on with their

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,240
lives without blocking me to go into a

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:45,500
manual file-by-file audit on that

00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,540
package and for the most part this is

00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,050
how things work today the community says

00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,089
I think this is okay let

00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:54,029
move on we don't have to even tell me

00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:56,880
about it versus I think this is probably

00:10:54,029 --> 00:11:00,149
not okay or I'm not sure I need someone

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,580
to check and so there's a couple ways

00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:04,320
you can report legal issues one of them

00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:07,110
is to file a bug which is blocked

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,120
against the FE legal tracker the second

00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,279
is you can email the legal mailing list

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,779
which is public and archived and the

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,970
third is that you can email legal at

00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:16,320
Fedora project org which is private

00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,880
I guess the fourth would technically be

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,860
if you wanted to encrypt that for some

00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:23,279
reason you could send it directly to me

00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:26,420
my GPG key is all over the internet for

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,800
about 20 years now

00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:32,279
now one fun little thing to talk about

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:34,470
is coppers they have the same licensing

00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:37,620
and legal policies as fedora packages

00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:39,450
now we do have relatively good community

00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,730
oversight on coppers but this is done by

00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,980
a very small number of people I think

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:46,500
there are maybe three people who have

00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,510
ever filed a light have ever flagged

00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:53,130
something as questionably illegal in

00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:54,630
copers not counting me and so it would

00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:57,180
be really nice if we had more people

00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:59,279
helping to look at obvious things that

00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,260
are not okay we are regularly seeing

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,170
coppers created with a half MPEG inside

00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:06,540
of it we are regularly seeing coppers

00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:10,649
created with obviously non free items

00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:12,930
the nvidia driver open CL all sorts of

00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:14,880
other things where sometimes there are

00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,410
packages available from the vendor that

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,910
they get shoved into a cobra because i

00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:20,820
want to make it easy to install them all

00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:22,470
at once usually we see these where it's

00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,529
like somebody names the copper after

00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:27,930
themselves or the favorite name of my

00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:30,000
packages and all of those things are

00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:32,250
sitting together and I have to go

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,540
through and delete that entire repo at

00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,339
once and then send them a nice email

00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:38,399
that says do to all the things you did

00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:39,620
not read I have to take your cope around

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,940
I'm very very sorry

00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,680
there's probably significant room for

00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,390
tooling improvement here in the Cobra

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,000
infrastructure because most offenders

00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:49,800
that I email if they reply at all they

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,649
reply and say I had no idea I wasn't

00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,570
allowed to do this and it's true that

00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:56,310
the place where our licensing policies

00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:58,800
is in the Cobra Docs

00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:00,720
buried inside of it in one paragraph in

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,760
a non-standard section as opposed to

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,290
something where

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,120
when you access coppers for the first

00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:06,860
time some sort of pop-up that says hey

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,470
by the way or even when you instantiate

00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,940
a new koper reminding you that you

00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,170
shouldn't put any you shouldn't put

00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,060
anything so it doesn't it to be a like a

00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:16,699
significant overhaul but just something

00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,380
that minimizes the risk of I had no idea

00:13:16,699 --> 00:13:20,990
I could do that and having that be a

00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,769
legitimate argument I realized that it's

00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,269
not stopping me

00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:25,940
I didn't read this because it wasn't in

00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:28,250
a language I normally parse but anything

00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,190
we can do to help people understand why

00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,060
their copra might be at risk is helpful

00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,760
sometimes people get really agitated

00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,529
when they've shoved 400 source rpms into

00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,750
one copper and I go and delete that

00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:40,459
because one of them is non-free because

00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,199
right now I have no way of just taking

00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:44,570
out the ffmpeg builds from their

00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:46,100
environment nor should I really be able

00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,660
to because a lot of times they end up

00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,610
being linked I'm dependencies against

00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,529
other stuff in there and there's no sane

00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,459
way for me to say this and this and this

00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:53,480
and this and this and this and this and

00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:57,500
this even though they're fine because

00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,029
they were built against that alright so

00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,860
let's talk about a specific case which

00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:02,570
is ECC this comes up from time to time

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:06,649
ECC stands for elliptic curve

00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:10,880
cryptography I've created a new wiki

00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:13,250
page on here legal ECC this lists all of

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,290
the curves that are permitted in fedora

00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,970
this is something that was people who

00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,310
sort of had an idea about what this was

00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,110
in a vague sense but we're now at a

00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:24,050
point where there's no reason not to

00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:26,930
document what this is so this this page

00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:28,670
exists most but not all ECC curves are

00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,089
permitted and enabled in fedora at this

00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,790
point

00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:34,819
clearing additional curves is difficult

00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:37,730
and time consuming the last time I had

00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:39,019
to do one it took nine months and that

00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,459
was because I knew at the beginning of

00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:41,510
the process that I had a good chance of

00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:43,100
being able to clear it

00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:45,500
most of the curves that haven't been

00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,910
cleared I know they won't and that's why

00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,329
I haven't gone down a nine month process

00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:51,500
to determine that they won't so you're

00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:53,600
just gonna have to take my word for it

00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,800
if you decide you want to be a pretend

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,209
patent attorney and do the research

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,769
yourself I'm coming to bring me nine

00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:59,569
months worth of research I will happily

00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:01,279
consider that and then start the same

00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:03,290
nine month process over inside Red Hat

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,920
but if you can convince me first I'm

00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:08,720
willing to do the additional steps that

00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,370
said I do not recommend any of you ever

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,930
look at patents because that makes you

00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,710
patent tainted and then it makes it very

00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:15,740
difficult for you

00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,910
do unique software development that is

00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,170
not advice that is just my

00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:29,570
recommendation you do what you do

00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:30,770
questions on this no because it means

00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,150
what I'm aware that those curves may

00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,890
exist and if they happen to slip into

00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:38,930
fedora it makes mr. Polly liable for

00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:40,960
patent infringement so no I can't do

00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,960
that

00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:53,410
so other curves may exist but I'm not

00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:56,540
listing them yes what

00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:59,680
probably yeah it's not written down

00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,680
though so I never said it

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,740
audio so the noteworthy things in audio

00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,550
I'm not talking about mp3 anymore

00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,320
because if you haven't figured out

00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:13,490
that's patent cleared then welcome to

00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:16,490
the land of tomorrow AAC the licensing

00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:18,080
on AAC is not ideal we did a lot of work

00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:20,030
with the specific license around that

00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,740
package and determined that in that very

00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:24,460
specific scenario in which we are using

00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:27,200
that license it is indeed GPL compatible

00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:29,750
basically there's a patent section in

00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,760
the license that if it was in play would

00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,110
make it GPL incompatible but because we

00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,900
happen to have a high degree of

00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:39,650
confidence that that situation is not in

00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:41,630
play we can treat it as a no op and thus

00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:43,130
are acting in the case where it is GPL

00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:45,710
compatible you should never use this

00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:48,200
license for anything else ever please

00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:50,810
and in fact if someone happened to write

00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,280
a proper AC implementation that met that

00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,530
specific provision of the spec that

00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,850
we're carrying it would make a lot of

00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,380
people very very happy that we wouldn't

00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:59,150
have to use that license we asked the

00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,130
upstream if they would consider not

00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,510
using that license or amending that

00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:06,470
license because they have effectively

00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:13,790
abandoned that codebase and their answer

00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:15,650
after almost a year was no but the good

00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,540
news is is that AAC as implemented in

00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:19,370
fedora today is more feature-rich than

00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,900
initially implemented because we argued

00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:26,640
about it so long that several more

00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:28,230
patents expired G seven to nine audio

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,780
is something that I keep meaning to

00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:32,190
enable and forgetting it's been ready

00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,070
for us to include without legal

00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:37,560
boundaries since 2017 but no one's

00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:39,510
mentioned it to me since 2017 so it

00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,610
hasn't gotten done so if anybody wants

00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:43,620
to go and implement she's 7 to 9 audio

00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,000
codecs in Fedor you can go right ahead

00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,820
you don't have to clear that through me

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,260
it's all fine otherwise I'll get to it

00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:52,770
when I get to it which will be sometime

00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:55,560
before the Sun explodes video we can now

00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:57,630
ship mpeg-1 and mpeg-2 video completely

00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,640
this took a lot longer than it should

00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:02,090
have due to internal review but it is

00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,510
now done and it is now all on the clear

00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:06,300
fun fact

00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:09,750
mpeg-2 is the document standard for DB

00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:16,070
for DVD video which made things really

00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:21,570
complicated h.264 um we ship or

00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:23,790
technically cisco ships open h.264 as a

00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:27,140
library and a plug-in for various things

00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:29,880
which enables us to have an open source

00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:32,520
h.264 implementation we're not going to

00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,710
be able to get a native h.264

00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:37,530
implementation for a very long time so I

00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:41,070
strongly recommend that you love this

00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:42,480
thing if you can so some stuff that's

00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,970
forbidden for now it's worth talking

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:49,860
about because he keeps coming up

00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:53,550
exFAT is still forbidden until 2024 so

00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:55,170
so flock 2024 will be an exciting one we

00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:59,400
will finally be able to support the most

00:18:55,170 --> 00:19:02,640
common inner common standard for large

00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,260
file interconnectivity what most USB

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,270
sticks are starting to move too and

00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:13,080
things like camera SD cards want to

00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:15,020
start to use yeah our good friends at

00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,040
Microsoft who love open source

00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,980
apparently don't love it enough to

00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,120
permit a patent grant on exFAT they

00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,590
really like the royalties they're

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,690
getting from that and their concern

00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,460
rightfully so from their perspective is

00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:28,920
that if they did grant that then every

00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,120
single implementer of the exFAT standard

00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,590
would simply use the open-source

00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,070
implementation and stopped paying them

00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,070
patent royalties

00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:39,960
so it sucks but they they department at

00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:45,000
Microsoft that collects patent revenue

00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:47,010
hates open source yep

00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,710
DVD playback again we still can't do

00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:51,420
this because of the DMCA in the US this

00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:54,210
will probably be forbidden long enough

00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,630
long after the last DVD media has rotted

00:19:54,210 --> 00:20:01,740
away

00:19:54,630 --> 00:20:05,610
so that is correct however almost no one

00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:08,040
legitimately sells unencrypted DVD media

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:10,230
there are some but it's very few so if

00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,500
you are watching Richard Stallman sing

00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:15,600
the free software song on a DVD then you

00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,880
have deeper problems but that I believe

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:31,800
that media is sold unencrypted too

00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:43,500
specifically and so that that playback

00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:45,420
is supported in for the world today so

00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,950
we have a list of forbidden items this

00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:48,690
is not maintained by me this is

00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,520
maintained by the community and I from

00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,720
time to time go through and correct it

00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,940
when someone adds something that's in

00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,670
inappropriate or incorrect there's no

00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:58,380
real changes to that list for a while it

00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,520
includes some lovely entries which date

00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,410
back to the beginning of fedora

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,750
including discussing why we cannot ship

00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:05,610
a real player so if you're looking for a

00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,680
blast from the past you can go through

00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:08,910
and read that if there's something that

00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,800
you think should be in there go ahead

00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:12,690
and add it I get notified every time

00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,280
somebody touches that wiki page and I go

00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,990
through and correct it so if you want to

00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,450
add something that you think is obvious

00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:23,370
then go ahead and so now we get to

00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:25,350
cupcakes so this is one of the few

00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,610
pictures in this slide deck so these are

00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:30,180
the only cupcakes that will appear in

00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:31,200
this presentation unfortunately so one

00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,610
of the things that has been a byproduct

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,200
of all the work that I've done for

00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:35,550
fedora is that I've been happy to work

00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,310
with up streams and down streams to

00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:39,960
assist them in a non-lawyer capacity to

00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:42,110
attempt to understand and address the

00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,940
legal concerns they may be dealing with

00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:46,680
in theory there are organizations that

00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,250
have lawyers that should be providing

00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:51,120
this as a

00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:52,860
mmunity service two entities but for a

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,930
variety of reasons which are not worth

00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,820
discussing on video or in presentation

00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:59,490
text they are not serving that purpose

00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:02,250
effectively so it falls on to

00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:05,010
well-meaning and well-intentioned and

00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:09,480
generally correct volunteers to fill the

00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:12,060
gap so if you people watching this video

00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,980
or people in this room need to

00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,840
understand something or you see a

00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,060
problem that I could help with upstream

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,980
or downstream please feel free to reach

00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,540
out to me and I will do my best to help

00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,120
out and as much as I can

00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:26,280
obviously if I say this is not okay you

00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,900
shouldn't ship this an upstream says Fu

00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:31,230
I'm doing it anyways then there's that

00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:33,480
gap where we're not gonna agree but most

00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:35,340
of the cases are things like we had no

00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,870
idea this was inappropriate how do we

00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,590
fix this and working with them to

00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:42,150
identify the fix example being I noticed

00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:44,040
while auditing something completely

00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:46,770
unrelated to my normal legal work that

00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,880
there was a section of cute that was

00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:50,100
shipping under a license where the

00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,660
license required that you include a copy

00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,370
of the license in the work when you

00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,810
distributed it and the best of my

00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:58,110
knowledge cute has been violating this

00:22:54,810 --> 00:23:01,170
since 2004 I opened a bud which they a

00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:03,540
year ago which they closed on Tuesday so

00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:05,160
they've now come into compliance and it

00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:07,230
got a it's a small thing but the small

00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:11,100
things eventually add up when people

00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:12,840
copy code and it moves around so you may

00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,640
have noticed that there has been some

00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,950
legal drama going on in the broader

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,930
open-source community now there is a

00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:20,130
thread with pictures here but I'm going

00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,800
to talk through this because I thought

00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:24,000
it was useful to sort of take this

00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:27,450
request that came in from someone who

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,300
will not be named to try and make sense

00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:33,350
of all of this so I sort of did this in

00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:35,850
and explained like I'm five sort of way

00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:37,320
tutor go talk this through and then I'm

00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,040
gonna talk about why it's relevant for

00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,940
Fedora

00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:44,040
that I'm talking about this here so this

00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,750
is all analogies so if these analogies

00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,190
don't make sense just bear with it I

00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:49,500
will explain it at the end I realize

00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:51,060
this is very English centric and

00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,250
sometimes these things may not apply in

00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,930
other languages but if basically a

00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,520
company started making cupcakes and was

00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,540
giving away the recipe lots of other

00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,330
people ate them and thought they were

00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:01,370
tasty so they made more cupcakes

00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:03,140
gave them away for free now the company

00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,430
who made the cupcakes first didn't like

00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,050
that they weren't making any money from

00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:07,550
the other people who were making those

00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:10,130
cupcakes and giving them away for free

00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:11,660
so they paid a lawyer to try to stop it

00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,980
because that is clearly the best way to

00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,350
deal with your community is to pay a

00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,670
lawyer to try to stop something now

00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:18,110
giving where the recipe for the cupcakes

00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:19,550
made it easy for other people to make

00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,710
the cupcakes and the company couldn't

00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:23,540
pay all of those people so the lawyer

00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,130
tried to be sneaky and clever and this

00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,690
is usually a bad idea when the lawyers

00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,880
try to be sneaky and clever even if

00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:30,560
they're well-intentioned I mean a new

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,120
rule that said that you could keep

00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,770
giving away their cupcakes but you also

00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,630
had to give away everything that you use

00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:36,890
to make the cupcakes including the

00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,180
kitchen utensils the kitchen in the

00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:43,760
house and anyone who ever looked at the

00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:45,110
house but in reality they just wanted to

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,760
scare people so that they would come and

00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,560
pay the money to be able to ignore that

00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,050
rule need cupcakes and have this as a

00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,520
revenue stream

00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:54,080
they took this new cupcake license to

00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,030
the people who determine if a license is

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,460
okay or not we'll call these people the

00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:59,840
Justice League the Justice League has a

00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,030
book that tells them if a cupcake

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,350
license is okay or not okay and then

00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:05,810
look at the book very closely to

00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:07,310
determine this their book is old and was

00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:10,460
written before cupcakes could be eaten

00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:11,630
on cloudy days or in containers now the

00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,250
lawyer who did this thought they were

00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:14,900
very clever and had made the cupcake

00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,880
license do everything the book said it

00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,560
must but it was clear to everybody

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,110
reading the cupcake license in the book

00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,180
that it violated the spirit of what was

00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,740
intended with the book so at this point

00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:26,000
everybody started to take sides in this

00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,650
community some people thought that a

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,300
very strict reading of the book was all

00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,740
that mattered other people felt that the

00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,930
intent of the book applied to modern

00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,250
times and needed to be considered and so

00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:35,570
other people just basically started

00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,770
complaining that the Justice League was

00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:38,630
being too secretive and how they were

00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:40,820
deciding these things or generally too

00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:42,800
slow and then some of the Justice League

00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,390
members are just plain old jerks and it

00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,710
makes it really hard for anybody to try

00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,090
and deal with the process because

00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,860
somebody just keeps opening their mouths

00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:51,350
and yelling jerky noises and everyone

00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:52,730
hates it now some people think that the

00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:54,140
book should be changed but no one is

00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:55,820
able to agree on how it should be

00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:57,950
changed or even what the process to

00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:01,100
change it should be and it hasn't been

00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:02,570
changed in a long time as a result so in

00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,070
the middle of all of this another clever

00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:05,870
lawyer comes along with a new cupcake

00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:07,820
license and this lawyer is trying very

00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:10,610
hard to create a cupcake license that

00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:12,490
extends protections to modern situations

00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,740
but still honoring the letter and

00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:16,720
the spirit of the book now they say that

00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:19,030
eating a cupcake in a cloud is the same

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,500
as a public performance which is an

00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,490
obscure protection in the field of

00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,190
cupcake rules

00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:26,230
aka copyright no one has ever tried to

00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:29,679
apply this concept to cupcakes or any

00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:31,000
baked goods or anything before and this

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,990
is super controversial because some

00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,520
people feel like this is stretching

00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,809
things too far to fit the book and

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:38,500
should not be done it's like saying

00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:40,809
that's not a shoe it's a banana some

00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,190
people argue that cupcake licenses are

00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:43,660
not the place to make these sorts of new

00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:45,550
changes and we should wait for the law

00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:47,679
to catch up in the law define what a

00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:49,300
public performance of software is or

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,830
that may be the Justice League is not

00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,120
the right place to consider them again

00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:55,059
remembering that the Justice League is

00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:56,260
sometimes composed of jerks still other

00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:57,940
people feel that this change is

00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,830
unnecessary and the existing cupcake

00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,710
licenses in the book are just fine as

00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:04,990
they are but ultimately it all boils

00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:07,330
down to this one simple thing change is

00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:09,670
scary and it's really really scary for

00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:11,590
lawyers because change means uncertainty

00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,780
and risk and a hundred percent of a

00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:16,300
lawyers do day in day out is mitigate

00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:17,559
uncertainty and risk and so they really

00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:20,620
don't like it when you come to them and

00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:22,450
say hey everything has changed so this

00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:24,010
is not helped in any way in our open

00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,870
source communities by the lack of any

00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:28,530
sort of method of changing the book to

00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:32,890
reflect the modern realities of our

00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:35,530
universe so because cloud computing is

00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:37,980
not going away and we probably need new

00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:41,620
licenses that better apply the spirit of

00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:44,260
Foss to it it's not easy to do this it's

00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:46,870
really really tricky people have very

00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:48,040
strong opinions about this lawyers enjoy

00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,630
nothing more than arguing with each

00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,790
other in their language that only they

00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:54,309
speak and the majority of the fine

00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:55,390
points are super complicated you find a

00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:57,100
lot of people you look at the one

00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:58,980
example of a license in this space that

00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:03,090
is widely used or at least widely

00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:05,590
accepted to be ok which is the a GPL and

00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:07,210
yeah and people make that face so half

00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:08,200
the people are like this is perfect and

00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:09,970
brilliant and solves all the problems

00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,230
and the rest of the people are like why

00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,610
in the world do I have to jump through

00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:15,910
all these flaming hoops just to make

00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:17,530
everybody happy so why do we care in

00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:19,690
fedora about all of this exploding

00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:21,100
around us one of these things is that

00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:23,180
there are a lot of companies that are

00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:25,910
using licensing in place of a valid

00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:28,220
this model and this is resulting in an

00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,660
increase of generation new licenses so

00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,070
there's a lot of people even who are

00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:34,280
companies who are trying to write new

00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:36,650
licenses as a result of all of this

00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,970
noise and that means that in theory a

00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,740
lot of things that might be coming into

00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:41,390
Fedora in the near future may be coming

00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,850
in with these new weird or just

00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:45,560
unacceptable licenses and it's helpful

00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,700
for us to be aware that this is

00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,610
happening and to understand the

00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:51,230
motivations behind these licenses

00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:53,410
because Fedora is a flag carrier for

00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:55,730
best practices in Foss in a lot of ways

00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:58,910
this is one of the reasons why we spoke

00:28:55,730 --> 00:29:01,060
out as a community against the SPL which

00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:03,740
was the license that MongoDB wrote

00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:07,130
specifically in my analogies about

00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:10,310
cupcakes to try to prevent people from

00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:11,810
being able to reasonably honoring it

00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:14,000
they said this is open-source because if

00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:15,530
you do all of these awful and obscure

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,910
and difficult and complicated things

00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,930
then you're still in compliance and

00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:21,380
everything is fine and what's the

00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:22,790
problem with that and in practice they

00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,710
made it impossible for anyone to

00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:26,300
reasonably comply with the license but

00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:28,010
that's okay because they you can just

00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,650
pay them and all those pains go away and

00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:31,910
you can get a different license we

00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:34,820
thought that was obviously a really bad

00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:36,380
idea it's nice and helpful for the Foss

00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:38,450
communities to be able to have a very

00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,730
clear understanding of what is open and

00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,800
what isn't and helping everyone to

00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:45,530
understand that we stand up and say this

00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:48,710
is not free this is not open this is not

00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:50,360
open source also fedora is innovating on

00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:52,340
the cutting edge of cloud and containers

00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,650
and if we're going to be in these spaces

00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,940
then we need to be aware of the legal

00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:57,860
issues that are happening in those

00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,720
spaces so that we can participate

00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:05,330
meaningfully in them when the time is

00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:07,130
right and that's pretty much it you know

00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:09,020
this is that this is just the overview

00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:11,600
of where we are in legal land without

00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:13,280
going super deep into any one topic now

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,600
normally I leave lots of time here at

00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:18,620
the end because people want to go super

00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:20,270
deep into one topic but I have some

00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,980
bonus topics if you want to bring up

00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:23,540
specific topics I know these things

00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,340
likely come up so I went ahead made a

00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,870
slide with them but if you don't want to

00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,610
ask a question about one of these things

00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:32,260
that is also fun we can talk about

00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:32,260
whatever is interesting to talk about

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,400
so the question summarized is how how is

00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,410
it how do I determine the effective

00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,090
license of a work when I'm doing this

00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:42,210
sort of thing so that other people can

00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:44,430
attempt to copy that methodology it

00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:47,250
really is sort of a case-by-case basis

00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:50,340
understanding how things in ER depend

00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:53,220
upon each other obviously things are

00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:56,520
going to be different in a in a linked

00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:59,820
environment versus a interpreted

00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:02,700
environment so that's the first cases so

00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:04,980
I try to understand is this code that

00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,450
I'm looking at the license for how does

00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:10,110
it interoperate with the rest of the

00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:11,910
code inside of the immediate boundary

00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:13,830
that I've defined usually I'm working on

00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:16,350
the boundary of a specific package so

00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:18,540
it's is taking this package looking at

00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:20,190
its source code in isolation not looking

00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,690
at it in a broader context not saying

00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:23,460
well how does this interact with G Lib C

00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:25,710
because I know it links against that but

00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:29,580
looking at it inside that box of itself

00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:30,600
only and then helping to understand the

00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,210
first thing you want to do when you're

00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,890
doing that sort of review is making sure

00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,720
that you have a good understanding of

00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:38,460
what the license is on all of the files

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,990
that are contained within it with the

00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,760
exception of files that do not matter

00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:44,610
things that do not matter are things

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:47,730
like make files build files unless they

00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:51,690
are doing something incredibly

00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:53,190
unique and innovative and that happens

00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:57,870
so rarely that you can safely assume

00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:59,400
they are not Auto tools maybe giant and

00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:04,020
painful to look at but nothing in there

00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:06,540
is innovative make files also the same

00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:08,310
thing now if you run make and it starts

00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:13,560
playing Tetris then maybe we should have

00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:15,600
a conversation well yes but

00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:18,810
and then you once you've gotten that

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,700
understanding some things I do is there

00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:22,800
are some open tools that are out there

00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,150
that do some basic license scraping if

00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,340
you're not comfortable using one of

00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:29,220
those tools that are out there using

00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:31,920
grep is a really good way to start grep

00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:33,900
space - ir space copyright is a really

00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,840
good way to start looking for licenses

00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:39,390
in the source space but also looking at

00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,570
the read means usually not always but

00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:44,850
usually the read Me's are correct with

00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:47,430
regards to licensing they may be missing

00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:49,110
things but if it says all the files in

00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:52,020
this work are under this license and I

00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:54,480
come across files that aren't licensed

00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:56,190
but clearly were generated by the same

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,870
author or same community then you can

00:33:56,190 --> 00:34:00,120
safely assume they're under that license

00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:02,040
even though they may not be that is the

00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,720
way that almost everyone operates on

00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,210
these things it would be great if every

00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:09,420
file was always accompanied by it's a

00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:11,370
signed license but and again if there's

00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:13,740
evidence to the contrary like if I look

00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:17,190
at a file and it was very clearly copied

00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:19,170
from dec VMs then I don't believe that

00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:20,610
it's likely to be under the same license

00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:23,070
because the copyright holder is not the

00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:24,510
same if the styling of the file is

00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:26,310
completely different from the rest of

00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:28,350
the works inside the package like if

00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:30,900
it's the one Perl file in the giant

00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:32,880
package of ball python then it probably

00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:34,620
wasn't written by the same people and is

00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,840
not necessarily under the same license

00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:39,270
sometimes what I'll do in those cases is

00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:41,310
I will actually put chunks of that code

00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:43,500
which appear to be unique and original

00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:45,690
and search them either through Google or

00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,340
github or both and see if I can find

00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:49,170
other examples of this to determine

00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:51,060
where it came from

00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,860
sometimes I will look in the revision

00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,630
control history for those sorts of files

00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:56,070
where I can't determine who did it and

00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:58,440
look at the commits and figure out how

00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:59,600
it ended up in there if we can do that

00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,740
then we can trace hierarchy

00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:04,270
we can usually figure out what the

00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,270
license is supposed to be on those works

00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:30,050
sure you know I maintain that so he's

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:31,610
allowed to go there so well so it's the

00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:32,900
person who did the tech live audit in

00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:34,790
order to make sure that it would come

00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:37,040
properly into fedora it was a lengthy

00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:39,410
process that took extremely long time to

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:44,060
track down all the licenses tacked live

00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:46,160
does a on a on a score from one where

00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:47,600
you don't do any legal work whatsoever

00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,020
and ten where you do everything

00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:53,990
perfectly they come in at around a seven

00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:55,760
as after the audit and me giving them a

00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:57,200
laundry list of all the things that were

00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,230
wrong with their distribution and their

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,940
licensing model they fixed most of them

00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:04,070
they do continue to add non-free items

00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:05,650
to their release and then refer to their

00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:08,450
releases completely free and open source

00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:10,040
which is annoying but I haven't I

00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:12,230
haven't figured out how to solve that

00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,240
problem yet because me screaming at them

00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:16,220
doesn't seem to solve it and they have

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:20,810
no bug tracker so there's no way for me

00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:23,360
to file bugs against their stuff sort of

00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:25,370
it sort of does but it's a mailing list

00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,020
and it's not really a bug tracker and

00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:28,970
they don't answer things I send in the

00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,740
mailing list anymore when their mailing

00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:33,810
list is working which is rare

00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,810
[Music]

00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:49,810
it used to I gutted that it was

00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:54,760
massively broken yes it well tech life

00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:57,280
contains more than 10,000 individual

00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,600
components all of which are individually

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,360
licensed they effectively would be

00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:08,980
unique packages in a different universe

00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:13,150
but we don't do that and yes that is

00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:15,490
correct and tech tells people just

00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:17,200
install the vendor collection package

00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:19,270
which is a rule which is a meta package

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,450
basically which pulls it in everything

00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:25,900
else so and then because that's how they

00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:27,550
recommend people install tech we kind of

00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,840
have to package everything to meet all

00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:33,370
the meta packages that could possibly

00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:36,700
exist and so a lot of these packages are

00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:37,900
extremely old and haven't been updated

00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:40,270
in forever but they are still

00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,560
dependencies in the tech universe and so

00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:43,930
it was important to understand the

00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:46,360
licensing on all of those components so

00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:48,220
that if we have any particular branch of

00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:50,680
dependencies where something is rotten

00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:52,810
at the core at the specific point that

00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,920
we are also able did not have broken

00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:58,000
dependencies down the line tech has

00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,580
extensive dependencies but there's no

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,580
way to auto-generate them and so I

00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:05,050
either have to look at the metadata file

00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:07,120
which is shipped with every component

00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:09,280
where sometimes if I'm lucky the

00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:12,280
upstream maintainer will in the text of

00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,650
the description say this package depends

00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:16,990
on x and y and z not in a machine

00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:18,940
possible way but in a text way where i

00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:20,680
can read it and i can manually say okay

00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:24,970
let me add these requires that map up to

00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:27,160
that or because there are fields in the

00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:31,900
metadata to do that but no tech package

00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:33,220
has ever used them so understanding

00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,570
dependencies the only way I do it is

00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:36,010
when someone says hey I installed this

00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:37,270
tech package and it didn't work but it

00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,860
suddenly worked or I installed this

00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:40,960
other thing I was like cool let me go

00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:43,560
add that requires and now it now works

00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,560
for more people

00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:46,969
[Music]

00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:52,680
yes if I had a way to do that yeah I

00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:55,170
would they are still using subversion

00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:58,800
for their version control for everything

00:38:55,170 --> 00:39:00,600
and as far as I know no no they've been

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,740
using subversion for a long time I think

00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,140
they were one of the big ones that

00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:06,540
adopted subversion first which in theory

00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:08,970
is great but in practice I don't believe

00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:12,570
any it's there they're apples are very

00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:15,660
odd and so only certain people have

00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:18,000
access to commit to core tech and it's a

00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:20,730
very limited list and there's no clear

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,340
way usually I end up emailing the person

00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:25,950
who does the releases and saying hi it's

00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:27,840
me again here are all my dumps and you

00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:31,080
haven't told me to go away and so please

00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:33,390
consider applying some of these yeah

00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:35,490
it's it's it's good times on average I

00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:38,010
end up pulling about when I do a major

00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:39,600
tech update I pull out about 10 new

00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:41,610
packages because they were non free

00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,080
every time we do a massive update and

00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:46,620
this one that I'm working on right now

00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:47,850
for 2019 is looking to be significantly

00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:55,650
worse than anything we've had in the

00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:57,090
last three years so essentially they

00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:58,740
don't publish these in any sort of the

00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:00,150
same way they don't do a change log that

00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:01,590
says these are the new packages and

00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:04,260
these are the ones that are going away I

00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:06,780
have to figure it out from context so I

00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:08,580
have to I have to pull the metadata list

00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,900
which lists although requires the

00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,220
metadata packages are actually really

00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,010
good about listing their explicit

00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:15,840
requires because that's all they do and

00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:17,070
then going through each one of them

00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,720
comparing them with to what we had in

00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:28,320
the last major release determining the

00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:29,880
new ones my notebook here this is where

00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,040
I'm currently at in the list these are

00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,840
all new packages that have to be created

00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:36,150
for the tech live package and then

00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,710
reviewed and audited for license and

00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:39,000
this is more of them that I haven't

00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:43,080
finished I'm about halfway through the

00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:46,350
meta packages nor was I had to do about

00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:47,070
75 packages to go to 2018 and this time

00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:50,570
it looks like it's gonna be

00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:50,570
significantly worse than that so

00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:03,560
it it never worked the automation that

00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:06,440
was written you nerd wrote good code

00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:08,330
that maybe worked once and it never

00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,950
worked again and then he disappeared and

00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:12,500
then there was no way to ask him how did

00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:14,030
this ever work and when I reverse

00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:16,460
engineered as much of it as I could to

00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:18,290
figure out how to make it go again it

00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:20,120
was this thing where there was a mix of

00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:21,650
C and Python and you had to run them in

00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,270
the right order and then rerun them

00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:25,190
against the generators back and then you

00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:26,750
had to keep me you were shuffling so

00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:28,370
often that you were actually hurting

00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:31,700
yourself by trying to use these tools as

00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:33,410
opposed to despite the fact that it

00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:35,060
usually takes me as extensive period of

00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:36,620
time it's still better to do it manually

00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:46,520
because they auto-generated results were

00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:48,140
so poor how is it in in Debian so one of

00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:50,630
the fun things that I've discovered and

00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:52,640
working as but or illegal is that Debian

00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:55,670
legal does a piss-poor job most of the

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,470
time of catching stuff like this no I

00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:59,930
and then I'm down the record as having

00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:03,650
said it repeatedly it's well intentioned

00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:06,020
but stuff that existed before Debbie and

00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:09,560
legal existed has never been audited and

00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:12,440
so a lot of times what happens is there

00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,820
is a there is one specific individual I

00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,930
do not know his real name because he

00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:17,360
does not use it in any of our

00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:19,010
correspondence or bugs or anything who

00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,450
goes through Debian legals bugs and

00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:21,890
assigns them all to fedora if they're

00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:23,930
relevant he checks to see if we have the

00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:26,060
package and he opens a fedora bug and he

00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:27,650
does the inverse when he discovers that

00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:29,210
I've changed something and fixed

00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:32,450
something and he watches all of my

00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:33,860
commits which must be miserable because

00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:35,960
a lot of my commits have nothing to do

00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:37,790
with legal and he watches all of my

00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,560
commits and when he sees something that

00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:41,030
is a legal related to commit he goes out

00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,920
to every other distribution on the

00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:44,900
planet and he opens a bug against it and

00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,820
so Debbie and legal hates me because

00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:49,040
they because every time I pick something

00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:50,720
they get all these bugs just opened up

00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,040
and I'm not doing it this other

00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,840
individual was doing a Matt never

00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:56,660
suggested that he should be doing these

00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:58,550
but he is and so debian plays catch-up

00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:00,290
on a lot of the things that we do one of

00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:02,289
the fun things I did a coach a few years

00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:03,910
ago was I had when I had a

00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:06,089
their lengthy list of things I knew were

00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:08,469
non-free that we were trying to get out

00:43:06,089 --> 00:43:10,509
someone suggested to me in a conference

00:43:08,469 --> 00:43:13,119
that I should simply use one of the free

00:43:10,509 --> 00:43:15,189
software foundations respects your

00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,809
freedom certified distributions because

00:43:15,189 --> 00:43:19,299
all of these problems must be fixed

00:43:16,809 --> 00:43:20,589
there and so I got bored and I pulled

00:43:19,299 --> 00:43:22,029
every one of them open and found all of

00:43:20,589 --> 00:43:23,229
our issues sitting in all of those

00:43:22,029 --> 00:43:25,509
distributions and pointed out that

00:43:23,229 --> 00:43:27,699
exactly none of the free software

00:43:25,509 --> 00:43:30,459
foundations respect your freedom

00:43:27,699 --> 00:43:31,809
distributions were actually 100% free

00:43:30,459 --> 00:43:33,309
because none of them had been audited on

00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:35,169
that level and the things I was aware of

00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:36,640
worrying all of them well that's not

00:43:35,169 --> 00:43:38,140
true there was one that I couldn't find

00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,359
the source code for because it had died

00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:53,380
so in theory that one might have been

00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:56,049
fully correct I just was on well again

00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:57,849
it was it was at that at that window of

00:43:56,049 --> 00:44:00,999
time it was things like SGI freebie

00:43:57,849 --> 00:44:03,279
which everyone knew was in acts and was

00:44:00,999 --> 00:44:05,499
non free there was no jurisdiction in

00:44:03,279 --> 00:44:07,659
which anyone thought it was but everyone

00:44:05,499 --> 00:44:10,449
did not want to be running without it

00:44:07,659 --> 00:44:12,069
and so everyone who was using X was

00:44:10,449 --> 00:44:14,259
running it and so it was like are you

00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:16,029
using X yes do you have freebie yes okay

00:44:14,259 --> 00:44:17,259
your non free let's keep moving and it

00:44:16,029 --> 00:44:18,369
was like check check check check check

00:44:17,259 --> 00:44:19,839
and this was something that it was just

00:44:18,369 --> 00:44:22,059
the dirty little secret now we've gotten

00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:23,439
that all relicensed at this point thanks

00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:28,119
to the rotting corpse of the remnants of

00:44:23,439 --> 00:44:32,769
SGI but but it's one of those situations

00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:34,179
where sometimes we know things are

00:44:32,769 --> 00:44:35,589
non-free and we are actively working

00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:36,999
with the license holders to try to

00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:38,469
resolve them at the moment there's

00:44:36,999 --> 00:44:40,749
nothing in fedora that I'm aware of that

00:44:38,469 --> 00:44:43,229
meets that criteria but in the past that

00:44:40,749 --> 00:44:46,409
has been true and it may be true again

00:44:43,229 --> 00:44:46,409
go ahead

00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:56,750
not that I know of that doesn't mean

00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:59,900
that we don't because I don't hand audit

00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:01,190
everything that comes in it's possible

00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:03,170
that something has slipped through the

00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:05,890
cracks where some no one's noticed it

00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:08,090
because it's like a test file in a Perl

00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:09,830
package that no one ever looks at

00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:11,930
because it always passes and it was

00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:13,640
taken from something else I don't want

00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:15,740
to say with authority that there is

00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:17,390
never anything but we do a really good

00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:19,400
job of trying to prevent it and if you

00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:21,290
ever see anything that you're not sure

00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,670
about you can immediately file a bug on

00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:24,470
it now investigate and we'll get it

00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:26,000
resolved one way or the other we're not

00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:28,040
in a situation like we were with free

00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,580
beware we didn't want to have to gut all

00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:36,550
of the GL support in order to make our

00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:36,550
distribution free yes

00:45:50,020 --> 00:46:11,410
I think that what is true so I think

00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:14,770
that part of the problem is that

00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:20,590
traditional software licensing triggers

00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:22,180
on distribution and that is the way that

00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:24,610
most of our licenses are structured and

00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:28,980
in cloud computing the concept of

00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:35,640
distribution becomes much more vague and

00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:37,870
yes and so or cloudy if you wish so

00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:41,500
being able to look at that and determine

00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:42,940
how and win licenses trigger industry

00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:46,240
when is the active distribution

00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:47,890
happening because you have the same sort

00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,990
of divide for people in that space that

00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:52,330
you have in the non cloud computing

00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:54,310
space there are folks who are on all

00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:58,540
edges of the spectrum from extreme

00:46:54,310 --> 00:47:00,280
copyleft to extreme permissive and right

00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:01,750
now we don't have a range of licenses

00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:04,660
that are designed to deal with cloud

00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:06,160
computing that across the spectrum cover

00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:08,050
those sorts of cases and clearly

00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:11,020
indicate that when you are using this

00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:13,600
software in a cloud context then these

00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:15,250
sorts of requirements apply to you the

00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:17,680
only real one that is out there that is

00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:19,420
doing this is a GPL and so what most

00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,250
cloud computing projects are doing is

00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:23,230
they're using existing software licenses

00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:25,630
in the context that may not be a hundred

00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:27,820
percent applicable to people and so

00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:29,740
there's this ambiguity of am i

00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:33,100
distributing when I'm running this or

00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:35,260
not if my cloud computing package is

00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,850
mostly JavaScript because it's running

00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:38,260
through browser am i distributing when

00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:40,120
the browser downloads those files and

00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:43,240
runs them does it count when there

00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:45,160
minified all of these sorts of factors

00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,390
come into play and then so there's a lot

00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,890
of people who are starting to think

00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:49,840
about these problems in more depth

00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:52,150
because people are starting to make real

00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:54,550
money using these things and when people

00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:56,530
start to make money using things then

00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:58,060
the lawyers show up and say hey here's

00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:59,860
how you can get some of that money and

00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:00,140
then the new licenses come out of the

00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:03,560
what

00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:06,380
and so you you fully expect that in five

00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:08,150
years we'll have a lot more licenses in

00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:09,190
this space you have to deal with and

00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:11,660
we're already starting to see people

00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:13,730
trying to write these licenses on

00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:15,860
cocktail napkins and submit them

00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:18,140
upstream now for the most part these

00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:19,820
aren't being written by lawyers and the

00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:21,680
only exception to that is the lawyer who

00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:23,180
is writing licenses that are plainly

00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:31,460
malicious and attempting to get their

00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:33,200
clients more money so the only times

00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:38,060
I've ever seen licenses go end of

00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:40,130
license end of life or things where the

00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:43,100
only entities using that license

00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:46,640
dissolve or go away a lot of sons

00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:49,610
terrible licenses are dying because son

00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:51,140
is gone for all intents and purposes

00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:54,590
I mean Oracle still continues to kick

00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:56,570
some of them forward but licenses don't

00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:58,280
ever go away as long as the internet

00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:59,540
remembers them so it's entirely

00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,130
plausible that someone will come and

00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:14,300
pick out my bad license and start using

00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:15,740
it again so the question is is is there

00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,710
ever a scenario in which the Justice

00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:19,700
League which to be clear is the OSI

00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:21,350
determines that a license is no longer

00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:24,110
permissible for people to use and they

00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:25,610
say this is no longer open source using

00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:27,980
this license was open source for the

00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:30,020
long time that it was and now it isn't

00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:31,370
they've argued about this at length to

00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:33,140
try to figure out because they did

00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:34,880
approve some licenses that they probably

00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:38,930
shouldn't have and called them open

00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:40,340
source and they can't come to consensus

00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:41,630
on this at this point they may at some

00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:43,130
point in the future come to some

00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:45,200
consensus I think one of the big

00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:47,510
dilemmas there is if something was

00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,010
open-source yesterday and I make the

00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:51,320
license go away and I still you want to

00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:53,300
use that source code is it not open

00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:55,400
source tomorrow did that magically

00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:57,350
change and then dealing with all the

00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,970
grandfathered cases do you then document

00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:01,280
all the cases where you were aware that

00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:02,990
something is being used and then how do

00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,970
you deal with all the private island

00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:06,860
concerns where someone's using this in

00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:08,150
private and zooming that is open source

00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:09,380
as a result of their use and not

00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:11,870
disclosing it to anyone because they're

00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:12,700
not required to are they now all of a

00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:14,470
sudden

00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,820
because they don't know it's not open

00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,170
source because they believed it was open

00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:20,800
source when they moved on to the island

00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:22,750
so yeah it becomes really complicated

00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,329
really quickly and they are incredibly

00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:28,150
disinterested in being an auditor of all

00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:31,150
software ever even github isn't thrilled

00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:33,369
about that idea so it's a hard problem

00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:35,320
but there are definitely cases where

00:50:33,369 --> 00:50:40,300
what they have done is they have listed

00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:42,490
licences as retired where they strongly

00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:44,560
encourage no one to pick these licenses

00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:46,750
up but they don't change the open-source

00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:49,119
status of those licenses they've done

00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:51,760
this with some really archaic licenses

00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:54,730
where the company used it once got OSI

00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,380
approval released once and then died and

00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:57,880
no one ever used their code as far as

00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,470
anyone could tell so there are some

00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:02,190
corner cases buried in their dusty

00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:02,190
cabinets but

00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:26,030
I think it's plausible that such cases

00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:28,490
exist I can't name one the closest

00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:32,000
analogy I can name is that when we did

00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:35,000
the license review for sendmail the

00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,820
legal determination was that it was free

00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,770
as long as it was for sendmail and it

00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:41,750
was done for the author of send mail and

00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:43,190
that if anyone else used that license it

00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:44,870
would probably be considered non free

00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:47,420
unless we went and talked to them and

00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:48,950
got explicit clarification because the

00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:50,840
only way we were able to consider send

00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:52,280
mail free was through direct and private

00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:57,470
correspondence with the upstream

00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:59,090
copyright holder yes and so if you go

00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:00,980
and you look at any licensing list for

00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:10,550
the sendmail license it says free as

00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:12,530
long as it's send mail that is a

00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:14,210
different sort of case where we where

00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:16,070
there are no no opps and all of the

00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:19,340
licenses that date back into a specific

00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:21,560
era but yes if we document in our

00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:23,570
lengthy licensing faq if you are so

00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:41,840
inclined to go really really deep into

00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:43,280
the rabbit hole I have not yeah no I

00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:45,080
would love to be able to figure out

00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,610
something where we could be intelligent

00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,960
and hard link all the copies of the

00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:49,820
license files that we ship and

00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,080
everything to minimize on disk base just

00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:53,000
a little bit it probably won't make a

00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:55,730
significant impact but if you are in a

00:52:53,000 --> 00:53:00,170
cloud or in a container situation where

00:52:55,730 --> 00:53:01,670
every single bit on the disk counts then

00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:04,340
being able to do that sort of a cleanup

00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:09,350
could be beneficial the difficulty is

00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:12,260
that for some licenses you can look at

00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:14,840
sums and compare GPL was almost never

00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:16,430
edited to amend for a copyright holder

00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,900
or date or anything like that people are

00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:20,450
usually just picking up a copy of

00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:23,020
copying or copying a lesser or copying

00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:29,140
library depending on your era

00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:31,000
and yeah and so we ate literally boils

00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:33,250
down to which of the six or seven

00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,860
variants of the GPL family licenses do

00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:38,590
you have and then comparing them against

00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:41,860
that some of the distributions I've seen

00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:43,930
what they do is they create a master

00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:45,520
license package that includes all the

00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:47,350
possible licenses that could ever exist

00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,320
in any of their packages and then make

00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:55,000
any build compose depend on it and so

00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:56,740
they I'm aware but that that's how they

00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,060
ensure that they are always shipping the

00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:59,890
licenses for everything they possibly

00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:01,570
could and don't worry about it on my

00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:03,340
package level basis because they have a

00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:04,810
licenses package that always will have

00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:23,350
your licenses they're always there for

00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:24,820
you to look at there's nothing that's

00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:26,740
preventing us from doing a common

00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:32,020
license packages in fedora other than

00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:33,400
that we've never done it and I for the

00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:34,420
most part people seem reasonably

00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,910
comfortable with

00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:38,680
now that rpm allow us to tag license

00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:41,080
files as license files and so they are

00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:42,730
specially tagged docx files that if you

00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:48,790
do know Doc's installs they still make

00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:51,400
it through there's enough variance in

00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:53,020
licenses that I would be really worried

00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:56,410
about trusting a common license this

00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:58,630
package as everything but if it helped

00:54:56,410 --> 00:55:00,220
enough people to simplify their

00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:02,020
packaging life in some way I wouldn't be

00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:03,370
opposed to it I'm not sure that it

00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:05,050
simplifies anything cuz it's really

00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:06,760
pretty straightforward to include the

00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:08,860
licensing in fedora packaging right now

00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,750
so you'd really have to come to me with

00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:12,280
a really compelling case or at least a

00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:13,950
mildly compelling case as to why we

00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:17,230
should do it

00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:18,819
is in the case where there's help

00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:28,540
streams that just reference the license

00:55:18,819 --> 00:55:30,130
name yeah there are a family of licenses

00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:32,619
and this is listed in the fedora license

00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:34,240
FAQ that require that a copy of the

00:55:32,619 --> 00:55:36,250
corresponding license be distributed

00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:38,290
along with it BSD is the most notable

00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:40,990
one of this family and so lots of times

00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:42,940
when upstream say BSD and don't include

00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:44,980
a copy of the license they are out of

00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:46,750
compliance however it is not possible

00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:48,910
for a copyright holder to be out of

00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:51,730
compliance with themselves so they can

00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:53,170
do it all day long and we have to add it

00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:55,690
but we also have to be sure that we are

00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:58,119
adding the BSD variant they intend so

00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:59,619
what we usually do in those cases as I

00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:01,329
end up filing a bug with the upstream in

00:55:59,619 --> 00:56:03,700
saying hey which of these bsds did you

00:56:01,329 --> 00:56:06,040
mean when you said BSD and if they don't

00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:08,829
resume and if they don't respond then I

00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:10,270
don't care because they clearly don't

00:56:08,829 --> 00:56:11,770
and the likelihood of them coming in

00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:13,930
saying you are infringing my copyright

00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:14,349
is simply responded to with me saying my

00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:16,480
bad

00:56:14,349 --> 00:56:17,829
what's your license exactly and then

00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,819
they provide me the license on we get

00:56:17,829 --> 00:56:20,349
people we wanted to get from the

00:56:18,819 --> 00:56:22,450
beginning so it's not something that

00:56:20,349 --> 00:56:23,710
we'd lose a lot of sleep about we do

00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:25,270
make a good-faith effort to try to

00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:27,640
determine what the license is in case

00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:29,770
they come back and say when I said BSD

00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:34,150
what I actually meant was bare standard

00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:36,329
you know license or something crazy like

00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:36,329
that

00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:02,170
and again usually in most of these cases

00:57:00,609 --> 00:57:03,819
the correct response is going to be to

00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:05,980
open that upstream ticket and say I'm

00:57:03,819 --> 00:57:09,790
attempting to confirm the the actual

00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:13,380
text of your license can you add that or

00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:15,520
tell me what it is and I will add it

00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:17,170
sometimes I've had success with up

00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,790
streams where they're on github where

00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:20,920
I'll do a straight pull request and say

00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:22,990
you seem to be MIT this is the standard

00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,120
OSI license text for MIT where you merge

00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:25,560
this or not and one

00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:27,240
nine times out of ten they merge it and

00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:28,710
I'm a great well you just you just

00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:30,270
confirmed what your licenses by having

00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:31,710
me write it for you but I don't care

00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:35,310
because we got the problem solved but

00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:37,110
I'm happy with that license text you're

00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:38,640
good if they merge it than they are de

00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:40,500
facto as the copyright holder saying

00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:42,570
that this is correct

00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:44,430
yeah I'm just saving them ten steps and

00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:47,150
so if that's what makes it happen then

00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:49,110
that's what makes it happen again

00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:50,730
sometimes and it doesn't work all the

00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:52,380
time sometimes upstream is like why

00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:53,730
would you write my license for me I

00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:55,110
would want to do that and then they go

00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:57,390
to the exact same thing and I'm like you

00:57:55,110 --> 00:58:00,480
know what knock yourself out I don't

00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:03,480
this is all fine the last thing I would

00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:05,760
say to the room into the video is if you

00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:12,720
believe that there is a patent situation

00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:15,270
involving your code please be vague when

00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:18,150
you report this publicly if you wish to

00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:23,060
be specific consider reporting it

00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:25,380
privately to me maybe even encrypted and

00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:27,660
there are reasons for that but I cannot

00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:29,490
go into but it would make my life a lot

00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:31,650
simpler if you would stop filing bugs

00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:33,300
that say things like hey I believe this

00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:36,960
violates patent number of dibs a dump

00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:40,050
them to dumped it on please don't do

00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:42,210
that obviously in those situations where

00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:43,740
that happens red hat and fedora do the

00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:50,480
responsible thing and deal with this

00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:50,480
appropriately obviously and clearly

00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,130
[Music]

00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:58,410
alright well there's no more questions

00:58:56,130 --> 00:59:00,060
on this I will be around for the rest of

00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:01,770
the flock you can come to me and quiet

00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:03,990
and be like okay so I have got this

00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:07,050
legal problem which inevitably is this

00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:08,280
the price of such questions is usually a

00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:09,840
alcoholic drink

00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,950
sometimes if after learning about the

00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:13,620
problem it may require additional

00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:16,590
alcoholic drinks but thank you for

00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:19,280
coming and and thank you for respecting

00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:19,280
legal and

00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:24,309
