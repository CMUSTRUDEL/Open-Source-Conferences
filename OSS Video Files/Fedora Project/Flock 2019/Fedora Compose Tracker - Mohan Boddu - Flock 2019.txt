Title: Fedora Compose Tracker - Mohan Boddu - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-08-28
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	Fedora Release Engineering runs a lot of composes everyday which include nightly composes and bodhi update pushes. We wanted to have a centralized location to track these failures and work collaboratively in fixing these failures. We also would like to add more features and metrics to the compose tracker. We would like to invite everyone who is interested in Fedora composes and how we can improve that process for their benefit.
