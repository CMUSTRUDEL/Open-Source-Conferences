The current way of enabling tests in the Fedora CI is awkward. There is repeated feedback that the configuration is hard to understand and write. Also its extensibility is quite limited. We want to change that so:

    Simple & common use cases are super simple to write
    The format is flexible enough to cover future extensions
    Concise and easily readable for both machines & humans
    Everything needed for testing & gating at one place
    Easier reuse of test cases across different distros
    Clear test steps separation allows easier local execution
    Support for inheritance to minimize duplication & maintenance

We've defined Level 1 and Level 2 metadata specification and would like to present a proof of concept on the systemd component showing how simple it could be to enable set of shared tests for continuously testing changes in GitHub, Fedora CI, CentOS CI...
