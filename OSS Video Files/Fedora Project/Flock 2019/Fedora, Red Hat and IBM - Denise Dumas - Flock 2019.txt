welcome to IBM oh wait so I wanted to

00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:17,920
ask is there anybody from the real IBM

00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:19,280
actually with us in this audience no oh

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,590
okay

00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,560
whoo all right we're good I can say my

00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:28,670
life okay but really welcome to

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:36,370
slideshow karaoke I hear it was really

00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:43,899
good all right what's gonna happen next

00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:46,520
so if you actually work for Red Hat

00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:49,510
you've probably seen this presentation

00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:53,809
about a million times

00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:59,270
Town Hall another town hall another town

00:00:53,809 --> 00:01:02,390
hall don't panic but if you don't work

00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:06,369
for IBM it for IBM for Red Hat whoo okay

00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:10,039
so who here does not work for Red Hat oh

00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:12,920
wow oh that's great

00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:15,770
that is actually really great I'm happy

00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:20,509
that's like 5050 oh well you guys are in

00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:23,289
for a treat well maybe not so if you

00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:28,159
haven't been following what's going on

00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:31,759
right I be M but Red Hat and the deal

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,409
finally closed in early July and that's

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,749
a big deal I mean we've been getting

00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:38,869
ready for this internally to Red Hat for

00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:41,630
quite a while and since a lot of the Red

00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:43,639
Hat folks work for fedora and since

00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:46,130
Fedora is such a big and important

00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:48,590
project that Red Hat participates in we

00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:52,039
wanted to talk a little bit about what

00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:54,590
that relationship is like and about the

00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:58,630
impact is what the impact is gonna be

00:01:54,590 --> 00:02:02,539
like on fedora okay short answer

00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:06,049
probably not a whole heck of a lot okay

00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:10,460
you can all go now well maybe not so

00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:13,310
much so IBM acquired Red Hat they paid a

00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:15,410
lot of money for Red Hat this is really

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:21,080
great if you happen to be a

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:22,790
of open-source IBM paid 34 billion

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:28,430
dollars for a company with no

00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:31,190
intellectual property right

00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:35,680
I mean how fabulous is that what does

00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:40,490
that say about the value of open-source

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:43,400
huge things good things what's

00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:46,670
interesting is that Red Hat is going to

00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,790
continue to operate as a distinct unit

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:51,980
so we don't lose our identity we don't

00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,110
lose our badges we don't lose our

00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,360
parking spaces yeah you guys you guys

00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,150
all have like named parking spaces right

00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:02,150
yeah I know I do

00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:09,940
yeah yeah no yeah

00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:12,440
in my dreams our mission stays the same

00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:15,020
which really you know it's a fabulous

00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,180
thing we've been taken over by the Borg

00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:21,020
and yet not right we are what is known

00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:22,970
now as an affiliated company this is

00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,680
what the legal guys tell me so that's

00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:29,600
that's the official terminology that

00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:32,420
they use what does that mean honestly I

00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,570
don't know except that I know that it's

00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,430
important when we are looking at some of

00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:40,370
the standards bodies that we have to

00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:42,410
deal with and places where IBM also

00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,000
participates in those standards bodies

00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,950
because then we have to negotiate

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,360
because you know if you're too

00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,130
affiliated companies

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,220
and you each had a board seat then you

00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:54,800
get to negotiate what happens so there's

00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,540
a lot of stuff that's going on as we try

00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,930
to figure out how this is all going to

00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:04,480
work but what I wanted to talk about

00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:04,480
today was what is the impact on fedora

00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:16,280
and here's cut to the chase right Red

00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:19,400
Hat is still Red Hat our badges stay Red

00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:22,490
Hat badges our buildings stay Red Hat

00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:25,390
buildings IBM badges don't work in Red

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:29,710
Hat buildings and vice-versa right

00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:35,540
there's not a lot of cross-pollination

00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:38,900
that's going on yet maybe over time but

00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:42,800
the important thing is that we are

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:44,900
affiliated we are not like IBM and it's

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,630
been really interesting to talk with the

00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,970
people who've been part of the so-called

00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:54,350
cleanroom as we've gone through this

00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:57,980
acquisition because IBM huge company

00:04:54,350 --> 00:05:00,440
right jinora --mess and they have their

00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:02,180
own special team that does mergers and

00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,630
acquisitions because they do so many of

00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:08,540
them every year but for the Red Hat deal

00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:13,280
that team they didn't even get involved

00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:15,440
because this deal is special which i

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,270
think is is actually interesting because

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,120
if you've ever worked for a big company

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:23,030
how many people here have worked work

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:26,300
for big companies right very much yeah

00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:28,750
oh yeah okay yeah you guys okay

00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:32,210
but you haven't seen anything yet right

00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:35,330
so I at one time worked for HP when it

00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:37,700
was you know 170,000 people big

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:40,160
companies things get lost they have

00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,870
process for the sake of process for the

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,310
sake of process because that's all you

00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,650
can do right if you don't have a process

00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:49,730
nobody knows what to do so I think it's

00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:51,980
fascinating that IBM huge company was

00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:55,490
willing to discard their merger and

00:05:51,980 --> 00:06:00,080
acquisition process in order to do the

00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:04,400
right thing with Red Hat so Red Hat is

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:09,020
still Red Hat if you were at the Red Hat

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,610
summit this year I know a lot of you

00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,490
work as I saw you there you were

00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:16,790
backstage right while Ginny was on stage

00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,290
talking with Jim our CEO so for those of

00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:22,009
you who don't know Ginni Rometty

00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:25,610
is IBM CEO what does it mean to be

00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:28,729
CEO of a company with 381 thousand

00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,589
people I can't even imagine you try to

00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:31,879
put yourself into that position and say

00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:33,399
what does that even feel like when you

00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:36,800
wake up in the morning right

00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:40,099
but Ginny was at the summit talking with

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,749
Jim our CEO and I know some of you were

00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:43,520
like backstage while all of this was

00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:45,889
going on right we're waiting to come out

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,960
and fire t-shirt cannons to celebrate

00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:53,749
rally release that was really good

00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:57,770
but Ginny her my favorite quote I don't

00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:59,509
have a death wish she just spent thirty

00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:04,240
four billion dollars to buy red hat

00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:04,240
that's not like buying shoes you know

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,860
it's not like I have a death wish over

00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:13,969
thirty four billion dollars not like I'm

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:18,409
buying them to destroy them this gives

00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:22,219
me hope I think that Ginny knew exactly

00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:23,959
what she was buying I would also be

00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:29,870
willing to bet that a lot of the other

00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:32,629
people at IBM had no clue and probably

00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:36,620
still are just learning about what is

00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:38,809
this really mean but if you go out on

00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:41,569
YouTube and and look for the Red Hat

00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:43,969
summit talk in which this quote from

00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:45,620
which this quote comes there is some

00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:51,050
other really interesting things that

00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:54,019
Ginny said that day she said that we're

00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:59,209
on a mission together now to scale

00:07:54,019 --> 00:08:01,490
open-source she gets the mission right

00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:04,339
and for Red Hat

00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,959
you know without really deep pockets

00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:08,389
it's really hard to do the level of

00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:10,729
investment that you need to grow and so

00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:12,229
for Red Hat this works kind of nicely we

00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:17,149
think because there's a lot of synergy

00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:21,909
between the two companies iBM has been a

00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:24,800
partner of Red Hat's for many years and

00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:28,629
so you guys know right how much iBM has

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:34,760
contributed over the years to fedora

00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:35,750
yeah I mean Fedora builds power fedora

00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:40,310
builds eye

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:42,590
your mainframe systems II we didn't do

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:45,350
that work IBM did that work right along

00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:49,210
with some help from our friends so

00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:51,740
they've been with us all along here but

00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:53,860
but that actually comes back to another

00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:57,620
thing that Ginny said during this talk

00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:00,200
talking about open source and what I

00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:04,660
like is that she gets it cuz she said if

00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:07,490
you're going to take you have to give

00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:09,820
which are also actually fabulous words

00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:13,190
to live by for life in general right but

00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:17,120
but it's really important if you're an

00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:19,010
open source company you can't just take

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,990
you have to give back and you have to

00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:24,470
think about how you're gonna do that you

00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:27,770
know over the years we've actually seen

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:32,210
IBM do that in many different up streams

00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:35,060
I mean starting with things like GCC so

00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:38,420
I'm optimistic because I know that Ginny

00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,920
gets it and if you CEO gets it then

00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:43,100
there's a chance that it's gonna trickle

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:47,810
down right but I also am 100% certain

00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:50,210
that everybody doesn't get it but the

00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:54,770
deal is that Red Hat is gonna remain

00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:56,270
independent and neutral so when you

00:09:54,770 --> 00:10:01,190
think about it it makes perfect sense

00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:04,010
right if you have to partner with

00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:07,580
somebody in order to get your changes

00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:11,540
into the kernel in order to get work

00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:14,420
done in support of your customers you

00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:16,910
have to trust so Red Hat is an arbiter

00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:19,730
right in many in many cases in some of

00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:21,560
the upstreamists that we're in and we

00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,330
represent the interests of our customers

00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,210
and we also represent the interests of

00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:29,450
our partners we partner with lots and

00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:31,040
lots and lots of hardware vendors Intel

00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:39,040
AMD arm Oh

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:43,040
IBM Dell Lenovo HP Mellanox

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:47,570
Solar Flare right cloud provider is

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,040
Google Amazon if you're going to partner

00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:51,139
with people

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,970
companies like that if they're gonna

00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:58,430
trust you you have to be trustworthy you

00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:00,110
have to maintain confidentiality you

00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,880
can't share information about what's

00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:07,310
going on at Google with the folks at

00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:09,259
Amazon you have to maintain you can't

00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:12,290
tell the Dell folks what HP is gonna

00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:15,560
ship next week right so you have to be a

00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:18,019
trustworthy partner an IBM totally

00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:23,630
understands that red hat's value lies in

00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:27,440
being a trustworthy partner if our

00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:32,120
partners can't trust us then there goes

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,680
thirty four billion dollars and you know

00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,769
they don't you might as well just like

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,829
set flame to the money right although

00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:41,660
that would kind of be a big stack you

00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:43,790
probably had yeah so you okay all right

00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:48,560
so you'd need an incendiary bomb right

00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:51,680
but so red hat has to be an independent

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,889
and neutral actually we've worked with

00:11:51,680 --> 00:12:05,870
IBM over the years where's Peter

00:11:54,889 --> 00:12:08,360
Robinson no he's sleeping it off okay

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:12,440
he's been spotted he was reminding me

00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:15,790
the other day of how IBM worked with him

00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:19,519
during the during the days of Fedora 22

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:21,350
so in Fedora 22 they were working on

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,910
their power nine Hardware bring up so

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,519
they would they were doing they had a

00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:28,699
simulator for their hardware and they

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:31,010
were taken snaps of rawhide every day

00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:33,829
and using that for their hardware bring

00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:35,990
up which I think is is a pretty

00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:38,630
interesting indicator of how long

00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:40,430
they've participated in fedora well

00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:45,040
Dennis will tell you right didn't you

00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:45,040
set up the infrastructure that yeah

00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,290
mm-hmm yeah they provided a lot of

00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:54,270
hardware to the builders over the years

00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:57,210
they provided hardware to the

00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:59,880
universities in Brno so that they have

00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:02,430
open power right so they've been a good

00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:05,760
partner all this time and so I know that

00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:09,510
at least parts of IBM understand how

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,250
open-source works of course the issue

00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:13,530
with a company of three hundred and

00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,570
eighty-one thousand people is that the

00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:17,760
parts of IBM that we've worked with are

00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:20,190
probably not the biggest parts of IBM

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,670
and so there's gonna be a learning curve

00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:30,620
here for everybody and that's just the

00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:33,390
way big companies are so Red Hat

00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,830
independence neutrality right we're not

00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:40,910
gonna we're not gonna trash that

00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:44,040
investment these slides are the official

00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:47,640
marketing slides to some extent as you

00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,650
can maybe tell because the messaging is

00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,890
important right this is a real big deal

00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:55,590
and they need to make sure that we hold

00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:58,680
to the party line so you guys are all

00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:06,500
sworn to secrecy oh wait no no no wait a

00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:06,500
minute we're open so what about fedora

00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:18,750
will anything change who here is afraid

00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:24,960
that something's gonna change look an

00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:29,340
honest man yeah yeah you know I think

00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:35,720
the operative question is will anything

00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:41,070
change because of IBM right because

00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:43,590
things change all the time I've seen

00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:45,330
fedora for 11 years some of you guys

00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:48,150
have seen fedora for a lot longer than

00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:53,910
11 years how many changes have you lived

00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:58,140
through in fedora yeah all of them yeah

00:14:53,910 --> 00:15:00,170
oh yes Steven well so an interesting

00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,820
thing for me as as I put

00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:03,920
is to get these slides together I

00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,750
started thinking about all of the

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,639
changes that Fedora has gone through

00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,120
just in the 11 years that I've seen it

00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:12,230
right

00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:14,839
I've watched things like rings morph

00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:17,300
into modularity now moving into

00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:20,149
minimization right as we think about the

00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,829
to fast to slow problem and experiment

00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:26,300
to try to find approaches for dealing

00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:30,110
with that I got thinking back to the

00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:33,709
days when I first saw fedora where it

00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:36,380
was all about spec files and packaging

00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:41,449
and the packaging committee was God

00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:45,110
right and it was really hard to get any

00:15:41,449 --> 00:15:48,920
changes at all to happen for the best

00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:50,930
possible reasons and from really good

00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:54,589
motivations right people wanted to

00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:58,160
reduce risks people wanted to to make

00:15:54,589 --> 00:16:01,910
sure that continuity was preserved but

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:05,029
when you don't change or when you fight

00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:07,640
really hard not to change then you

00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:11,600
actually introduced the biggest risk of

00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:17,209
all which is the risk that you're gonna

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:19,940
be disrupted and become obsolete and so

00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:22,940
I think that it's really great for me to

00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:25,630
see how Fedora has changed over the

00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:28,399
years and become a lot less risk-averse

00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:31,820
and a lot more willing to contemplate

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:35,949
changes and to be more experimental and

00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:39,940
to try the things that we've needed in

00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:43,910
order to remain an important

00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:46,190
distribution so that's been a great

00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:48,230
thing for me to observe and I know

00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:50,690
that's been hard on a lot of people over

00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:53,839
the years right but it's it's wonderful

00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:56,600
to see how people have adapted to many

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,069
of those changes I couldn't well alright

00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,810
I was debating whether I should even say

00:16:58,069 --> 00:17:04,120
this right but I can remember the days

00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:07,040
when Fedora developed was scary yeah

00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,860
yeah you guys remember right remember

00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:13,550
when the gnome team didn't talk to the

00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:16,820
fedora team and a desktop chain

00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:18,620
would come sweeping in and it would land

00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:22,580
like a boulder into the middle of a

00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:26,150
swimming pool and the ripples would be

00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:35,090
felt on Fedora de velas for months house

00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:39,380
audio system date yeah yeah so those

00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:41,000
days are long behind us I mean I think

00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:44,180
it's safe for 12 year olds to read

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,930
fedora de velas now right and you know

00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:49,220
it's a much nicer place because

00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:50,450
everybody has said wait a minute

00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:55,610
I don't want to work that way I'm

00:17:50,450 --> 00:18:00,790
willing to change so the the reason I go

00:17:55,610 --> 00:18:04,280
into all of this is because change

00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:09,410
change is gonna happen change is

00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:13,220
actually a good thing change really is

00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:17,480
the only constant and Fedora has been

00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:20,630
changing constantly for many years you

00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:23,990
know it's not always steadily up right

00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:25,850
sometimes it's a step function right

00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:28,160
sometimes you know what is this saying

00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:33,770
you have to kiss a few frogs before you

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:37,970
find your prince well okay we've met a

00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:42,020
few frogs it's not it's you know but you

00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:44,720
have to be willing to try and this is a

00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:47,380
thing that I think IBM understands right

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:52,490
there is no expectation of perfection

00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:56,240
perfection is stasis perfection is death

00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:58,730
right you've evolved into such a perfect

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,990
niche you've cornered your market on

00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:07,010
obsolete so I hope Fedora is never

00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:11,120
perfect because I want Fedora to remain

00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:13,160
alive and vibrant with challenging ideas

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:17,120
and new things to try right remember

00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:20,750
when cloud images came in think about

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:26,940
atomic weight think about how project

00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:28,619
atomic core OS two kind of competing

00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,989
trying to solve the same kinds of

00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:33,239
problems now we've got Fedora core OS

00:19:30,989 --> 00:19:35,940
that's taken good features out of both

00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:39,330
of those projects and is moving forward

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:41,669
with it and this this is what we want

00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:44,099
look at the desktop right look at

00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:47,929
silver-blue it's fascinating it's

00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:53,220
exciting flat packs so this is an era

00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:56,970
when change is rolling over us we're

00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:59,190
riding the wave and I don't see so

00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:02,159
here's I was thinking about in my worst

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:07,799
possible world right what happens when

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:10,440
IBM takes over oh my god some financial

00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:12,619
genius who thinks he's a technologist at

00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,820
IBM this is my worst nightmare

00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:18,809
financial genius thinks he's a

00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:21,179
technologist says well upstream why are

00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:24,239
we supporting upstream we don't need no

00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:28,669
stinkin upstream that's expensive hey I

00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:31,259
think we can do a commercial rock-solid

00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:35,970
enterprise-class distribution without

00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:37,679
all that messy upstream stuff alright so

00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:42,599
what do I think the odds are that this

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:47,099
is gonna happen not just 8020 rule right

00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:50,179
we're talking vanishingly low I'm saying

00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:59,450
like weird where it's zero with that one

00:20:50,179 --> 00:21:03,509
here's my other worst nightmare 381

00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:08,039
thousand people who wanna be our new

00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:10,710
best friends okay

00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:14,729
maybe 200,000 of them are sales dudes

00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:16,499
right so all right we're gonna we're not

00:21:14,729 --> 00:21:18,269
gonna count the sales guys that's still

00:21:16,499 --> 00:21:23,129
a hundred and eighty one thousand people

00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:25,259
with a technical clue and I know iBM has

00:21:23,129 --> 00:21:29,299
a lot of smart technical people right

00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:29,299
cuz I've hired a bunch of them

00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:37,510
I'm sure some we've got escapees here

00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:39,790
right but I know they've got really good

00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:44,490
smart technical people they have where

00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:47,710
we're from IBM we want to help you so

00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:49,630
that is actually for me a thing that

00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:55,090
we're gonna have to be cautious about

00:21:49,630 --> 00:22:01,960
right it's a whole different world cuz

00:21:55,090 --> 00:22:10,650
what is 380 1000 people really mean this

00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:17,170
looks like the Death Star right but but

00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:19,810
381 at IBM 14k at Red Hat maybe a

00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:25,570
thousand really active Fedora

00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:27,760
contributors we're outnumbered so what

00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:33,130
I'm hoping for and what I believe is

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:34,900
gonna happen is that IBM is going to see

00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:38,710
it they're gonna get excited right I

00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:41,020
mean if you're an IBM and they've bought

00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:44,170
Red Hat and it's the best thing since

00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:46,960
sliced bread what are you gonna want to

00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:49,090
do I want to go where the action is

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:53,500
right I want to go work in an upstream

00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:55,150
you bet can I please so I think that

00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,670
we're gonna see more of them

00:22:55,150 --> 00:23:00,880
participating with us and it's gonna be

00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:03,130
something that we'll manage because I

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,630
don't think you know 180 1000 of them

00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:09,070
are gonna show up overnight they've got

00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:11,560
day jobs right just like us I think that

00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:14,680
there's an opportunity here for us to

00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:16,420
have more participation and we should be

00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,340
thinking about if they're going to

00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,680
participate what what would we like

00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,630
right where can they help other than in

00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:26,590
power and ze hardware where they've

00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:28,120
always participated I'm sure that there

00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:32,670
are projects that could use a little

00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,670
help but

00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:41,490
yeah so so you know it could go I mean

00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:45,930
it could be really a good thing for

00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:49,950
Fedora as long as we're not overwhelmed

00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:51,540
and that's why you just but it's gonna

00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:56,490
be really hard to overwhelm Fedora I

00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:58,200
think when we see those IBM addresses

00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:04,020
start showing up on Fedora tavella's

00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:07,380
right but here's the really interesting

00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:10,680
thing for me so I was watching and ask

00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:16,370
me anything with Chris Wright who is Red

00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:19,950
Hat CTO and somebody asked Chris about

00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:22,440
red hats policy for contributing to open

00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:26,130
source projects and whether that was

00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:29,010
going to affect IBM's policy and Chris

00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:30,570
Farris who is IBM CTO for open

00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:32,160
technologies you didn't know that role

00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:37,080
existed did you I didn't either

00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:40,440
yeah so Chris Ferriss jumped into the

00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:42,900
discussion and told everybody something

00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:46,530
that I find personally really exciting

00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:49,530
he said that after the acquisition IBM

00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:53,520
changed their policy for their engineers

00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:55,160
about contributing to open source so now

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,650
yeah

00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,650
[Applause]

00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:06,160
yeah go IBM so now you don't need

00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:07,780
permission from IBM to work on open

00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:11,710
source technologies in your spare time

00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:14,710
just like Red Hat's always been and I

00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:17,020
think that's a great promise that is a

00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:20,559
step into a whole new world for these

00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:24,039
guys so that gives me hope

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:29,260
right because IBM didn't have to do that

00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:30,940
I mean it would have been you know all

00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:34,210
of the IBM technical guys would have

00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:37,179
wanted to move to a red hat but at least

00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:39,130
I would but but I be owned didn't have

00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:41,110
to do that and I'm really glad to see

00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:46,330
them thinking that way because they see

00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:49,770
this acquisition as a way to move IBM

00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:53,860
well not into this century right because

00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:56,409
iBM has a fabulous research arm when

00:25:53,860 --> 00:26:00,070
they are doing really really really

00:25:56,409 --> 00:26:02,620
interesting things looking way out in

00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:04,809
terms of where technology is going but

00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:07,210
they're gonna bring more of that to the

00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:09,220
world of open source I mean they've got

00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:13,780
quantum computers up and running right

00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:15,880
how cool is that so so this I think is

00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,799
gonna be really encouraging if I were a

00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:21,640
regular IBM guy I would be looking at

00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:23,440
this same ya go in the meantime Red

00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,049
Hat's relationship with fedora doesn't

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:31,679
change right Red Hat depends upon fedora

00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:34,240
I hope this is not news to anybody hmm

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,640
yeah without fedora

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,500
we don't have rel and without rel we

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:43,620
lose a huge amount of revenue and you

00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:46,630
know yadda yadda yadda right so so

00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:51,480
because Red Hat depends upon fedora as

00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:55,929
well we put our money where our mouth is

00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:57,520
open source if you don't give you don't

00:26:55,929 --> 00:26:59,500
get right or at least that's the way

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,870
that it should be and so Red Hat

00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,880
contributes a lot to fit of so how many

00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:09,820
of you are from Red Hat here traveling

00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:12,070
on Red Hat's travel budget yep yep how

00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:17,830
many of you does Red Hat pay to work

00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:19,780
full-time on Fedora yep this is good

00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:23,160
right this is the way it's supposed to

00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:26,590
be so I don't see any of this changing

00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:29,380
because it's a synergistic relationship

00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:32,140
it works well for both sides at least I

00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:34,120
hope it does and for the non Red Hat

00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:36,910
part of Fedora I hope that you see it

00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:39,190
working right because an open-source

00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:44,110
community really needs to be a community

00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:46,810
it can't just be one big gorilla yeah it

00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:49,120
needs to be partnerships it needs to be

00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:51,850
wait you've probably seen the

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:55,120
proprietary company model of doing open

00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:59,970
source you take your big blob of source

00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:03,310
code and one day it goes out to github

00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:07,450
surprise and now you're open you got a

00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:08,770
community right oh wait no but that's

00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:11,020
the way that a lot of proprietary

00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:13,480
companies have seen open source over the

00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:15,070
years and that is not the way that Red

00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,940
Hat operates and that's not the way that

00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:21,130
we're ever gonna operate you know so I

00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,600
should say as God is my witness right

00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:28,690
I'll do that gone with the wind thing

00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:31,090
but but Red Hat depends upon Fedora it's

00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:34,110
not a real presentation unless you get

00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:34,110
to say hybrid cloud

00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:47,659
I am totally buzzword compliant so the

00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:50,870
innovation engine for a hybrid cloud is

00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:55,429
Linux yeah

00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:58,580
but of course I mean Linux is what's

00:28:55,429 --> 00:29:00,169
underneath while in a hybrid clouds well

00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:03,230
most of not maybe not as you're right

00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:05,750
but I mean KVM is underneath Amazon

00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:08,690
right KVM is underneath Google KVM is

00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:10,580
underneath Alibaba and Linux is the main

00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:12,649
workload that's riding on top of those

00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:14,000
clouds that's what people those are the

00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:17,539
workloads that people are bringing into

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:22,039
those clouds so this is where it's all

00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:24,620
happening and that's great right Linux

00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:29,510
is clearly the superior operating system

00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:32,120
for hybrid clouds but and you know I

00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:34,220
know you guys know this I'm sure nobody

00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,380
is surprised by this right Fedora is the

00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:40,909
upstream for realm no fedora

00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:42,799
Norrell just doesn't happen and rel is

00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:45,200
where Red Hat makes its money and rel is

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,820
what helps ready out survive so guess

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:53,360
what you guys are really important to

00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:56,480
Red Hat survival yeah you and how

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:59,929
important is that though really not just

00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:05,000
to Red Hat survival but to the world in

00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:07,639
general we did a study with Gartner they

00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,500
took a look at a bunch of customers they

00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:11,570
were focusing specifically on customers

00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,919
who run rel because you know ready I was

00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:15,350
paying for the study right that's what

00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:18,080
you got but but they looked at those

00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:21,620
customers and they realized that if

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:25,460
you're running rail collectively they

00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:27,769
saved seven billion dollars because they

00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:31,370
were running rel and I think that that's

00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:33,710
a pretty big impact I mean I would take

00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:36,500
that right make seven billion dollars I

00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:38,059
think that's pretty impressive but then

00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,669
you look at what those customers were

00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:42,350
doing right and look at what people are

00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:45,679
doing with fedora look at what people

00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:48,740
are doing with cent OS right there

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,040
running the accelerators science is

00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:52,080
powered

00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:56,340
by linux science is powered by

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:59,370
open-source medicine is increasingly

00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:00,270
powered by open-source in the innovation

00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:04,070
that comes from it

00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:07,770
open-source is gonna change the world

00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:10,140
IBM gets that and that's why they want a

00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:12,720
partner with Red Hat and that's why Red

00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:14,460
Hat needs to be connected the way that

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:21,620
we are with all of the up streams that

00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:26,100
we work with oh and you know what

00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:28,110
another reason why fedora matters is it

00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,120
used to be that Red Hat had to go to

00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:32,580
customers and say hey this open-source

00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:37,340
thing it's really great you're gonna

00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:41,370
love it it's not like that anymore

00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:42,380
customers come to us now and say umm Red

00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:44,880
Hat

00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:46,290
you guys do open-source right we want

00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,880
open source some of them are not too

00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:52,860
sure what open source is but they want

00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:56,430
it they know they want it right look at

00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:59,790
Stack Overflow right developers want to

00:31:56,430 --> 00:32:02,190
work in the open they want to work on

00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:03,630
open source projects and they want their

00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:06,300
code to be out in the open because who

00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:09,690
wouldn't write your CV is there for

00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:12,900
every potential employer to say yeah I

00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:15,000
want to work in open source and so the

00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:18,000
world is changing and it becomes

00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,470
increasingly important and our customers

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,050
are telling us that it's important

00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:24,660
because our customers are another place

00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:27,360
where Red Hat actually in a really

00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:29,760
different kind of model goes out and

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:35,990
partners I mean we do development with

00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:38,100
our customers our customers all right

00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:40,410
I'm sure that there are more of our

00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,480
customers here but you know at places

00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:44,280
like the Red Hat summit the customers

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,050
come up and tell us the stories of how

00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,360
they've worked with Red Hat to get

00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:51,270
changes done upstream to make their

00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:54,390
projects work and how they increasingly

00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:57,450
are looking to the culture that comes

00:32:54,390 --> 00:33:00,290
along with open source to change the way

00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:03,840
that their companies operate internally

00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:06,150
in order to be faster in order not to

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,720
get disrupted in order to be part of the

00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:15,150
new world I mean do you wonder why IBM

00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:19,950
wanted to buy Red Hat and the

00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:23,370
opportunity that we look at is gonna be

00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:24,330
really interesting because Red Hat 40

00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,880
countries right

00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:31,610
and 40 countries that's still that's a

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:34,020
pretty big international footprint IBM

00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:37,200
170 I mean they could country the

00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:40,200
varying countries I can't even spell and

00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:44,120
and so that you know it's a bigger world

00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:49,740
we become part of a much bigger world

00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:51,929
here's the deal for IBM IBM products are

00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:54,240
gonna run better they're gonna be

00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:58,559
optimized to run better on RedHat

00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:01,169
infrastructure gee what's the basis of

00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:03,809
Red Hat infrastructure well

00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:09,270
well where does well come from well

00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:12,679
fedora right here's another one that I

00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:16,980
really like Red Hat has always

00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:19,200
participated in stem initiatives things

00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:21,839
like collab things like the women in

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,089
open source Awards we've we've tried to

00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:27,320
do a lot but you know 14,000 people

00:34:24,089 --> 00:34:32,190
today right our reach is not that big

00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:35,520
iBM is doing some amazing work they've

00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:39,960
got this thing called P tech pathways in

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:43,260
technology where they take kids in what

00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:45,089
in the u.s. is ninth grade so I don't

00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:49,169
know what is ninth grade that's thirteen

00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:53,010
thirteen years old they take them out of

00:34:49,169 --> 00:34:55,470
at-risk neighborhoods right demographics

00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:57,599
inner cities places where these kids

00:34:55,470 --> 00:35:00,000
might not have a chance places where you

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,490
know 50 years ago they might have been

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,080
able to go get a manufacturing job at an

00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:05,070
automobile plant but those jobs don't

00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:08,190
exist anymore

00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:10,500
those jobs are all robots now right even

00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:14,609
office work is increasingly automated

00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:16,440
and yet we've got an entire I don't want

00:35:14,609 --> 00:35:17,770
to say underclass right but we've got a

00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,960
bunch of people who

00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:23,290
don't have a good way to participate in

00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:25,210
the economy that we collectively here

00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:27,700
are all part of because we work in

00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:30,970
technology so IBM that's got a program

00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:34,060
that takes these kids and spend some

00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:36,610
gets him for six years and puts him into

00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:39,040
an intensive program that takes him

00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:41,050
through high school and two years of

00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,910
college and gets what in the u.s. is a

00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:45,490
two-year college degree it's called an

00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:48,910
associate's degree and gives them paid

00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:52,840
apprenticeships in stem in computer

00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:56,350
science in hardware design and helps

00:35:52,840 --> 00:36:00,340
take these kids who are at risk and gets

00:35:56,350 --> 00:36:02,650
them into the modern world so for me

00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:04,810
that's a really exciting thing right and

00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:07,600
I want to be part of that I want the

00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:09,880
ability to do more there so for me

00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,230
that's that's another really fascinating

00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,720
thing that comes out of this acquisition

00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:16,510
and I hope that you guys are excited

00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:19,230
about it as well because I think it's

00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:21,510
all an opportunity for us to do good and

00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:29,020
that matters

00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:36,550
so anyway Fedora Red Hat IBM I think

00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:41,109
it's got promise don't panic cautiously

00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:45,190
optimistic I think there is a way ahead

00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:48,940
and it won't always be smooth and there

00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:51,040
will be bumps in the road right but but

00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:54,480
we'll cope with it change is a good

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,480
thing we can do this

00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:11,359
or who needs coffee yeah now quiz uh

00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:11,359
Steven

00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:21,810
oh that is a great question Stephen

00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:26,340
wants to know how fedora can participate

00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:29,090
in p-tech I don't know yet because we're

00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:31,650
still looking at what that means so

00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:34,500
Alyssa has been working with that side

00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:37,800
of the IBM house dallisa Alexander who

00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,750
is our chief people officer and I need

00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,730
to catch up with her and figure out how

00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:44,490
we can participate but I agree Fedora

00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:46,170
would be a fabulous spot for something

00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:48,210
like that yeah

00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:54,320
believe me I'm gonna figure out a way to

00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:54,320
make the connections yes

00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:22,130
ooh can we host community events in IBM

00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:23,809
offices because they have them all over

00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:26,599
the world in places where Red Hat

00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:29,529
doesn't have offices I think that that

00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:32,839
is an idea with a lot of potential and

00:38:29,529 --> 00:38:35,450
and what we need I think to make that

00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:37,460
happen is to get connected with the IBM

00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:41,029
people who actually work in those

00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:43,219
offices and I don't know yet how we're

00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:45,229
gonna do that but I expect that we're

00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:49,339
gonna over the next year so figure out

00:38:45,229 --> 00:38:51,440
how to do that and then figure out how

00:38:49,339 --> 00:38:53,029
to get those people involved in fedora

00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,089
and some of the other upstreams

00:38:53,029 --> 00:38:58,549
a lot of those offices I would expect

00:38:56,089 --> 00:39:01,700
our sales offices because that's

00:38:58,549 --> 00:39:03,799
typically the way that it goes and our

00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,150
people often if they're in that country

00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:07,190
our work in remote they're working from

00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:09,499
home so we've got to figure out how to

00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:12,410
make those connections and this is you

00:39:09,499 --> 00:39:14,150
know ask me in a year but I'm glad that

00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:19,869
you're thinking about it because that's

00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:19,869
a great idea yes sir

00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:51,630
mm-hmm

00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:15,640
so what is this gonna mean for open

00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:19,990
source generally it let me see if I can

00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:23,500
paraphrase this correctly it feels

00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:26,230
sometimes that open source is exploited

00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:28,030
and that people take advantage of other

00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:30,069
companies take advantage of others

00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:32,920
contributions into the world of open

00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:35,980
source to make a prod product and a

00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:41,190
profit and they don't give back and does

00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:41,190
this relationship change that equation I

00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:52,869
think so there needs to be more

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:55,800
recognition over all that you've got a

00:40:52,869 --> 00:41:00,700
share right I mean I think Ginny said it

00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:03,400
you have to give in order to get and so

00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:05,140
I know that IBM sees that and I know

00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,770
that they contribute in a lot of

00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,869
upstreams

00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:11,260
they talk about ISTE o in kubernetes

00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:13,299
right and they get that if you don't

00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:16,690
contribute then you're viewed as a

00:41:13,299 --> 00:41:22,150
parasite I would say that a lot of other

00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:24,250
companies aren't there yet and in some

00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:27,700
ways it's a management education

00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:30,940
function right you have to see

00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:34,660
open-source as more than a pool of free

00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:37,329
labor it has to be something that you're

00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:38,710
committed to that you recognize how it

00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:44,619
works and you're gonna be a full

00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:46,660
participant in the communities so yeah I

00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:49,839
don't know I mean I think that that's an

00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:51,190
interesting space to watch and it's

00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:57,400
gonna be something that we can maybe

00:41:51,190 --> 00:42:02,549
influence going forward and I don't want

00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,549
to say shame companies into right but

00:42:03,809 --> 00:42:08,920
yeah I mean people you know people

00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:11,589
freeload all the time right and it's

00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:13,510
just it's just sometimes a thing I think

00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:17,470
we just have to try to ourselves make

00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:18,970
sure that we're not doing that and IBM

00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:19,750
from what I've observed is pretty good

00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:22,000
about it

00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:25,120
and Red Hat I hope in the communities

00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:29,370
that we participate in there's also good

00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:32,370
about it but we can always do better

00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:32,370
yeah

00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:40,700
say that again

00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:51,460
hmm so how do we on board new

00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:52,990
contributors from IBM into communities

00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:56,190
where Red Hat already has a big presence

00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:58,690
a lot of times they're already there

00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:00,789
right so you know they work in the

00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:04,930
kernel they work in GCC they're working

00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:06,520
in kubernetes upstreams they actually

00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:08,680
have had people you know you know

00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:11,319
they've been here in fedora right I

00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:17,380
expect that that it's gonna be like

00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:22,990
anybody else the deal is that because we

00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:26,289
are affiliated we have to be neutral so

00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:29,349
we have to treat IBM the way we treat

00:43:26,289 --> 00:43:30,940
other partners and that's gonna be an

00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:34,240
important thing because if we don't do

00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:38,230
that if red hat gives IBM some special

00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:39,160
status then why would Dell want to work

00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:41,280
with us right

00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:44,280
why would Intel want to work with us and

00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,900
so we have to be careful about that

00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,210
however I think that it's important that

00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:52,480
everybody who wants to work in

00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:54,730
open-source have an easy on-ramp that's

00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,109
why I think they asked Fedora page right

00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:58,930
the work that's been done there where's

00:43:56,109 --> 00:44:00,130
Matthew yeah I think that that page the

00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:02,619
improvements that have been made there

00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:04,599
are a really good thing and we want to

00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:08,650
keep so I was telling him we I've gotta

00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:10,839
find him some website help we have a

00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:15,190
plan I don't know if it's clever plan

00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:17,730
but it's a plan but yeah we've got to

00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:20,730
make the on board easier for everybody

00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:20,730
Dennis

00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:33,660
mhm

00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:49,290
hmm yeah so is IBM's R&D team gonna be

00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:50,580
interested in using fedora as the basis

00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:53,010
of some of the new stuff that they're

00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:56,850
working on to come up with their new

00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:59,490
products and yeah honestly I would be

00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:01,890
shocked if they weren't but that's not

00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:04,560
something that we're actively reaching

00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:05,940
out to them to do I think that that's

00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:09,020
gonna be one of those please don't

00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:15,930
overwhelm us but if I you up right

00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:17,670
you're an IBM R&D developer and IBM just

00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:21,300
bought Red Hat what are you gonna go

00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:24,090
look at and we already know right they

00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:26,970
used they used fedora they use ride for

00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:29,910
the power nine bring up right there's

00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:32,220
precedent there I see no reason why that

00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:34,140
would change I don't know how we're

00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:38,990
gonna adapt to quantum computing that's

00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:38,990
gonna be pretty interesting but Matthew

00:45:56,030 --> 00:46:01,960
yes did everybody hear that you want to

00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,960
say that into the mic

00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:22,790
someone from IBM research saw all the

00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:25,970
tweets during the Facebook presentation

00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:28,940
yesterday and commented on Twitter that

00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:30,800
the trajectory fedora at IBM research

00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:33,410
looks kind of the same way the doric

00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,560
going up and then he sent me a very long

00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:38,000
email this morning which I sent Becca

00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:41,540
this looked awesome can't reply talk to

00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,890
you next week but I think we've got a

00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:47,120
lot of possibilities for collaboration

00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:51,110
they're so exciting that's great like

00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:55,300
welcome to the family and it's not gonna

00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:55,300
be a dysfunctional family picnic right I

00:46:56,170 --> 00:47:00,670
say yes in the back yeah

00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:30,500
oh yeah so that's interesting right so

00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:33,960
the comment is that IBM's cloud has

00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:37,500
instances of power and Z out there for

00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:39,330
developers to use to to start working on

00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:41,160
right because of course you got to have

00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:43,770
you get it's no good without the

00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:45,870
applications and so can we have some

00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:48,210
fresh instances can we should we put

00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:52,410
rawhide out there Oh No maybe not yeah

00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:55,140
yeah yeah I think that's a great idea

00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:56,520
and I would I would be shocked if that

00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:58,920
doesn't start happening of its own

00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,510
accord but if it doesn't then I think we

00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:06,800
can reach out and find those folks and

00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:06,800
maybe make that happen yes sir

00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:12,940
[Music]

00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:34,190
so how will fedora build trust in the

00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:36,829
world of the hybrid cloud across

00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:39,260
multiple clouds well you know red hats

00:48:36,829 --> 00:48:42,559
official answer to that is OpenShift

00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:44,690
right and it's the platform for

00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:47,869
deploying and managing and building and

00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:51,589
all your containers and fedora is based

00:48:47,869 --> 00:48:55,270
on core OS and core OS is based on rel

00:48:51,589 --> 00:48:58,369
and og fedora aquarius who would think

00:48:55,270 --> 00:49:01,190
and so i think that that's the path that

00:48:58,369 --> 00:49:03,050
we're gonna take in that world right

00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:04,670
I think Fedora core OS is going to be a

00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:10,490
lot of fun to watch I'm really glad to

00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:13,490
see that that's finally a real thing I'm

00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:14,930
looking forward to more I mean the other

00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:17,450
thing that's gonna be interesting is the

00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:20,500
world of IOT and the edge right and

00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:23,500
fedora is gonna be leading the way there

00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,500
sorry

00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:40,660
is IBM going to invest directly into

00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:44,590
fedoras since red hat is remaining

00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:47,050
independent well they've already

00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:50,350
invested in Fedora over the years

00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:52,600
because you know as as dennis has said

00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:56,680
right they've donated Hardware into the

00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:58,900
build to the build route which is great

00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:00,280
right because otherwise we wouldn't have

00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:02,440
power hardware because we could have

00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:04,480
never afforded it we would have we

00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:08,320
certainly wouldn't have access to Z oh

00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:10,540
my god so I would expect that that level

00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:13,990
would continue and I don't know what

00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:16,300
else they might want to do what I would

00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:18,400
hope for would be more volunteer

00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:21,340
opportunities for some of their really

00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,760
good engineers because as I said they do

00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:26,890
they have some great engineering talent

00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:29,830
they're really impressive and so it's

00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:31,890
it's gonna be interesting to see how

00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:34,180
their people decide to participate

00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:38,350
whether they're gonna show up with a big

00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:40,990
bucket of money you know it would be

00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:43,150
nice but I wouldn't hold my breath

00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:49,170
cuz nobody's got big buckets of money to

00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:49,170
give away for the most part I wish

00:50:54,290 --> 00:51:02,650
anybody else going once going twice

00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:09,489
coffee

00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:09,489
