Title: What can we do for cross-distro collaboration in packaging? - Igor Gnatenko - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-09-02
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	Packages in each distributions are quite different. Why do we actually spend maintainers’ time on dealing with these things? I will go through differences in each ecosystem (Python, Ruby, Rust, …) between Fedora and other closest distributions and then we will discuss and try to find out what ideas are good, bad and figure out plan how to get to the future with same packaging across the world.
