Title: Fedora Flatpaks - Felipe Borges - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-08-28
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	Fedora Silverblue is the next-generation Fedora Workstation that promises painless upgrades, clear separation between the OS and applications, and secure and cross-platform applications. The basic operating system is an immutable OSTree image, and all the applications are Flatpaks.

In this talk we will present the existing infrastructure to create Flatpaks out of Fedora packages, and detail the process of converting a RPM into a Flatpak by demonstrating it live.
