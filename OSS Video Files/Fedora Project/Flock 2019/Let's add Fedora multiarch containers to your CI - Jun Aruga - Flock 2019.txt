Title: Let's add Fedora multiarch containers to your CI - Jun Aruga - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-08-28
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	An introduction about multiarch project [1] to enable users to build, run and test Fedora multi arch (aarch64, 390x and etc) containers on your host architecture x86_64 easily.

Multiarch project is a collection of tools to emulate different architecture containers by QEMU and binfmt_misc and the compatible container images.

I also compare it with similar technologies docker buildx and podman buildx being developed by buildash and podman team.
