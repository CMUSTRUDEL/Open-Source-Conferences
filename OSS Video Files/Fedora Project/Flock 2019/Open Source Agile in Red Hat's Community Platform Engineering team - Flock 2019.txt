Title: Open Source Agile in Red Hat's Community Platform Engineering team - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-09-02
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	Pierre-Yves Chibon, Leigh Griffin

In 2001, the Agile Manifesto, a collection of simple principles for software development, was published. It helped shape how development teams work. Meanwhile, open source has its own set of principles that promote and build community, transparency, and collaboration, and meritocracy. On paper these two sets of principles match closely. But in practice, using Agile in an open source project may make community members wary, especially volunteers.

This is extra challenging for Fedora, since Red Hat sponsors the project and contributes in order to meet business goals. The Community Platform Engineering team has a foot in both the business and open source camps to support Fedora and CentOS. How can we better interact with global volunteers and Red Hat, increase confidence in delivering on important goals, and do it openly and transparently? How do we embrace and not isolate? How do we ensure that we add value? How do we actually function? We are about to embark on an Agile Transformation and we want you to come on this journey with us.

so thanks for everyone for coming you

00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,150
know huge crowd agile been a very

00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:11,710
important topic it flock and so on and

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,360
but what I'm going to talk about over

00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,580
the next 50 minutes or so it probably

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,680
won't last that long and is open source

00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,050
agile and to try and give an overview of

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,880
where the CPE team are going there are a

00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,800
number to CP team here so thanks for

00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,239
coming along for moral support you were

00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,930
in no way force to come to this talk

00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:29,950
blink twice if your captors say so and

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,020
thankfully the cameras facing this way

00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,070
so no one can see that and so this give

00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,140
a little bit of background about myself

00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,390
my name is Lee Griffin and I'm one of

00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,880
the co managers of the CPD team along

00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:42,340
with Jim Perrin here and I joined the

00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,230
team back in January and one of my

00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,670
backgrounds and expertise is in agile

00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,829
transformations I've done this with a

00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:50,920
couple of companies and one team would

00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:53,770
in Red Hat and so I want to give a kinda

00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,110
general overview of Voyage Iowa we want

00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,489
to move in this direction and and try

00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:00,579
and color it with some of the challenges

00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:02,110
that we face within this team the first

00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:04,899
thing I suppose is to define what agile

00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:07,330
is right so agile depending on how it's

00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:10,210
spelt is actually two different words so

00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,920
agile with a lowercase a is quick and

00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,690
well coordinated in movement that is

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,390
something I am not anymore after many

00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:18,610
injuries playing football over the years

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,830
when you see agile with a capital e it

00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:24,040
talks more about the mental soybean

00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:26,010
agile that quick-thinking acuteness

00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,390
awareness and what you're doing and

00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,340
agile with a capital a is all about the

00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:32,049
mindset it's that mindset shift of

00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,990
wanting to continuously innovate

00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:37,119
continuously improve and ultimately

00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,159
break down complex problems and make him

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,570
that little bit simpler so just

00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:43,030
beginning with a definition there

00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:45,909
because marketing terms have ruined the

00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:47,110
word agile and Red Hat plays very large

00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:49,000
part in that talking about agile

00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:52,600
integrations is the wrong kind of agile

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,820
in this context now I'd join for

00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,930
organized teams is really really really

00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:01,360
hard um it is a cultural and a mindset

00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:03,310
shift you were trying to change patterns

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,049
of behavior that have been ingrained in

00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,590
people and teams and products come back

00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:07,479
decades

00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,789
I think Brendan had it on a slide

00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:11,950
yesterday say the agile manifesto was 18

00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:12,569
years old and the devil process in and

00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,030
around red

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:16,680
and rel is going on 20 years or so right

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,480
so you're predating even the standards

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,879
that are driving a lot of the agile

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,989
innovations that are out there now

00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:23,849
here's the thing teams aren't prepared

00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:25,769
for it and they might not want to move

00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:27,359
that way there's a certain set of

00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:29,430
prerequisites before you can actually

00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:31,349
start working in an agile manner so for

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,299
example you need good test beds you need

00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:35,909
good repeatability in your processes and

00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:38,040
you need time you need headspace and you

00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:40,799
need focus right so a lot of teams don't

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,939
actually have that and teams might want

00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:44,310
to move this way why do we want to

00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:46,169
change not everybody embraces change

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:50,040
it's one of the things people fear and

00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:52,949
for very good reasons now I attend a lot

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,599
of outside conferences and if you're to

00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:56,669
believe the conference's and if you're

00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,349
to believe people on Twitter and

00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:59,760
LinkedIn in other places this is easy

00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:01,680
it's choice please sure why can't you do

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,569
it just go and implement scrum hire me

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,549
as a scrum coach give me 200k a year and

00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:06,930
I'll solve all your problems that is one

00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:08,969
of the problems within the industry is

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,840
that kind of model of pain for a quick

00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:14,939
win you don't get a quick win and

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,299
success stories are the biggest problem

00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:20,430
with agile because success stories not

00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:23,129
existing there is no perfect version of

00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,959
agile anybody that says they follow a

00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:26,790
perfect version of agile is lying or

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,530
trying to self promote themselves to get

00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,470
a job as an agile coach I'm in the wrong

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,930
industry I think here and I like to talk

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,669
about the failures in agile and I turn

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,139
up the agile conferences and talk about

00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:39,720
how difficult ads really isn't the

00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:41,790
problems we had and why it didn't work

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,970
and half the room are looking at me

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,930
amazed that agile failed for you and the

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,699
other half is not in their head going

00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,709
yeah we've hit all of those problems

00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,629
we've invented some of her own problems

00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,949
and Red Hat has a certain amount a

00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:55,319
uniqueness to other companies do not

00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:56,489
have as he can imagine but there's a

00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,650
story behind whether it's a pitcher

00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:01,949
airplane here

00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,400
so back in wartime and one side was in

00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:05,159
the war

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,079
konna general came to an airfield and

00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,389
said right we need to win the battle in

00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,039
the air so I'm getting all my engineers

00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:12,419
gonna gather around the table and we're

00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,969
not leaving until we've a plan to go on

00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:17,639
Windows so he said to his engineers on

00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:19,469
this picture of the plane can you please

00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,320
put a door for you have to repair most

00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:23,460
of the damage and the engineers were

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,289
scratching their head and we're looking

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,770
at her putting dots on the fuselage dots

00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:28,229
and the way

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,400
doston to tailor the plane and after a

00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:30,870
couple of minutes are all not in gone

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,539
yet that's that's where most of our work

00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,379
actually is and the general said okay

00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,360
here's the plan

00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:38,190
we're going to put extra armor on the

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,539
fuselage on the wings and on the tail of

00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,069
the plane I were going to go and win

00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:42,419
this war and there was fist bumps and

00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:44,030
whooping and everyone was delighted and

00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:46,440
there was one engineer just said

00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:48,870
respectfully no that's not gonna work

00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:52,169
first we need to put armor on the

00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:53,550
cockpit and on the engines and the

00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:54,720
general said why the hell would we do

00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,639
that all your friends and colleagues

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,099
have said this is where the damage we

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,349
repair us another engineer said they're

00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:03,150
the planes that don't come home so

00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:05,099
they're the stories that we don't hear

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,740
the failures the problems that we hit

00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:09,840
the failures that will not just fracture

00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,690
a team but will kill any agile

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,340
transformation that you're trying to do

00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:17,460
I've seen so many planes not come back

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,930
from initiatives I've led I welcomed

00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,430
failure failure is actually something

00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,590
that you should embrace because it's a

00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,300
chance to learn you know we need to

00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,800
Shepherd failure so that our ship

00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,690
doesn't hit the rocks and completely

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,240
sink but you know getting a leg raise is

00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,919
not a bad thing and this is what a used

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,360
problem I have with agile everyone talks

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,250
about how perfect it is and success

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,900
story should not be believed so that's

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,150
why I'm telling you this is Howard this

00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,060
is gonna be a long journey it's going to

00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:44,550
be fraught with danger and we're gonna

00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,110
question why we're doing it and it's

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:50,279
about sticking with that for the longer

00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:51,529
plan now open-source can never be agile

00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:54,389
can it

00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:56,310
I've seen something only yesterday and

00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:58,380
it said there's actually a law the name

00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,090
escapes me I find it later on that

00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,039
sensational headlines that end in a

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:04,770
question mark or was really to an answer

00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:06,180
of no right so I'm gonna circumvent that

00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,229
law and say the question is actually

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,560
posed wrong

00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:14,819
the problem with agile right now its

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,669
scrum is so ubiquitous that people

00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:19,199
replace the word a little bit scrum oh

00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:20,400
we can't do agile because we can't do

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,349
sprint con and more across three

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,210
different time zones agile doesn't talk

00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,650
about sprint planning all we hate in

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,090
daily stand-ups because we've too many

00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,610
meetings agile doesn't talk about daily

00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:31,169
stand-ups and he can replace Kanban in

00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,550
there as well because Kanban is starting

00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:35,279
to become more scrum like even though

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,659
they're two separate things it's

00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,699
possible your odds with our values we

00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:39,150
got a lot of values for real in open

00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,530
source

00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,780
company and open source team and open

00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,010
source project could be at odds with

00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,650
them I don't know we talked about that

00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:48,300
later and we don't want to have a soil

00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,820
enforced on us because we volunteer

00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,500
that's absolutely true but again you

00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,760
were assuming that we're following scrum

00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,230
and he got a deal sprint plan and a

00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,150
10:00 p.m. at night when the family are

00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:58,770
in bed stay on it for two hours and

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,630
story point everything that is not the

00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,130
case he can do it if you wanted but

00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,840
that's why open source agile hasn't

00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:07,410
worked today's because people try and

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,780
gravitate toward scrum this is the outer

00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:11,190
umbrella it's a very dated picture now

00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,010
there's a lot more buzzwords could be

00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:16,290
added to it the problem with the agile

00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:18,720
umbrella is people gravitate to the

00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:22,020
bottom row they look at scrum they look

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,270
at XP and they look at and even remember

00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,220
RUP they made an agile version of RUP

00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:28,560
which is equally horrible called AOP and

00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:31,830
they look at Kanban and they look at a

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,690
lot of water full frameworks frameworks

00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,460
are fantastic because they give you a

00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,630
set of railroad tracks that once you get

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,190
on you know you're gonna get off at the

00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,050
destination provided you follow the

00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,480
rules of the framework so I take an

00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,130
angular or react or any of those UI

00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,840
frameworks that are going around in

00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:49,230
JavaScript land if you followed our

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,330
framework you will get a UI but we don't

00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:53,310
want a full framework you can go that

00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,870
route for sure but when I talk about

00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,510
agile I talk about the layer above that

00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:00,180
in the umbrella are you capable of doing

00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:02,220
test-driven development are you capable

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,620
of looking at your overall release plan

00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,600
and try to break it down into smaller

00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,920
chunks that help you manage the risk

00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,830
that helps you get features out there

00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:13,770
faster to the community are you able to

00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:16,320
self organize as a team do you actually

00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,970
want early feedback we just released the

00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,010
first version Aroha gate english peer

00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:21,270
spoke about in the last hour we could

00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,290
have wait another three or four months

00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,730
and release in the whole thing and

00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,650
realize we delivered the wrong ting

00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:27,930
we've delivered us now we've got great

00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,250
feedback might not be the feedback we

00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,540
want to hear as developers about his

00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,550
feedback you got to take that the good

00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,960
with the bad

00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:37,680
what I really like about this though is

00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:39,270
the word sustainable pace nobody wants

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,710
to be working 60 hour weeks and doing

00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,300
the heroics to get a release at the

00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:44,880
window this is what agile and the whole

00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,160
mindset actually preaches about that we

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,170
should be maximizing our value in the

00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,880
time that we have and actually

00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,810
delivering stuff early and often to the

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,810
community and here across

00:08:53,950 --> 00:09:00,770
the agile manifesto is now 18 years old

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,590
for those that don't know in 2001 they

00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:05,870
got the leading thinkers in the software

00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:08,000
engineering world brought him to a ski

00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,410
resort they got very drunk for a couple

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,150
of days and they came up with the bottom

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,730
at his chart that's pretty much what

00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:16,720
happened because the reality is software

00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:19,880
is still in its infancy if you take

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:25,010
professions like accountancy for example

00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:27,380
and that is in every religious books or

00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:29,480
texts regardless your Creed accountancy

00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:32,570
is referenced on morinda they have 2000

00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,070
plus years of best practices software

00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,510
best practices kind of started a

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,300
marriage and into the 90s into the early

00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,740
2000s when people got fast internet

00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,360
connections when they actually got

00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,770
laptops and desktops that he could work

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,900
on at home that it wasn't shared

00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:46,340
resources so they had to come together

00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,770
and figure out well how the hell are we

00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,970
gonna build better software and this is

00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,800
what they came up with a set of values

00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,930
or principles which are on the bottom

00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,150
and the interesting thing they talk

00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:58,400
about is it's one over the other but

00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:00,500
that doesn't say we ignore what's on the

00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,570
other side of that so we still like

00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,760
processes and tools we still like having

00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,900
a plan we still like having a contract

00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,150
and getting paid when we're dealing with

00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,340
real customers but we place much more

00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,290
value on dealing with individuals and

00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,210
interactions which is effectively what

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:16,220
the Fedora community is right dealing

00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:18,920
with people every day we want to have

00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,960
small useful pieces of software being

00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,370
released we want to have customer

00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,350
collaboration and remember this was in

00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:26,480
2001 everyone assumed that people were

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,140
paying for software rather than giving

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,940
it away for free

00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,410
all right so customer can be replaced

00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,880
with community or anybody that

00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:34,490
effectively wants to have a say in what

00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:37,780
you're doing and more importantly for me

00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:40,370
responding to change you know I liken am

00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:43,040
an agile methodology versus this

00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,570
waterfall way of taking an old cannon

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,950
and I want to shoot Pierre there in the

00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,540
center right so I want to line up the

00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,100
cannon and Pierre still sitting there

00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,540
and I'm lining it up and I'm saying okay

00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,280
Pierce stay where we are and Elmer want

00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,570
to fire it and don't move when that's

00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,130
going to shoot here please write in

00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,080
Pierre sidesteps with me mr. target

00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:59,210
right that's no good that was the

00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,620
original plan to kill Pierre so now

00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,150
we're going to take a laser guided

00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,950
missile will fire it and wherever Pierre

00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,270
goes will hopefully hit him right that's

00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:15,560
what agile talks that

00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:18,470
sorry Pierre hey char out here we're

00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,730
okay so how does all this align right so

00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,930
that's a little bit of history about

00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,930
what our oil is and where we're trying

00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:26,240
to go write the value alignment is

00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:28,940
actually there we just probably don't

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,010
Rize realize it the last thing you want

00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,510
is a difference in value alignment

00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,680
because once I think you're burned in a

00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,360
bridge jitters I think you're building

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,100
the tunnel this is what happens when

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,600
engineers in Kiwi don't talk by the way

00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,700
in most products and so on you get that

00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,320
difference of opinion on it but you look

00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,209
at the values particularly for Red Hat

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,790
and I'm using scrum because they have

00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:48,649
actually pointed values versus the agile

00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,810
manifesto which has these broad sweeping

00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:53,830
and statements out there and it already

00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:55,700
talks about things like commitment and

00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:57,740
accountability and those words are

00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,300
almost air word-for-word in US but you

00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,380
look at open source comms value

00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,510
statements about open exchange

00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,870
participation rapid prototyping is

00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:08,060
pretty much the definition of agile

00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,800
meritocracy in community those words and

00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,810
values echo across all of it which for

00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,300
me when I went to join Red Hat as a

00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,980
company it actually aligned with the

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,600
value statements I had from working as a

00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,120
scrum master and scrum coach prior to

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,920
that so I really really liked the value

00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,839
alignment going through it and when we

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,050
start talking about agile in the context

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,120
of the words and context I used earlier

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,649
bringing that into an open source

00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,930
community like fedora should be very

00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:34,130
easy and should be welcomed because at

00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,990
the end of it all we're trying to add

00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:38,510
value we're trying to do it in a very

00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:40,070
open way and we're trying to allow more

00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,649
people participate in exchange

00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:44,390
information and that's really what our

00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:48,740
transformation in CP is going to be

00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:51,230
about now agile is all about teamwork

00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,940
but it's that continuous integration

00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:55,910
kind of chain where we want to

00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:58,220
continuously plan innovate deliver and

00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:00,529
improve on what we're doing now that

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,240
mindset should not be a mindset that we

00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,740
associate with agile all good engineers

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,279
and all good engineering teams should

00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:08,959
strive to troye some of these things we

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,940
do want to have a plan so that we can

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,890
let people know when to expect things we

00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,779
do want to continuously improve and

00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:16,820
iterate on that plan we want to have

00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:18,089
systems that are integrated so that we

00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,249
can open them to

00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:22,170
he allow more self-serve opportunities

00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:23,910
in there with the knowledge that you

00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,730
can't break too many things right so

00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:28,620
this is all good team practices and

00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,779
these are practices that our team CP

00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,809
want to try and embrace I want to try

00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:36,120
and bring forward with them but we need

00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:37,709
to do it together right this is not me

00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,089
going off on my own deciding we're going

00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:40,350
to do an agile transformation or the

00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:42,240
team going off doing it and doing it in

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,620
isolation and say hey like it or lump

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,660
but this is exactly how we're going to

00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,519
work with you that is not the case we've

00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:50,249
already issued a lot of blog posts about

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,860
it we're opening a Friday with infra and

00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:54,600
which McHale posted only yesterday I

00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,399
think to try and open her doors and get

00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,430
people to come in and talk to us and

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:02,069
tell us how you want to work with us and

00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:04,379
how we want to work with you and we are

00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:05,790
identifying our stakeholders which in

00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:07,379
fairness is every single community

00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,569
member is a stakeholder we will take

00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:11,399
people's view seriously because red hat

00:14:09,569 --> 00:14:13,800
is a meritocracy and that is the

00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,170
definition of the meritocracy we want to

00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,569
involve them and we want to stakeholders

00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:20,459
to express their needs what do you want

00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:22,350
why do you want to maybe win right

00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:25,019
because sent in howard dayton in the

00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:26,220
sand can be a little bit complicated

00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:28,350
because there's obviously other

00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,699
initiatives and things going on but work

00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,740
with us you know work with us on a

00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:33,449
compromise work with us on a plan how

00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,740
can we break that plan down into smaller

00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:38,670
bite-sized chunks that give you that

00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,809
value when you want it so one of the

00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,800
first things we brought in is a

00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:45,990
requirements gate for the CPE team and

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,970
this is to stop the long arm of the law

00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,379
reaching over IRC and tip and someone on

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,670
the shoulder and say hey can you spend

00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:52,139
the next week or two working on this

00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,209
because it's really important to me and

00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:57,929
do not in a vacuum and doing it in

00:14:54,209 --> 00:15:00,209
isolation we want minimal information so

00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:02,699
this gate should not be too tall to get

00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:03,839
over it should be minimal so what is the

00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:05,670
scope of what you're trying to achieve

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,559
tell me what it is why are we trying to

00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:10,290
do it what's the kind of value output of

00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:11,670
this and what apps are involved right

00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:14,610
because we need to take that information

00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,149
bring it in as a team and talk about it

00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,980
as a team

00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:19,019
so we don't want to talk about it as

00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,790
soil or individuals anymore because that

00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:22,579
is a problem that we've had and I speak

00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,959
of it out in a couple of minutes as well

00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:27,899
but we want you involved in the process

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,689
we don't want the application requests

00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:31,800
thrown over a figurative wall and then

00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:33,450
you ask us six months later

00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,640
where it is right that's not what we

00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:37,019
want we want you involved we want you to

00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,149
work with us work as true to

00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:41,580
requirements help us understand what it

00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:44,010
is that you want from our team and from

00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:46,140
this piece of functionality and we want

00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:48,060
this fair to everyone right we don't

00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:50,040
want ting sneaking through the gate like

00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:52,079
the cat was trying to do there on it we

00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,860
don't want that right we want to make

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:58,620
sure that even our own team CPE are held

00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,180
accountable to those measures so any

00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,890
initiative we're trying to drive for

00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,600
self-improvement and organization will

00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:05,339
be backed by your requirement spec and

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,410
those specs right now are living on the

00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:09,269
wiki so they're completely open people

00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:11,519
can come in get involved make edits

00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:13,620
comment on it we will have ultimately a

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,510
better forum for that where people can

00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,279
participate and communicate but we're

00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,720
doing this openly because we want to do

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,470
it openly that's our way that's our

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,899
Creed that's our mantra now here's the

00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:27,480
thing everybody wants something right so

00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:28,110
our team represents both fedora and

00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,329
CentOS

00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:32,579
we're also paid by Red Hat as a company

00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:33,870
they might want something rel might want

00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:36,240
something Fedora might want something

00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,800
centers might want something the team

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,320
themselves might want to do something

00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:43,290
because believe it or not we have a lot

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,360
of good ideas within our team M&D is for

00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:48,060
improvement for scalability for

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,880
performance things that might not matter

00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,360
to you the end consumer until you really

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,740
need them

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,630
so when you're build or compose has

00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,220
taken 18 hours instead of 18 minutes

00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:59,430
that's when it becomes a problem

00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:02,070
so like that everybody wants something

00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:04,559
so we have to come up with a means of

00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:05,790
value driven planning to assess all of

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,550
those options and all of those

00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:10,860
opportunities and the reality is we

00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:14,459
refine I team we're about 18 to 20

00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:16,770
people and we have a mix of

00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,720
responsibilities from an infrastructure

00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,250
side we're maintaining hardware that's

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,860
over at ELLs in physical and virtual

00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,959
machines to a services side that's over

00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:28,199
a hundred services that we're

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,600
maintaining our team is very small that

00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,580
footprint is very big that means we're

00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,890
gonna disappoint treat the forward all

00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,480
stakeholders at any given time because

00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,640
we can't move those things in parallel

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,770
not at the quality we want not at the

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,130
resiliency we want and not at the long

00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:46,810
term maintenance footprint that we want

00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:49,210
so we're trying to maximize our value

00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:51,310
because we are snickered like that we

00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:55,030
have minimal resources in minimal time

00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:58,210
and our mission should be to provide the

00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:01,120
most value for our time deliver the most

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:04,120
value for fedora as a project as well as

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,430
our other stakeholders we're gonna have

00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:10,300
a high priority queue that will be

00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:11,830
regularly reviewed and iterated on items

00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,510
near the top will be much more granular

00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,670
so that we're able to break it down a

00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17,440
little bit more fully understand what it

00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:21,330
is talk about when we can hot drop

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:24,310
versions of it staged releases and so on

00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:26,440
items near the bottom are things we want

00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:28,690
to do we know they're important

00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,400
we're not dismissing them but we need to

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,840
spend more time on them in the future to

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,870
get into that level of granularity that

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,540
we need de ting would having what we

00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:39,730
call a backlog like this is there as a

00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:41,710
firm commitment if something lands on

00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:45,310
the backlog and stays on the backlog

00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:46,840
that we will do it and that's important

00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:49,330
right because we need to review that

00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,070
backlog periodically and if we can't do

00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,730
it for whatever reason we should be

00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:56,230
telling you that to set expectations

00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,670
because again you might log a ticket and

00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,410
then wonder six months later why it's

00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:01,690
not done while it's still sitting on the

00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,550
backlog there will be an expectation on

00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,680
you to keep annoying us or annoying your

00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:07,900
friendly Fedora representative and match

00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,700
you and others to say why this is hugely

00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:13,260
important to you and the community as a

00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:16,540
whole so we will have a constant

00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:19,120
transparent prioritized queue of work

00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,860
defeat office so you should know at any

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,960
given time where your request is in that

00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,190
and you'll know how to try and influence

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,690
and work with us to get that request

00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:30,850
further up the line now where the hell

00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:34,470
do we start right as a lot of things any

00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,470
questions before I move on

00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:48,379
so we will talk in a very mature way

00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:51,649
with the stakeholders here Mina oh sorry

00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:53,629
I'm so consensus is a very overloaded

00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:57,139
word what do we mean by consensus

00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:59,179
paraphrasing and what I mean by that is

00:19:57,139 --> 00:20:00,529
having an adult conversation with the

00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:02,570
stakeholders involved so the

00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:04,460
stakeholders will be a representative

00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:06,830
from the Santos project a representative

00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,509
from the Fedora project and possibly

00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,220
representative from Red Hat we don't

00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:13,100
know how much of a say they want in her

00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:15,350
work right now none thankfully and also

00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:18,019
the team are representing themselves you

00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:19,490
know we're here with ideas that we would

00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:22,039
hope other stakeholders would listen to

00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:23,840
you know when a very smart engineer

00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:24,950
tells you that if we don't address this

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,480
the whole system is going to fall over

00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,830
until one's time we should probably be

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,889
paying attention to something like that

00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:34,549
so consensus needs to be among friends

00:20:30,889 --> 00:20:37,730
have a critical look at what the asks

00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:39,470
our do some horse trading and try and

00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:42,230
figure out where the best value for our

00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:43,519
time is right now will that lead to

00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:45,169
kicking and screaming and arguments

00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,809
possibly will we walk away as friends

00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:49,610
hopefully but this is all about

00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:52,039
transparency in how we do that our

00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:53,749
intention and it's going to something

00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:57,200
Matt you mentioned on the first day in

00:20:53,749 --> 00:20:58,820
in his keynote and is to have CTE up on

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,320
the priority list that then is going to

00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,029
send out every week so we're giving a

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,619
constant update about what we're doing

00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:05,629
why we're doing it and if there's

00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:09,590
movements in priority the community will

00:21:05,629 --> 00:21:11,539
know now ultimately we cannot open a

00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:14,149
priority discussion to the whole world

00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:16,789
maybe we can we can discuss that in the

00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:18,830
future but we pretty much want one voice

00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:20,419
to represent our wider group and leave

00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:23,299
that voice potentially open it to the

00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:25,789
world that's to avoid 50 60 or 500 or

00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:28,059
600 opinions coming in and not getting

00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:28,059
anywhere

00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,820
yeah okay so for the benefited are

00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:08,730
recording and folks at the back of the

00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:11,310
room and the fedora priorities will

00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:13,050
filter through council right so get on

00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:14,610
to your friendly council representative

00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:16,380
get on to the council meetings accounts

00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:18,480
a list to try and bubble up high-level

00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,430
concerns obviously at the very very

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,110
granular level you don't need to go to

00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:23,730
your council with that the CPE team are

00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:26,040
open we have a lot of open meetings were

00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:28,740
available for questions comments

00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:31,140
concerns and so on and it just stops and

00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:34,790
Matt you being you know even throw it

00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,790
with information like that

00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,400
yeah and just again to summarize that

00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:09,720
you know talk with your fellow

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,850
stakeholders because this will be

00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,919
transparent each initiative for us will

00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,780
have a singular point of contact again

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,669
just to avoid that looming comes kind of

00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:19,110
scenario so if you do find yourself

00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:20,909
further down the tree for whatever

00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,559
reason have a chat this is where

00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:24,090
horse-trading and you know among friends

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,169
can come in scratch your back you

00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:27,169
scratch mine kind of thing

00:23:54,090 --> 00:24:00,940
yeah yeah so much it was correctly

00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:02,320
saying that when in fedora is important

00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,909
because they're time sensitive there's

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,820
key dates there's releases and so on

00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:08,740
from our side when is something we

00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:11,110
definitely want to know but when that

00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,700
when becomes a mandate and a line in the

00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:14,529
sand we can't cross that's when the

00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,450
whole priority queue can get turned on

00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:18,010
its head and once everybody is aware

00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,450
that this is now the most important

00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:21,100
thing we're working on and all of those

00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:23,080
other things that we were working on

00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:25,600
have now been bumped down the queue that

00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:28,149
is perfectly fine but when for some

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,130
people can get translated into a firm

00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:33,870
commitment versus their I would like

00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:33,870
this in this release or this timeframe

00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:44,279
yeah I'm yeah and that should then

00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,419
become a higher priority because of the

00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:52,059
mission-critical and the time nature of

00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:53,559
it yeah okay so where do we start the

00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:56,679
first thing we've actually done as a

00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:58,419
team was understand or rimas that word

00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:59,740
cloud you see there was taken from a

00:24:58,419 --> 00:25:02,080
spreadsheet that had a hundred and

00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:05,320
twelve line items on it which each

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:08,440
represented a service or a ting that we

00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,809
owned or we're responsible for some of

00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,210
those things were Fedora infrastructure

00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:14,679
as Warren Lyon which is probably backed

00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:17,649
by a couple of tails and tickets and

00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:19,539
over a thousand VMs one line was rail

00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:22,419
ends which again is backed by an equal

00:25:19,539 --> 00:25:24,460
number of huge tickets and so on some of

00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:27,610
them are code bases as big as pody body

00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:29,440
and pig or which probably need eight to

00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:31,240
ten Engineers each to realize their full

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,000
potential and so on somebody's are

00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,850
really really small footprint items but

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,799
everyone at em for better or worse the

00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:41,919
cpe team has been designated as the

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:43,539
maintainer of I don't know the full

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,700
history that ye we ended up with a lot

00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:47,440
of em sometimes it's because we stepped

00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:50,140
in sometimes it's because we volunteered

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,880
sometimes because we were voluntold it

00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:54,279
doesn't matter right now we're deemed as

00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,559
the main maintainer of them and also

00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:59,020
understanding that can help other

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:02,280
stakeholders realize why we can't do

00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,280
things as fast as they might want

00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,820
the second thing we done was to find her

00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:08,680
mission and I was really happy to hear

00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,870
that the second speaker yesterday talked

00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:12,580
about missions and strategy and the need

00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:14,860
to have that statement and it becomes a

00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,300
funnel for me it also becomes like a

00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,130
lighthouse in the dark that you can

00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,570
figure out exactly where you are and

00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:21,340
have a kind of TrueNorth when you have a

00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:22,630
question or a problem now I'm not going

00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,910
to read that word forward because I went

00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:27,610
down on the blog but effectively we have

00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:30,760
to take a real look at what the mission

00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:33,900
statement for our team is to allow us

00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:36,490
legitimate lycée no two-way requests

00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,500
that does not mean NOAA's our default

00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:41,140
answer it means you as the requester

00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,340
should expect no to be an answer if

00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,230
you're asking for something that's

00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,060
outside of this remit there are of

00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:49,300
course exceptions we will listen we're

00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:51,790
not heartless cold human beings we will

00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,620
take every request seriously but it

00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:55,810
gives us that level of protection and

00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:59,260
also allows us address the huge

00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:00,850
footprint that we have which is what our

00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,320
next phase is at the moment which we

00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:05,170
pretty much kick-started in the last

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,970
week or so and this needs to be

00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:09,040
important because and I love this quote

00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:10,510
there's nothing quite so useless as

00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,790
dealing with great efficiency something

00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:14,710
that should not be done at all so the

00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:16,150
view is that we should probably own all

00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:17,650
of these things for eternity so why the

00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,850
hell are we trimming them when in you

00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:21,400
know six months time they'll all come

00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:23,980
back in first right that's just us waste

00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,170
and time and it's not efficient but we

00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,640
need to gracefully step away from these

00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:29,500
things we're not going to do a mic drop

00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,270
and walk out of the room and say hey

00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,070
we're done with this app so we've

00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:34,990
engaged with fedora council we've

00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:38,170
kick-started a blog post we've opened at

00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:40,240
read on and devil announced and we want

00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:43,240
to let people know why you were stepping

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:48,660
away from it what our plan our for those

00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,660
applications and how you can help us

00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:57,460
so I think part of what's happening here

00:27:55,059 --> 00:28:00,910
is not just an agile transformation in

00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:02,559
the team but that historically this team

00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:04,870
was kind of thought of us the Fedora

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:07,330
team and then maybe a little bit the

00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:10,540
Fedora engineering team but this is a

00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:12,700
specific intentional narrowing of the

00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:15,520
mission of the team to focus on this

00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:18,040
platform enablement mission and that's

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,620
part of why some of the things that the

00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,390
team owns seem very out of scope with

00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:24,880
the mission and now it's easy to look at

00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:26,440
them and say what's this crazy badges

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,850
thing that has nothing to do with what

00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,929
we do why are we doing it this is

00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:32,830
something that shouldn't be done at all

00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:35,860
but when those things were were created

00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:37,090
you know by the team they were part of

00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,370
the scope of the mission so I think it's

00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:42,549
really I don't think this is necessarily

00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:45,190
bad in fact I think it's going to get us

00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:47,880
to a good place but it is a difficult

00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:50,470
transition because it is a very specific

00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,030
intentional narrowing of the scope of

00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:54,340
this team which I think will enable

00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:56,110
everybody to be less stressed out less

00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,700
burned out more efficient and get think

00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:59,860
more things done and there's a lot of

00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:02,230
good outcomes but we should go into that

00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:04,990
really aware of what's happening and

00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:06,549
then you know it's left to a lot of the

00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:08,320
rest of us to figure out what that means

00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:11,470
for the rest of the project which we

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,270
should be aware of - and really just to

00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:14,470
echo it out I suppose like we're not

00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:18,660
doing this for the fun of us right this

00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:20,980
is literally a necessity to allow us

00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:23,500
unblock ourselves and actually start

00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:26,169
adding value to the wider ecosystem and

00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:28,600
having more targeted it bloomed and grew

00:29:26,169 --> 00:29:30,700
over the years organically I don't think

00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,410
anybody took these applications on for

00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,929
the wrong reasons they were all for the

00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:36,610
right reasons and what we're saying is

00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:39,160
that we still value some of these apps

00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:41,620
is just we cannot commit to owning them

00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:44,110
from a maintenance perspective from a

00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:45,970
backlog perspective and from adding new

00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,830
features and so on so that's what we're

00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:49,570
trying to avoid with it let me jump back

00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:54,220
up here so that camera can pick me up

00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:56,470
easier and so our step-back strategy

00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:59,080
right which from a timeline perspective

00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:01,030
is not going to say we're doing all this

00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,830
in 30 days some of these apps could be

00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:04,510
here in six months nine months twelve

00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,760
months time we've said a kind of upper

00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,800
limb

00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:09,050
of about a year to give us enough time

00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:11,330
to help identifying new maintain errs

00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:14,660
new contributors to help on board them

00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:17,270
in some cases me we as a team might need

00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:18,830
to do some work to help enable them get

00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:20,600
that level of access or the level of

00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:23,120
features and functionality that allows

00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,820
us become more self-serve so we've had

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,740
four kind of designations for this the

00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:29,720
forces things stay the same because this

00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,430
is so critical that of all says the CP

00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,020
team step away from it the Fedora

00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:34,760
project could ground to a halt so we

00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:38,420
continue to own it maintain it host it

00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,700
and love it the second one is we'll try

00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:42,470
and host it and we'll do our absolute

00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,360
level best to keep it alive so we go in

00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:46,760
we'll try and do restarts will try and

00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,260
hotfix something because if this goes

00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,620
down it's going to cause problems but

00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:53,300
ultimately another team or another and

00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,890
contributor actually codes against that

00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,020
they develop the fixes they develop the

00:30:54,890 --> 00:31:00,290
features we just happily host it for

00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:02,090
them the third one is you the community

00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:05,210
will own this so this is where the likes

00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:06,890
of badges write which is very important

00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:09,110
from a community growth perspective but

00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:10,700
not so important from a CP perspective

00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:12,980
that we start developing against and

00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:15,350
keeping it alive every day and we throw

00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:17,000
Kevin and I are after putting together

00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:18,500
an open shift instance where we're happy

00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,550
to host it for you we provide power and

00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,550
thing not you

00:31:43,429 --> 00:31:51,649
correct so just to clarify yes CPE CP

00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:53,479
our part of the community they always

00:31:51,649 --> 00:31:55,399
will be part of the community but the

00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:57,440
remit of our team within the community

00:31:55,399 --> 00:31:59,710
is now changing based on this kind of

00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,710
strategy

00:31:59,739 --> 00:32:06,799
sure and the last designation we're

00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,769
looking to retire this application okay

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,599
so some applications are on life support

00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:14,320
are hanging around with no users it's

00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:16,789
occupying head spaces occupying power

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,830
we're just going to retire them the

00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:20,779
thing is anything we do here is not an

00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:25,129
RM minus RF and we're new candy codebase

00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:28,009
and it's gone forever more yes sometimes

00:32:25,129 --> 00:32:29,749
it should be and but we will work with

00:32:28,009 --> 00:32:32,869
the community and like I said we get

00:32:29,749 --> 00:32:34,339
things wrong we will fail we can change

00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:37,219
your mind you can convince us that this

00:32:34,339 --> 00:32:39,169
is the wrong approach so if you do

00:32:37,219 --> 00:32:40,789
disagree with an application or a

00:32:39,169 --> 00:32:41,349
strategy that we've put up we want to

00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:43,339
hear from you

00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:44,869
because we're in the middle of a desert

00:32:43,339 --> 00:32:46,129
and the only way out is to start walking

00:32:44,869 --> 00:32:48,169
and we picked the direction and we've

00:32:46,129 --> 00:32:52,099
started walking and we might get that

00:32:48,169 --> 00:32:53,509
wrong and we want our feedback another

00:32:52,099 --> 00:32:55,129
thing we're starting to do and think

00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:58,219
about what in the teens is defining

00:32:55,129 --> 00:32:59,479
ready and done we need to know when

00:32:58,219 --> 00:33:00,559
we're ready to actually start working on

00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:02,089
something so this is where that

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,109
requirements gate is going to come into

00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:05,330
it this is where stakeholder

00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:07,639
identification this is where we prep the

00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:10,729
team so no longer is it a silo of an

00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:12,739
individual with that 112 app footprint

00:33:10,729 --> 00:33:14,450
that we have where each individual and

00:33:12,739 --> 00:33:16,929
her team owns in excess of ten

00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:20,779
applications we want a team to own them

00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:21,859
for various reasons from redundancy to

00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:23,509
knowledge share and to bring in

00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:25,639
different skills and perspectives to us

00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:27,889
we want the team to be formed and ready

00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:29,599
to go we want this to be prioritized and

00:33:27,889 --> 00:33:31,330
ensure that this is the most important

00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:33,309
thing that we get to work on right now

00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:35,389
and we want to work on us

00:33:33,309 --> 00:33:37,519
but more importantly we want to know

00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:39,469
when we're done two of the biggest

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,659
problems engineering teams face is over

00:33:39,469 --> 00:33:43,279
engineer in a solution or under engineer

00:33:41,659 --> 00:33:45,109
in a solution so we're going to do

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,539
things like acceptance criteria to make

00:33:45,109 --> 00:33:49,609
sure whomever has requested it has told

00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:51,829
us in advance that when you achieve a B

00:33:49,609 --> 00:33:53,719
and C you know you're done because the

00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:56,620
one thing we wanted to do and really get

00:33:53,719 --> 00:33:59,230
into that habit of is to stop starting

00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:01,090
and start finishing so we want to stop

00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:03,400
starting a load of new initiatives and

00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:05,500
just start getting things done getting

00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:11,020
things to the community getting things

00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:13,810
finished and I had a slide about the MVP

00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:15,820
the Minimum Viable Product and and

00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:18,010
Clement sent around a great blog post

00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:20,830
which reminded me the earliest testable

00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:22,600
product and there is a distinction here

00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:23,590
right so we want to try and get

00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,810
something in the hands of the community

00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:27,760
that's usable so if you go and request a

00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:29,440
cour and this is the great analogy to

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,419
use here and why do you want to cower

00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,460
well I want to get from A to B faster I

00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:36,040
want to have air conditioning I want a

00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:39,669
nice radio comfortable leather seats and

00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:41,470
it needs to look good right so me giving

00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:43,330
you a toy after the first two weeks of

00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:44,679
working is no good to you until weeks

00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,879
later and you get a second tire and

00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:47,200
maybe a chassis and then you start

00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:49,240
getting the body of the cow and so on

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,980
your first iteration might be a

00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,940
skateboard it's going to get you faster

00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:55,510
from eight the beam you're getting free

00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:57,220
air conditioner right it's usable you

00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,180
can test it and scratch your head and go

00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,590
what a way to head a little have a

00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,150
skateboard us nowhere near what I want

00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:03,460
it but it's starting to serve a purpose

00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:05,290
and then you waiter aid on doubting you

00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:07,110
might add and you know a steering wheel

00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:09,190
or making it into an electric scooter or

00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:10,450
bicycle or a motorbike and you know

00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:13,000
tendonitis she starts getting silly

00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:15,190
right but you effectively want to build

00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,800
on it and not discard the prior

00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:20,020
prototypes you want to use them and try

00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,700
and carry as much forward as he can but

00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:24,010
not be afraid to try something and get

00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,510
it wrong get a neuron early is fantastic

00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:27,490
we've learned something and we move

00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:29,110
forward with it so this is the approach

00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:30,880
we want to take the earliest testable

00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:32,770
product and we will advertise and

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,090
release note that this is not perfect

00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,320
there is one of the bugs there's going

00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:37,480
to be problems it's not what you've

00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,130
asked for but it's enough for you to

00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:43,450
play with it and enough for you to get

00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:46,840
some value out of it now where are we

00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:51,550
going to next one tracker to rule them

00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:55,330
all okay so we have tiger there's JIRA

00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:58,240
instances there's Kid Hauppauge or get

00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:59,740
lab 400 other ways to do net we can I

00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,350
joke yesterday and say we can get a

00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,580
whiteboard and get a camera and hook it

00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:06,520
up to a permanently and we'll have that

00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:10,120
as a tracker right why do we want a

00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:11,950
tracker the big one for me as a team

00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:14,410
a tracker is usually important because

00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:16,390
it gives you metrics you should not make

00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:19,030
decisions on a gut instinct it should be

00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:21,160
based on good historical data it allows

00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:23,470
us plan better it allows us to self

00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,090
improve as a team so for example if our

00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:27,640
tracker is shown that we're getting a

00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:29,530
huge spike in activity in bogs every

00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,990
single Thursday between midday and you

00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:34,090
know 2 or 3 p.m. that should be enough

00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:35,800
for us to start spotting a trend and say

00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:38,080
we need to examine this we need to

00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:40,660
increase our observability or our

00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:42,610
logging or resiliency or if that's an

00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:44,170
open shift let's add an extra pod and

00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:46,750
start scaling it out and setting

00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:48,130
specific rules up we can't get that if

00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,900
that's fragmented everywhere or if

00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:53,410
that's in one person's head are not

00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:54,850
actually logged in a tracker trackers

00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:57,370
also help the community know what's

00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:59,080
going on so we want you to know what our

00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:02,020
priority queue is we want you to know

00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:04,480
and we are your bogies what the status

00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:05,770
of it is we want your input and because

00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,170
this is a community we want your

00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:10,960
assistance because again small team huge

00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:13,270
footprint if we can enable you land a

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,370
bug or Lander a PR change we're happy to

00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:17,140
do that and help so we need to figure

00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:19,450
out a tracker issue and make that

00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:23,530
visible and make it hook able into all

00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:25,270
of our other sources of information and

00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:27,070
we want to do this openly right sort of

00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:28,780
the tree pillars of empiricism which

00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:30,040
scrum is actually based upon what I

00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,780
snips grow there at the top of the

00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,950
picture because this is not a talk about

00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:35,820
stroma to talk about agile

00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:39,670
that talks about transparency and

00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:41,410
adaptability and inspection so we want

00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:43,660
to inspect what we're doing we want to

00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:46,030
see what the problems are we want to

00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,500
figure out what areas we can adopt we

00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,670
want to take one or two of those changes

00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,560
because if you try and change 10 things

00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:52,360
at once and flip a table you don't know

00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,530
which change is actually taking effect

00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,480
you don't know if changes have

00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:57,190
conflicted against each other and we

00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,750
want to deal with transparently so what

00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:00,270
we're going to tell our team and tell

00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:02,500
our management chain and tell our

00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,910
stakeholders should be the same message

00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,230
we're not going to send one message and

00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:07,570
dress it up for different groups and so

00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:09,880
on and because we're gonna do or do this

00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:11,110
in the open you get to be involved with

00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,910
it as well you get to be a stakeholder

00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:14,980
and see what we're doing and why we're

00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:16,840
trying to do it and possibly tell us not

00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:18,460
as a horrible idea don't do it because

00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,470
you've done it before or seen it and

00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:22,780
seen the implications and we want to

00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:25,480
learn from that

00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:27,310
and we are forming teams within the CPE

00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,980
team were moving away from this siloed

00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:32,950
individual way of working by sharing

00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:35,350
knowledge roja gating and Bodi was our

00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:37,530
first real team and we've had our first

00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:40,540
real success without release recently

00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:42,400
teams work working in silos is a

00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:44,860
horrible for so many reasons for the

00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,680
team and we don't want that as managers

00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:50,410
and we don't want that as human beings

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,480
people are social creatures by nature

00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:56,110
and working in teams helps accelerate

00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,600
everyone's abilities and similarly for

00:38:56,110 --> 00:39:00,550
the community dealing with an already

00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,200
overworked individual who's working in a

00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:03,730
silo and you're adding a request to that

00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,680
it's easy to get lost

00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:08,170
that request can just get sucked into a

00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,900
vacuum in a black hole and disappear at

00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:13,330
least going into a team there's a higher

00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:15,100
chance not a perfect chance that it will

00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:16,630
be picked up right but more people have

00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,640
an opportunity to see it and going back

00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:21,370
to the transparency aspect and a tracker

00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,570
aspect it's there and it's visible and

00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:26,770
it becomes a hell of a lot easier to

00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:31,480
action and here's the thing trials and

00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:32,950
tribulations await us and the dictionary

00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,570
definition for those who are non-english

00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:36,130
speakers a might inherit of that but I

00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:37,350
think Peter Robinson used in one of his

00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:39,400
titles so it's cool

00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:41,530
troubles and events that cause suffering

00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,330
this is gonna be hard on the team there

00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:46,360
is no doubt about this this is again

00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:48,810
changing a way of working making people

00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:51,310
and more self-aware of their actions

00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:52,630
making people aware of problems that

00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:54,820
they've caused inadvertently or

00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:56,200
deliberately who knows right and this is

00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:58,150
gonna be tougher stuff on the team it's

00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,830
gonna be tough on the community and this

00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:01,560
is what's gonna be in front of us it's

00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:04,540
gonna be a hard couple of months as we

00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:06,880
adjusted this style of working as we hit

00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,530
hiccups and road bumps and we're gonna

00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,660
get it wrong and we're gonna get it

00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:13,300
badly wrong and the one thing I would

00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:15,130
ask for his patience I know that we're

00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:17,170
doing this for the right reasons know

00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:19,330
that we're doing it because we love

00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:21,850
fedora that we love the community and

00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:24,160
that we want to try and add more value

00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:25,930
to that than the current value that

00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,350
we're adding which is very scattered at

00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:31,270
the moment and this is a journey for

00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:32,740
those familiar with business and

00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:34,690
economics there's this model called the

00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:36,170
J curve effect or that the satire change

00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:39,590
curve which looks

00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:41,480
and basically people assumed ah hey hol

00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:43,160
it's easy we're gonna just jump from our

00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:46,040
current state to our desired state in a

00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:48,440
very you know simple manner we are going

00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:51,260
to get worse before we get better we

00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,970
have to drop applications gracefully and

00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:55,460
step away from that footprint we have

00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:57,230
that's gonna drop us that's gonna drop

00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,119
our performance or output that's gonna

00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:01,490
cause a lot of heartache it's gonna

00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,930
cause the team to feed overwhelmed and

00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:04,119
it's gonna cause the team to feel a bit

00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:06,619
of despair

00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:08,450
that's when most teams actually give up

00:41:06,619 --> 00:41:11,330
on an agile transformation when you're

00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:12,890
at the bottom at our curve because more

00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:15,260
often than not you're in the satire one

00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:16,700
on the right which is oscillate and you

00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,590
have good days and bad days good days

00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,880
and bad days and it's very hard to know

00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:21,980
when you've come out the other side of

00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:29,000
it without metrics how do you know we're

00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:31,790
a better team we're in an oscillating

00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,450
part on the car right now so in reality

00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:37,430
right the transformation has begun the

00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:39,080
ideas have been socialized the team want

00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:41,480
to move in this direction we've involved

00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:44,420
a community we are deliberately going

00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,369
slower then an enterprise team and I use

00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:48,710
that in air quotes would go because we

00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:50,900
have a lot more footprint we're on a lot

00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:52,820
more critical path and we have a

00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:55,880
moveable release dates with the likes of

00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:57,380
the the fedora EFT or TF 31 F 32 all

00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,530
well-advertised let me know what's gonna

00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:02,630
happen right so we are in dip

00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:05,599
how far down who knows right because

00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:07,580
this is an imaginary model that we have

00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,380
on this here but we are gonna have good

00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,730
we are going to have good days and we

00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:12,170
are going to have bad days with it

00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:14,720
and that's going to translate into weeks

00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:16,430
and months but the reality is by the

00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,290
time we were out flock this time next

00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:20,240
year we should have seen massive

00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:22,280
improvements in the team the average

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:26,210
duration of an agile transformation is

00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:28,940
12 to 18 months and we're maybe three or

00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:32,570
four months into that so we still have a

00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:35,030
long way to go on it now get involved

00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:37,490
right so again we welcome involvement

00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:38,960
read our blogs share your thoughts

00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:41,540
catch any of us that are here at the

00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,030
conference and join our meetings and our

00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:47,359
intention is to hold all of their agile

00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:48,220
ceremonies in the open beta IRC meetings

00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,590
or blue jeans or

00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:52,210
we're going to do was and we want to

00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:54,040
share our backlog we want to share a

00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:54,760
board we want to get your input we want

00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,560
to get your help

00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,780
feel free to progress anything you want

00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,400
on that backlog that will mean that we

00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,930
have to change as a team we need to be

00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,300
more self service we need to be more

00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:06,160
enabling of the community we need to

00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,660
remove ourselves as bottlenecks power to

00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,490
that removal of bottlenecks is moving

00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:12,359
away from total maintain ership of those

00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:17,500
112 plus applications that we have there

00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:27,730
so that is me have we any questions I

00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:28,869
know we took questions during it yeah so

00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,940
the question is is this agile

00:43:28,869 --> 00:43:33,130
transformation for all of CP are just a

00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:36,040
fedora part and the answer is all of CP

00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:38,320
e so we are unifying as a team it is the

00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:39,700
CentOS team and the Fedora team and we

00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,560
don't want to know send em kind of

00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,750
scenario so one thing that Jim and I in

00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:46,450
particular have focused on is trying to

00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:48,970
have a shared methodology and

00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:52,050
understanding an approach so that we can

00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:52,050
help each other going forward

00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,590
and undertaking with where we're going

00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:20,590
and where we're heading to and so on

00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:23,170
it's like how a GPS works right so you

00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:25,120
know I live in Ireland I'm on a head

00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:26,380
from Waterford to Dublin I pop into GPS

00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,300
for Hell again to the airport and

00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:30,790
that'll take me and hopefully the most

00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:32,500
efficient path forward right but I'll go

00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:33,730
on that part and I'll get distracted and

00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,870
see something shiny and I'll pull off

00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:36,790
the motorway and I've had a completely

00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:38,830
different direction and the GPS starts

00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:40,120
screaming at me to turn around because

00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:42,910
you're gone off the path right you're

00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:44,770
gone away from that plan and if I don't

00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:46,570
turn around it'll eventually recalculate

00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:48,100
and we'll pick a new plan and that's the

00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:50,980
approach we're gonna take to this right

00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:53,800
so access the team members access to

00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:55,870
services access to questions and answers

00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,010
that you need in a timely manner we want

00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:59,170
to have all that and we want to have it

00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:01,450
right now and we know that that's on our

00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:02,860
plan that might shift does the GPS moves

00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:05,200
and we take a different direction and a

00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:06,400
different path forward on it but we're

00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,930
not going to move away from that end

00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,460
goal of where we want to go to we're

00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:11,200
just gonna take a very windy road to get

00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:12,880
in there but it's great that people know

00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,710
where we want to go now and we're doing

00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,110
our level best to do that but if people

00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:18,550
are still concerned about specifics

00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:20,830
that's where we engage that's where we

00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:22,090
talk because I don't have all the

00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:23,980
answers the team don't have all the

00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:25,840
answers and I think if we did it would

00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:27,790
be a very poor agile transformation

00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,260
because we've done this in a vacuum and

00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:31,390
Donna without talking to our main

00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:40,750
communities so this is stage one and

00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:42,430
that kind of plan okay I'm happy to wrap

00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:43,570
it there we grab coffee I'm going to be

00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:45,010
around for the next couple of days that

00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:47,620
people do want to catch me and thank you

00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:50,830
for your time and attendance appreciated

00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,830
