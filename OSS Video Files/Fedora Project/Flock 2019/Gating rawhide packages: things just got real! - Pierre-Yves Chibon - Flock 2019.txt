Title: Gating rawhide packages: things just got real! - Pierre-Yves Chibon - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-09-02
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	Package gating in rawhide is now a reality. Let's walk through how it came to life, how it stands today and how it will look tomorrow.
This is a major change in the packager's workflow in Fedora but it also opens the door to new ways to work in Fedora. With more automation we will free time for our contributors allowing them to invest other parts of our distribution or of the upstream ecosystem.
