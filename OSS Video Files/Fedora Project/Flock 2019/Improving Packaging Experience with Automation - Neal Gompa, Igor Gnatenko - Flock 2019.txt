Title: Improving Packaging Experience with Automation - Neal Gompa, Igor Gnatenko - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-09-02
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	We are working on a Fedora Objective about saving packagersâ€™ time with an automation related to building of their packages. That includes but not limited to automatic rebuild of packages on dependency changes, removing manual work on writing changelog both in spec and later in git and doing release bumps on rebuilds.
This talk is about presenting our ideas of how to improve the quality of life for packagers (the lifeblood of our distribution) and getting feedback (in a panel-ish form) about how to further refine and improve the packaging and maintenance experience. This is becoming increasingly important as the way we deliver software is increasing in complexity with things like modules and flatpaks and whatnot.
