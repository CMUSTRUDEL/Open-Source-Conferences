Title: Building CentOS with Familiar Tools - Brian Stinson - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-09-02
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	With the release of new technologies in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, we needed a new set of tools to build CentOS. Many of these tools: koji, mbs, pungi etc. have been proven out in Fedora, so we decided to explore using those to build our distribution. In this talk we'll discuss some changes to how we build CentOS, and what we've done so far to let folks in our community build their own stuff too, using a koji/mbs distribution called "Mbox".
