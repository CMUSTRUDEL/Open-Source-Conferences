for anyone who doesn't know me I'm

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,790
Steven Gallagher I'm a Red Hat employee

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:20,610
and I've been working on in Fedora for

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:26,850
over a decade now so what is what is

00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:28,080
Fedora server in what is now apparent to

00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,000
me is the distant past

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,850
we used to have only one version of

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,920
Fedora that we released and shipped this

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:41,159
was six years ago now and over time it

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,600
had become apparent that even though

00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:44,819
fedoras beginnings had been in the

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,399
server space people wanting to run run

00:00:44,819 --> 00:00:51,539
servers on commodity hardware time had

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,609
passed and in many ways the desktop had

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,459
taken over the Fedora community and it

00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:58,459
was much more focused on producing a

00:00:56,459 --> 00:01:01,739
desktop and distribution than it was

00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:06,240
giving a place for sir for people to

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:07,980
develop server technologies so we did

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,690
what was then called the Fedora next

00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,240
initiative which involved splitting the

00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:15,210
distribution into a variety of different

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,600
editions one of which was fedora server

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,100
Edition which was going to be focused on

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,530
specifically server technologies

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,880
providing a providing a base platform

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:29,700
for your well the traditional metaphor

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,220
is the in pets versus cattle but I

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,080
prefer to use worker bees versus queen

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,310
bees because there's never you're never

00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,680
going to have an environment that

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,480
doesn't have at least a few queen bees

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,980
in it no matter how modern you've become

00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,540
so but Fedora server was meant to

00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:49,920
develop those technologies for the queen

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:52,440
bees and for a while we were doing some

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,460
interesting things but they were pretty

00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:58,290
much the the the cockpit project is the

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,560
major is a major success that we had

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,420
early on and that has that has expanded

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,860
out and it has been a great success on

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,599
its own has found it has found a very

00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:13,650
very big following in the rel community

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,489
now some of our other efforts did not go

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:20,760
nearly so

00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:22,890
smoothly but ultimately Fedora server

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:29,280
and I say this with a very heavy heart

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:32,609
has failed as a project it is at this

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,810
point in in fedoras lifecycle it is

00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:34,650
running out it is sitting on life

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,609
support

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:41,010
I am pretty much the only consistent

00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:42,269
contributor to the project and I'm more

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,599
or less just keeping the lights on at

00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:47,909
this point we've I've tried several

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:52,260
times to reach out to get more community

00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:56,569
involvement but I think well every time

00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,569
I've done that this has been the result

00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,650
for those who don't understand the

00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:09,120
reference that's a critical failure in a

00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:10,969
role in Dungeons and Dragons what I

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,040
think is part of the problem is that

00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:16,349
time has moved on and the problems that

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,810
we just set out to solve are either

00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:21,989
solved or no longer particularly

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:25,470
relevant yeah in the space added to that

00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:27,810
the fact that we couldn't really

00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:31,470
guarantee an extended lifecycle which is

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:33,419
something that is more or less basic

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:36,209
entry into a server into the server

00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:38,159
space we we tried for a long time to

00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:39,870
explain that where we couldn't

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,579
necessarily maintain the same version

00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,169
number for extended period of time we

00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:45,030
had gone to great lengths to make sure

00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:46,709
that the upgrade process was smooth and

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,199
wouldn't break for him it wouldn't break

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,370
on a regular basis and in fact we've

00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,939
been through several releases where

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:57,599
where our Fedora releases our Fedora

00:03:53,939 --> 00:04:01,579
upgrades broke fewer things than the

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:05,419
than those around releases we were

00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:05,419
simultaneously proud and ashamed of that

00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:11,729
but at the end of the day if you can't

00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,949
say this version will be supported for

00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:20,310
three years people don't pay attention

00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:22,199
so I think what we need to do is we need

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,520
to bring to our server back to the

00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:27,700
drawing board I think we need to decide

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,790
anew what what is its purpose and

00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:35,650
if and if it and if it doesn't have one

00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:37,120
or if it does what is it and it come up

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,460
with a new strategy for how to Fr how to

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,950
develop it ideally in such a way that it

00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:47,860
encourages more people to contribute to

00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:50,730
it first and foremost I don't think it

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:55,360
will come as a surprise to anyone if it

00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:58,180
if I point out that the intent or the

00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,190
the not terribly subtle intent initially

00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:04,120
was we needed some place in Fedora to

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:08,530
very clearly be a stage in ground for

00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:10,120
Red Hat Enterprise Linux and while for a

00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:13,300
long time because of political reasons

00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:16,330
we couldn't say that outright

00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:19,900
it is generally true and I think that it

00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:22,750
may be the time to make that you know

00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:25,180
revisit this as a formal requirement as

00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:27,790
opposed to a wink-wink nudge-nudge you

00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:33,520
know maybe maybe daddy shadow man wants

00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:36,940
the stumps than something but I'm I'm

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,540
here to listen to ideas I've got okay

00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,540
there's one

00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,990
right okay we're not recording so I'm

00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,460
not gonna bother repeating that I think

00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:17,730
everybody could hear Lynn Langdon he's

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:19,560
got a good set of lungs on him yeah I

00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,590
mean I can tell you what the goals were

00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,640
initially but again my perspective on

00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:29,220
this is that those are no longer

00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:31,410
necessarily valid and I think what we

00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,820
need to know I think the first thing we

00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,490
need to do is we need to go back and we

00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:39,810
need to scrap the existing PRD which is

00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:41,750
I think there might be a unit that's

00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:44,850
still valid but that's about it

00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:46,710
all of it is is irrelevant at this point

00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:50,310
we don't longer have a concept of server

00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:51,870
roles we don't I think the only thing I

00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:55,230
think the only thing left in it that is

00:06:51,870 --> 00:07:05,400
that is still useful is the requirements

00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:08,910
that sets down for cockpit but I'm not

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:11,160
sure where to begin because it's easy to

00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:14,250
say okay we need someplace for new

00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,930
server technologies to be built but we

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,010
also need some if you're gonna build

00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,020
something you need someone who's willing

00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,160
to test it and in order to have someone

00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,270
who's willing to test something you have

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,190
to be giving them something that solves

00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:27,840
their it solves a problem I am really

00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:34,620
hoping that there that some of you guys

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:39,570
can can just Express a good problem that

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:41,190
we could be solving here because we're

00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:45,000
in an odd place like I said because we

00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:49,140
have to have this addition as it is is

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,530
useful to to our primary benefactor but

00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:54,030
we also need it to be designed done in

00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,820
such a way that is all stated that it is

00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:58,470
is actually useful both to us and both

00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:01,020
to the Fedora community in general and

00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:03,860
the red heck the Red Hat consumer

00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,860
directly

00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:25,240
and I'm not loving the silence yes okay

00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,030
I'm sorry I was actually also going to

00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,850
point out that there's another aspect to

00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:35,140
all of this that makes things even more

00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:37,060
fuzzy which is the fact that almost

00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,190
anything we could do in the server space

00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,680
is going to be largely irrelevant in

00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:45,400
three to six months and the reason for

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,529
that is that we had that the Apple

00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,140
project is going to be shipping modules

00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:52,779
for rl8 that are built out of the fedora

00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:55,720
out of the fedora environment the fedora

00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:58,390
bed the build systems which means that

00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,130
fundamentally once sent to s eight

00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:02,320
launches people are no one will ever

00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,870
install Fedora server they'll install

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,520
sent a sent OS eight and they'll and

00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,970
then whichever Fedora modules they need

00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,970
from Apple

00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,500
okay so yeah new hardware is an

00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:57,070
interesting an interesting point I'm not

00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:58,420
sure if that's I have a couple of

00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:02,380
additional hands were going up I was

00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:04,300
just letting poop okay that this

00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,420
gentleman has been trying to speak for a

00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,420
while

00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:49,810
for our project no what I was what I was

00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,400
saying I wasn't actually implying

00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:53,770
anything about sent to us currently what

00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,930
I was saying is that what I imagined

00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:58,030
will happen is that they'll take that

00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:00,220
stable the state you know stable

00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:02,020
long-term platform and then because of

00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,790
the primary reason that people use the

00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:06,250
very few people that use Fedora server

00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,990
today use it is because it provides

00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,790
newer packages than what they can get

00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:14,790
out of rel and they need def their

00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:17,140
environments but with the on with the

00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:19,750
you know with the appearance of modules

00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:23,470
they can now have that stable platform

00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:26,260
and they're and they're new to a certain

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:28,000
degree yes not everything but my point

00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:33,240
is I think that that is going to eat

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,240
into our already tiny deployment okay

00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:30,110
for us

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,400
yeah there was a pun in there

00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,860
in

00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:21,940
yeah I mean it did lose out on one

00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:24,670
aspect of the roles that was that was

00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:26,830
intended to be just part of the mmm but

00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:29,200
the cockpit over overall everything on

00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:31,330
the system should have an API asked idea

00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:35,040
that it should be possible to administer

00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:37,000
a single system without having to use a

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,570
overpowered configuration management

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,420
tool and we did we lost out on that but

00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:46,860
truthfully yes ansible is the better

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,860
choice for most things

00:16:03,930 --> 00:17:06,030
I pitched the same the same thing the

00:16:06,690 --> 00:17:08,280
team disagreed and so it would become a

00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:24,870
sir sent to us variant that's what

00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:26,130
you're suggesting I don't know I don't

00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:28,590
know if that solves the same problem

00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:31,020
though because like Alexander was saying

00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,850
that it there is something to be said

00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,650
for integrating from top to bottom to

00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:37,170
have that upstream that will eventually

00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,790
become rel and send to us nine or

00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,990
whatever comes after eight but you know

00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,610
because I can't make forward-looking

00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:44,309
statements so it might not be nine who

00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:46,460
knows could it could be Emmy for all I

00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:46,460
know

00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:57,929
yeah that would be terrible

00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,640
anyway but I think we still do really

00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:03,059
need to have that integration from top

00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,620
to bottom somewhere and I think the I

00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:05,820
think there is some sense and make in

00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:09,260
trying to make a focus you know

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,260
supporting new hardware but

00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,000
that gets really hard for actually

00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:07,610
mostly for legal reasons in Fedora is

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,810
because if if Red Hat isn't won backing

00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:14,690
it there's nobody who there's an awful

00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:15,890
lot of NDA type stuff for pre-release

00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:18,080
hardware that makes things really

00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:20,860
difficult and that makes it hard to do

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,860
that in Fedora

00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,590
right but a lot of it is still kernel

00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,870
enablement which means you're still

00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:41,720
sending patches upstream that suggests

00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:42,980
oh well no I'm not saying it isn't I'm

00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,900
just saying that and say I'm saying that

00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,420
in a lot of cases even those kernel

00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:51,350
patches may remain embargoed until the

00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:53,030
hardware is released so and that's more

00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,650
difficult not not impossible but more

00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:57,530
difficult to do in a public open project

00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,970
because you either have to submit them

00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,650
and have them tested by the community or

00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,960
completely hide them forever

00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,740
at which point why are you rich when

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,100
you're not really working in the

00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,100
community

00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:48,590
yeah it's it's it's worth examining but

00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,149
ultimately I think you know they leave

00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,730
the queen bee side is still gonna look a

00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:54,649
lot like what we have right now I mean

00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:56,450
one of the things and I'm running low on

00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:58,760
time here because unfortunately when I

00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:00,559
when rescheduling this talk I had to be

00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:07,519
moved from a 50-minute to a 25-minute

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:09,289
session is is is what I'm doing right

00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,720
now just keeping the lights on is that

00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:13,580
still is anyone benefiting from that

00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,289
right now because I can continue okay I

00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:19,700
can continue to do that for as long as

00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:21,350
needed but it's still but it's feeling

00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,669
like diminishing it like it's becoming a

00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:24,860
diminishing value and I want to figure

00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:26,179
out how to revitalize that and ideally

00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,470
get somebody else to do some of it when

00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:34,639
I go so I can miss Kay occasionally take

00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:37,240
a vacation without getting paged okay

00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:37,240
thank you Dominic

00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,980
Oh

00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:39,799
yeah I'm fond of saying that if an edge

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,799
case exists free I be able discover it

00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:37,130
[Music]

00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:49,650
yeah and maybe that's a good way to go

00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,940
and it you're right that may actually

00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,470
inspire some people to come in and

00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,660
contribute to at least to write some of

00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:58,380
these tests but because they you know

00:26:54,660 --> 00:27:01,789
that is their usage downstream

00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,789
