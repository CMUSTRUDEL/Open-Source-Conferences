Description: 
	Last year at Flock I attempted to reboot the Fedora Security Team with several initiatives and projects. This talk discusses:

    Progress on these initiatives — have they really made fedora more secure today?
    Lesson learnt from trying to implement disruptive changes in Fedora — talk about successes and failures
    Plans for next year, what else we want to do:
        Talk about Fedora Container security.
        Using fedora package-review tool to scan for security issues.
        Push security updates to our customers faster.
