Title: Use cases for Transtats in the Fedora community - Parag Nemade, Sundeep Anand - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-08-28
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	Transtats (https://transtats.fedoraproject.org/) has been in development for a while by now, however, itâ€™s still new in the community. The project started with an aim to tie up loose ends in the fedora localization process. It can help developers, package maintainers, quality engineers, language maintainers, translators and project managers to ship packages with translation completeness. Furthermore, it can give at-a-glance picture for managing the l10n effort progress, release by release!
The application talks to various services, for example, translation platforms, repositories, build systems, etc. to collect translation data. Moreover, they are analyzed to create meaningful representations. Alerts and notifications are in the pipeline.
This talk is about what Transtats has to offer to the community in g11n space, in addition to this, to understand - what we need to bring in Transtats to make it more effective. A basic crosscheck on what we have next on development road-map and what will benefit the community.
