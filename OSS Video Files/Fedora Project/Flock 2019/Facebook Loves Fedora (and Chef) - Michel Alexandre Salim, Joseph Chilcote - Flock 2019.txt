Title: Facebook Loves Fedora (and Chef) - Michel Alexandre Salim, Joseph Chilcote - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-09-02
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	Facebook as an organization has been using Chef to manage our CentOS servers for years, but recently we've started offering Fedora as a fully-supported desktop option for our employees. This talk will cover the challenges involved in managing a fast-moving platform (upgrade notifications, security updates), securing them (encryption and escrow, password strength enforcement), managing devices while not breaking interactive use cases (all those pesky locks!), and allowing users to customize their setup but in a way that is auditable through what we call API cookbooks.
