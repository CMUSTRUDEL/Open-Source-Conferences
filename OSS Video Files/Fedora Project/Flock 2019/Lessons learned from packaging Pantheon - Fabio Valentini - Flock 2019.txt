Title: Lessons learned from packaging Pantheon - Fabio Valentini - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-08-28
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	It was quite a long journey from my first COPR packages in 2015, to my first official packaging work for fedora 26, to Pantheon becoming an officially recognised Desktop Environment with the release of fedora 30 in 2019.

I would talk about the lessons learned from this work, which include how an upstream project that itself originally was its only consumer (elementaryOS) can adapt to be more distro-agnostic (with Pantheon now being offered by fedora, NixOS, Arch, and others), and how changes in upstream GNOME (or downstream ubuntu / elementaryOS) sometimes make my work harder than it probably needs to be.
