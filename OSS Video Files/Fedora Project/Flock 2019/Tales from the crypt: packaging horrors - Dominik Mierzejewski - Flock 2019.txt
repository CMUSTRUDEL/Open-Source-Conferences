Title: Tales from the crypt: packaging horrors - Dominik Mierzejewski - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-09-02
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	I'm a long-time Fedora user (since the beginning) and contributor (since 2006). I'm a proven packager, sponsor and I served on the Fedora Packaging Committee for many years.

This talk will cover examples of the most egregious violations of best packaging practices I encountered in the wild personally. I will present real-life spec file excerpts, show which packaging guidelines are violated and explain how to do things properly. The audience is encouraged to bring their own examples.
