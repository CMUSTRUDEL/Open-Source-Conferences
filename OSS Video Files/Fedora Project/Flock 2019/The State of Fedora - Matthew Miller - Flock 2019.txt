I am going to walk away from this mic if

00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,129
I do it so that you can't hear me

00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:09,230
everybody should make a kaloud noise

00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:11,500
that indicates that I've suddenly become

00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:14,780
silent that would be very helpful

00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:17,540
welcome to the state of Fedora Talk for

00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:20,300
2019 welcome to flock thank you all for

00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:23,750
coming here here's what I'm going to

00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:27,650
talk about today we had a council

00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:30,349
meeting in like December November last

00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,939
year and had some strategic work we did

00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:34,490
there which I want to talk about here

00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:38,450
how many people read the blog post that

00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:39,800
we made after that okay so that's like a

00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,450
quarter of the room which is which is

00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,280
pretty good hopefully this will be a

00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,950
refresher for you and hopefully it will

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,750
not be shocking to everybody else but

00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,670
that's what I'm talking about then I'm

00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,110
gonna do my traditional charts talk a

00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,640
little bit about some things that are

00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,080
going on in fedora that I find

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,880
interesting that's going to be kind of

00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,830
hurried and will not be comprehensive

00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:10,010
and then I'm going to talk a little bit

00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:12,170
about you know the future okay awesome

00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:15,470
that is good because I'm going to start

00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:17,390
right in with class work here how many

00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:20,360
people have seen something like this

00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:23,360
before all right awesome you've been

00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:27,230
listening to me maybe this is a program

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,540
logic model which is a thing that comes

00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:32,450
from the nonprofit world it's a way of

00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,610
both planning and also evaluating

00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:37,790
whether the thing you're doing has

00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,920
actual impact on the world and the way

00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:45,740
it works you start with your planning

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:47,150
over at the right side with the sort of

00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,530
the mission and vision and what you want

00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:51,650
to accomplish in the world

00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:54,170
so if work for example we're trying to

00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:56,150
end homelessness in a city you know our

00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,770
mission might be and homelessness in the

00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,210
city and the vision might be something

00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:03,350
about you know how everybody is cared

00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:05,720
for and things like that then everything

00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:07,460
gets more concrete going to the left so

00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,649
the outcomes are things that are

00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,620
measurable change so that might be like

00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:14,880
half of the homeless population is in

00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,960
housing something you know

00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,430
you might want to pick some number

00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,530
that's achievable these should be things

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,850
that are something you know like a three

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,040
to five year time frame usually

00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,080
something that is and is a number that

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,030
you can move so maybe also like twenty

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,160
percent more affordable housing stock or

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,300
something like that

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,220
then there's a little squiggly line

00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,830
because those two things are things that

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,720
you want to happen but they're not

00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,020
things you can actually do yourself so

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,640
everything on the left is more concrete

00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,260
and those are things so outputs are

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,360
actually things that you actually do so

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,400
an output might be like if you go the

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,890
Habitat for Humanity approach output

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,280
might be built houses like a number of

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,840
houses that you filt or it might be

00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,750
community grants from local developers

00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,270
banks or might be a zoning laws change

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,250
so things actual results then it gets

00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,870
more obvious going to the left like the

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,720
activities are the things you have to do

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,100
that like build houses or you know do

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,070
community organizing those kind of

00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:13,100
things and then resources are what you

00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:18,930
have to to make that happen

00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:20,730
so this if you've seen ok ours the

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,800
objectives and key results think that's

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,060
actually kind of a small logic model

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,160
kind of thing that doesn't quite as

00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,110
fleshed out as this one I like the big

00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,780
model for programs ok ours is kind of a

00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,920
nice thing for personal achievements but

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,880
it's basically it's really kind of the

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,680
same idea so I have since I started in

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,900
this job wanted to build one of these

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,100
for fedora because it's kind of a thing

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,360
where we want to see what is the impact

00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,280
of Fedora and we want to be able to

00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,620
organize our resources and that's

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,530
actually one of the reasons we started

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,360
on making a new Fedora mission because

00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,930
when we started to look at at the

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,110
mission that was set in like 2012 or so

00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:00,690
it was so big in Grand is it's it's a

00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,910
great thing about leading you know open

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,130
source in the world but it was kind of

00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:08,310
hard to go from what would we do to do

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:10,200
that and also make an operating system

00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,520
was not one of the things that occurred

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,690
to me when I was thinking of what are

00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,480
the things we should do to make that

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,220
mission come true so clearly making an

00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,010
operating system is fundamental to what

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,470
Fedora does so we kind of we changed

00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,240
that mission a little bit to this which

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:28,110
is in such fine print I can't actually

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,650
read it there but basically we make an

00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,350
operating

00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:33,780
system and we also make it easy for the

00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,220
community to build solutions for users

00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,900
on that operating system like that's

00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,780
that's the mission that we've got here

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,940
however we are kind of missing a vision

00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:46,259
statement when we worked on that mission

00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:48,090
before we were kind of focused on

00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,039
solving this problem of the mission is

00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,320
too too broad and we need to have

00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:54,270
something that we can act on that we're

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,020
still also you know thews devout and

00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:01,169
proud of so we kind of set aside the

00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,729
vision vision setting which I kind of

00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:04,590
think that we we need to fill that in

00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:06,840
and have something that kind of talks

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:09,600
about the world we want to make with

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:13,770
fedora so this is actually a pitch it's

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,090
in disguise we have elected positions on

00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,919
the Fedora Council and that is this

00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,930
working on this stuff is one of the main

00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:20,550
jobs that the Fedora Council if this

00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,710
interests you even a little bit if you

00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,840
kind of have an idea for how you know

00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:26,460
what Fedora to change the world run for

00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,720
the Fedora Council in the next election

00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:32,669
and come help us do this we also have

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,870
kind of some vagueness in the outcome so

00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:35,220
this is kind of one of the one of the

00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,610
problems here is it's hard to measure

00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,780
fedora fill out for privacy reasons and

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,220
because we're doing a lot of different

00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,110
messy things so this is something else

00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,120
we could do some more work on obviously

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,680
I'll show you my charts and graphs later

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,150
which is some part of it but there's a

00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,360
lot of other things that we could

00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:53,010
measure that we could probably do better

00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,050
but we do have these things that are the

00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:57,180
Fedora objectives that are kind of

00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:00,240
specific things each which has its own

00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:02,669
outcome that is a measurable thing so

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,449
those those things kind of fit into what

00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:08,970
we have is the fidor outcomes then the

00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:11,099
outputs are you know the the things we

00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,949
mean we make and I think these are these

00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:15,389
are pretty good and a lot of ways we're

00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:18,539
actually actually doing this in the

00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:19,770
middle from the middle out when when you

00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:21,690
do this process you're really supposed

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,370
to start with the impact you know and a

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,530
greenfield and work back to what you

00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:28,440
want to do obviously we kind of have

00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:30,690
outputs and then we go both directions

00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,900
from there which is just the reality if

00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:39,029
working with a project that's over 15 16

00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:41,630
17 years old so yeah and then activities

00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:42,900
you know the stuff we actually do and

00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,120
resources

00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,889
our time or the money we get from

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,440
various sources a hardware we have those

00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:51,270
kind of things so in theory you know

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,150
once you have this all done everything

00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:56,370
that's a resource you know flows nicely

00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,900
into the things we do and all the way to

00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,270
the right and you can kind of go both

00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:03,150
ways back and forth in a nice satisfying

00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:05,280
neat way that both shows that what

00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:09,840
you're doing has impact on the mission

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,780
and also that you know the mission has

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,009
all the things it needs to actually be

00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,229
accomplished and so this is a really

00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:18,690
useful tool like when I go to for

00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:21,449
example Denise here and say hey we need

00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:23,520
help with this and I can say we need

00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:25,320
this thing here because look at this

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,449
line through to the thing we're trying

00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,880
to accomplish in fedora and then it's a

00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:32,880
much easier argument to make than just a

00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:40,800
I wish I had this argument which I also

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:43,830
do makes up all right so to the fedora

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,630
council hackfest we kind of went in with

00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,639
us so we had this mission we want to

00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:49,949
make it easy for people to build Fedora

00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:52,139
solutions in fedora and the basic

00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:55,530
problem we went in with is it's too hard

00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:57,810
things are kind of chaotic in fedora how

00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:00,630
do we how do we actually make that

00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,400
mission be a true statement what can we

00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,289
do to adjust the way Fedora is

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,750
structured to work on that and so we

00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:09,240
have came up with basically two major

00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,250
themes there's a nice blog post which is

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,229
now actually in the docs stuff for our

00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,090
project org page that kind of goes

00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:17,699
through this I encourage you to read but

00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:21,060
I'm also going to summarize here so yeah

00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:22,590
the first thing is these objectives and

00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,620
so I've talked about the objectives

00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:27,030
before objective leads are people who

00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,130
are you tasked with driving this to

00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:33,180
completion and that's actually a a

00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:35,070
part-time Council position as well we

00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,740
have a new thing where these objectives

00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:41,789
get status updates and it's dashboard

00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:44,370
and actually any team in Fedora can talk

00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:46,110
to Ben cotton and get your a weekly

00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:49,380
status added there this is kind of a

00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:51,360
business style red green yellow kind of

00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,240
what what's the state of the of this sub

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,220
project and one of the reasons to do

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,460
this is a lot of times we've had we've

00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,380
had

00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,760
trouble getting good status reads from

00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,840
the objectives even when there's work

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,840
going on and it's kind of hard to do

00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,640
that communication in in sync with the

00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,860
fedora meetings if maybe you're not a

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,720
full-time Red Hatter and we really

00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,550
wanted this to be open to anybody who

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,730
wants to have this kind of big impact on

00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:19,020
improving the project so we wanted to

00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,030
make it so you can have kind of a more

00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,070
async approach to giving the status

00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:26,310
outputs and again been our program

00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:28,020
manager is taking care of that I'll say

00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,670
here's some examples of some of the

00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:32,040
objectives that are kind of tied

00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:35,520
directly to this idea of making it

00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,530
easier to build solutions in fedora the

00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,180
minimization effort which is basically

00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:42,420
we could if we start with a smaller

00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:45,720
Fedora core then it's easier to build

00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,220
things on top of that of course as I

00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,290
always say it's not doesn't mean we're

00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,720
going back to a fedora core that is a

00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,550
red hat thing the Fedora core in this

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,750
sense we belongs to all of us and that's

00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,800
why we're not calling it Fedora core

00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,860
because you don't have that argument

00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,690
right but I think that's that's a pretty

00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,400
exciting thing the gating stuff there's

00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,200
a huge amount of talks at this

00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,920
conference about gating and automation

00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:11,100
and CI that I think will be really

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,020
interesting modularity it's still work

00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,880
in progress of course but it's still

00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,130
again it is for this goal of making it

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,440
easier to build things that move at

00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:21,450
different speeds to fast to slow kind of

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,660
the fundamental problem of operating

00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:27,780
systems we are very slowly but steadily

00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,580
going to solve that again making it

00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,200
easier to package things and for our

00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:34,020
packaging is a fundamental activity of

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,000
the project and then also again going

00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,530
back to the the long form of the mission

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,830
where you says we have you know

00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:44,790
platforms for hardware clouds and

00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:47,100
containers IOT is an area where we

00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:50,130
didn't really have a very good offering

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,390
so launching an edition is made an

00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,160
objective because we want to make sure

00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,840
we're covering that segment that we

00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,050
hadn't really before so making an

00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,580
addition as part of the thing so the

00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,010
other thing we worked on was this idea

00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:06,180
of teams building blocks services and

00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:08,400
solutions and we actually went into this

00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,240
with a longer document with a whole lot

00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,950
of jargon and

00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,850
terminology taking some of the existing

00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:17,279
jargon with sig's and working groups and

00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,260
spins and labs and all of these things

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,779
and we'd actually come up with a pretty

00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,370
complicated process and then about

00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:25,860
halfway through the day we threw that

00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:29,630
all away and so we narrowed down the

00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:32,339
jargon to to a smaller things basically

00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:34,649
in any group in fedora whether it's a

00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,390
cig or a more formal structured working

00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:38,910
group or any things are basically just a

00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:41,130
team and you can call your team whatever

00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:43,350
seems appropriate for that for the team

00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:45,510
we decided not to have like codified

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:48,390
hierarchy of different sub projects in

00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:50,100
fedora but a team is anybody that

00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,600
provides a building block an output that

00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,709
can be used to do other things or

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:58,410
services to something else so for

00:11:55,709 --> 00:12:00,180
example these are some teams in fedora I

00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,790
think they're all existing well

00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:05,040
established teams they make something or

00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:07,140
they do something for somebody else and

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,709
then you know the services that they

00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:21,180
provide and I think that's all pretty

00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:22,620
obvious so the end goal of that is once

00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,630
you have all these teams that are doing

00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,630
providing services and making building

00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:30,360
blocks those building blocks time to be

00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:32,130
put together to make a solution this is

00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,750
not a marketing term we don't want to

00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:36,240
have like a fedora solutions page

00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:38,160
somewhere I think that will probably

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,140
upset our corporate benefactors among

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,690
other things but it's kind of what the

00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:44,160
idea of what we're actually doing this

00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,899
is something for end users that

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,050
addresses a problem they have and that's

00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:50,610
kind of we want the things that fedora

00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,500
does to actually be useful to people

00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,760
it's not just an abstract thing where

00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,290
we're building an operating system for

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,790
ourselves we want to make sure we're

00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,670
building it for other people because

00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:01,050
otherwise what's the point of it so you

00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,959
know the things that are our traditional

00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:08,790
additions and labs and spins those are

00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:11,010
basically the solutions and one of the

00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:13,829
things we want we highlighted in this is

00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:16,350
that if you're a team in fedora this is

00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:18,270
again this is one of the Debian social

00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:20,839
contract things I think is important is

00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:23,310
you can't make somebody else do work

00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:26,249
because a lot of us evolve

00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:28,889
tears and even people working for Red

00:13:26,249 --> 00:13:30,120
Hat are either following a team agenda

00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:32,370
they have at Red Hat or else they're

00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,050
volunteering on this thing and just

00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:36,029
because you want to have something done

00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:37,709
doesn't necessarily mean that you're

00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:40,410
going to line up everybody else to do it

00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:43,110
so the teams can set what they are going

00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:45,660
to do and why and they we would really

00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:48,509
like teams to kind of advertise this is

00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:50,939
what we do and this is how this is how

00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:52,769
you get services from our team and we

00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:55,110
know what kind of levels they will they

00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:57,420
will do it for so we might for example

00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:59,430
you know if you're a web development

00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,170
team you might say you know if this is

00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:03,870
one of those big offerings we'll

00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:08,220
prioritize making a nice fancy splash

00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:09,870
page for you if somebody comes and X is

00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:13,050
not here but I'll use the stay for

00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:15,569
example if you want to make a fedora for

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:17,639
a llama her tours llama farmers that

00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:20,129
might not be one of our bigger target

00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,509
audiences it's still important but you

00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:23,550
know to the people who use it but it's

00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:26,040
not necessarily a gigantic mass-market

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,899
thing so the web design team say might

00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,519
say okay we can provide you you know a

00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:31,470
scaffolding and you we don't know

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,910
anything about llama farming so you can

00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,829
fill out what that's going to look like

00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,220
but here's the process that kind of

00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:37,800
thing

00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:40,199
again solution not not a marketing term

00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:43,889
it's just kind of the practical impact

00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:47,519
of it so if you looked at the mission

00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:50,399
statement here one of the things that's

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:53,309
a little bit complicated about it kind

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,629
of unique is that mission statement kind

00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:58,319
of looks like it's eating its own tail

00:14:54,629 --> 00:15:00,000
because we have at this side you know

00:14:58,319 --> 00:15:03,449
fedora creates this innovative platform

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,629
for hardware and clouds of tanners and

00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:08,370
then that enables software developers

00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:11,699
and community members to build solutions

00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:13,350
so there's kind of a this is which side

00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:15,449
are we it might be it seems like it

00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,860
might be easier if we say oh we build

00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:19,100
solutions for users that's our mission

00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:22,259
or it might be we create this platform

00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,970
who cares about the users but we kind of

00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:26,759
wanted to put that all together an

00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:30,809
example that kind of might be some other

00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:32,790
other distribution might say you this is

00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:35,519
our main focus we make this one thing

00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,360
and if you have a solution for some

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,970
other problem

00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,309
you're you can be a downstream of us but

00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:43,170
you're not really part of the project in

00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:45,209
Fedora we want to have a different

00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:47,129
approach where we all work together no

00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:49,799
matter even if you are addressing the

00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:52,350
llama herding problem like we would like

00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:54,509
you to come do that as part of fedora in

00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:59,100
fedora because when we work all together

00:15:54,509 --> 00:16:00,569
like that it the shared work can be

00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,670
useful to other people and it just kind

00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:06,600
of builds a nice bigger everybody as

00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:08,879
friends think that I but I like so to

00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,069
rephrase that the same mission statement

00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:14,519
basically and putting the team's concept

00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:16,619
in it teams create this platform and

00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:18,480
when enable other teams also in fedora

00:16:16,619 --> 00:16:20,579
to make make the solution so that's kind

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,019
of that's the structure we came to and

00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:24,480
kind of makes them I hope what makes

00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:26,279
that eating its own tail mission

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,779
statement could make more sense about

00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:29,779
how we want fedora to work

00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:41,560
so an example that you know for example

00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,600
it might be the Python classroom lab

00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:47,020
which is meant unit for teaching Python

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,940
in a classroom that team mean makes that

00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:51,430
solution for for that particular use

00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:53,230
case but also does a lot of work on

00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:55,600
Python in general that benefits the

00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:57,820
whole project so that's an example of a

00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,160
team that kind of exists mainly you know

00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,290
for that that end in solution but also

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:10,450
has the whole benefit all together when

00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:12,900
we that way so yeah the overall policy

00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:15,100
putting all together but or as a whole

00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,530
focuses on enabling teams to build

00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:20,320
solutions so when someone in marketing

00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:24,310
right had asked me what's fedoras user

00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:26,940
base I say well it's complicated but

00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:30,100
fedora at fedoras user base is really

00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:32,230
fedora other fedora teams like the what

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,420
what is fedora as a general project like

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:36,730
it's for the teams to build solutions

00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,800
but then the fedora teams each have

00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,110
their own audience and mission and those

00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,910
kind of things so it's a multi-level

00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:45,790
thing Fedora is is big and we're

00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:47,110
basically a portfolio project so we try

00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:53,470
to address a lot of these different use

00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:55,600
cases but we also still have some of

00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:57,310
these big category platform solutions we

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,950
have fedora or workstation we have

00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:01,240
fedora server and these kind of things

00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:03,490
that hit these areas that we've

00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,990
identified as big strategic things these

00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:07,120
are the things that can enable that

00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:09,400
platform I'm through being in an

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,470
end-user solution like the work that the

00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,630
desktop team does on all of the things

00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:16,150
for you know their genome based foot or

00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:18,370
workstation benefits all of the desktop

00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:21,520
Linux is in huge amount of ways so it's

00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:25,570
both in enabler and a basic platform to

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,190
build on um but right now as a project

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:29,350
again with what the objectives we're

00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:32,290
focusing on we really need to focus on

00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:34,480
the things that make the story about we

00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:36,130
built this operating system and we make

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,990
this available to people we need to

00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:41,020
focus on the things that make that true

00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:43,930
so this is one of the things I mean we

00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:45,370
focus a lot on the gating and CI kind of

00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,620
things we haven't focused so much on

00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:49,030
end-user things a lot that's why the

00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,470
objectives

00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,970
we kind of had we had a university

00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:54,250
outreach objective and it didn't really

00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:56,260
go anywhere and part of it is we're not

00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,270
ready for that right now we've got to

00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,429
get some of these things our developer

00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:02,890
outreach our developer story we need to

00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:04,960
get our we can we are we are the best at

00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:08,080
making this platform story together

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,179
before we get there so if if some of

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,370
these things go well I hope that you

00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:13,929
know next flock will be talking about a

00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,760
little bit more about some of the user

00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:25,559
outreach and those kind of things that

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:28,390
we can do and I want to end this with

00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:30,309
this part with some of the kind of basic

00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:32,320
guidelines we came up with teams one of

00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:33,809
the things we kind of had this is

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,580
something to talk about in the council

00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:40,510
when do you need to ask permission to do

00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:41,980
things generally don't like if it's

00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,570
something that's in your area and

00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,280
especially if it's something that like

00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:47,289
you know could be put back if you

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,480
accidentally made a mistake like just do

00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:50,500
the thing in your area it's it's not

00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,240
something you need to stop and ask

00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,919
permission for this something often get

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,559
where people are like I would do that

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,450
but I don't want to post a develop you

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,539
are going to complain and then I will

00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:02,980
not get anywhere with it you should post

00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:05,530
a develops because there are a lot of

00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:10,720
people here with a lot of wisdom who can

00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:12,880
give feedback and input and but people

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,429
who have feedback and input who which

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,260
are not involved in the thing are also

00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:18,970
not able to block you just because

00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,880
somebody complains about something

00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:23,140
doesn't mean that you shouldn't go ahead

00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,330
and experiment with that but you might

00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,620
want to take their concerns into account

00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:29,049
especially if it's you know affecting

00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:31,750
something they're doing so you know

00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:40,240
communication is important please do it

00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:42,610
I guess that's again teams right yeah if

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,039
a majority of ESCO say not to do it then

00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:46,750
we may have a further conversation but

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,750
we've also may want to find a place

00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:52,150
where you can do that thing so if ESCO

00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,380
says for example you should not move the

00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,970
architecture that's the base

00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,049
architecture for the door up to

00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:59,559
something that only works on new

00:20:56,049 --> 00:21:00,999
hardware but some people really want to

00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:03,369
have a build that only works

00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:05,619
on that hardware we should try and find

00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:07,539
out a way so that that both both of

00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:10,029
those things can be accommodated that's

00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:12,129
a pretty big one right there so that

00:21:10,029 --> 00:21:13,299
that one particular it's hard but there

00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:15,249
are a lot of things that are smaller

00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:17,229
where it's like okay well let's find a

00:21:15,249 --> 00:21:20,289
place to the side where you can do this

00:21:17,229 --> 00:21:21,639
and make that available to people of

00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:25,479
course that's very situational a

00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:26,949
dependent again focus on you know what

00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:28,919
you can do in this thing this is how

00:21:26,949 --> 00:21:31,149
could we make this happen

00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:34,479
clearly you're coming to us with some

00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:36,429
need or some idea let's figure out how

00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:39,069
to let people's ideas happen rather than

00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:40,959
saying your idea doesn't work for us go

00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:42,669
somewhere else because again I want

00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:45,039
fedora to be this big inviting

00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:48,489
experimental area where people can do

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:50,409
all these different things and again

00:21:48,489 --> 00:21:52,149
yeah if if you're a team and you're like

00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:54,099
wow I'm being asked to do so many

00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:54,909
different things like take a look at

00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:57,669
this

00:21:54,909 --> 00:21:59,589
not quite filled out mission logic model

00:21:57,669 --> 00:22:01,569
and see like where where do these things

00:21:59,589 --> 00:22:03,459
fit into the current Fedora goals and

00:22:01,569 --> 00:22:05,289
kind of try and prioritize around those

00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:10,029
things I think that will help us overall

00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:11,619
as a project one of the tools we have to

00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:13,929
kind of help with this we have a site

00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:16,329
teams Don Fedora project org which is

00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:19,479
running a hosted version of Tyga Tyga is

00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:23,379
an entirely open-source project planning

00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:26,589
Kanban board software you may find the

00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:29,079
Kanban features you know it's like cards

00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:32,319
in columns kind of workflow thing you

00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:34,509
may find that helpful it's something

00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:37,059
that maybe doesn't scale as big as if

00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:39,399
you are you know a 20-person team

00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:41,799
working on some sort of project I know

00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:45,369
Lee is not a gigantic fan of this for

00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:46,989
his team's project work but it also is a

00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:49,839
place where if every team has some

00:22:46,989 --> 00:22:52,209
amount of presence here we have kind of

00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:54,159
a live update of which teams are

00:22:52,209 --> 00:22:56,319
actually active right now and we try to

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,019
show the organization of fedora we look

00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:01,059
at all the teams in the wiki and we've

00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:02,499
got wiki pages that are ten years old

00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:04,239
and out of date like there's a fedora

00:23:02,499 --> 00:23:05,739
minimization sig which never actually

00:23:04,239 --> 00:23:07,629
did anything but as like a hundred

00:23:05,739 --> 00:23:09,669
people signed up for it Adam who is the

00:23:07,629 --> 00:23:11,919
objective lead for minimization didn't

00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:13,719
even know that it existed because it

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,809
wasn't really didn't really exist and

00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:16,460
there's no really good

00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:20,059
to tell from the wiki if a team is

00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:23,289
active so if everybody has who is an

00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:26,360
active team makes a presence on taiga

00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:28,249
anybody who is a fast account can log in

00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,960
and create a project and then if you

00:23:28,249 --> 00:23:32,629
have to file a ticket to be moved to a

00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,940
top level or than a personal project but

00:23:32,629 --> 00:23:37,190
create something like that and show some

00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,539
of your team's activity I think that

00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,669
will that will help us kind of have a

00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:42,679
directory of what the active teams are

00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:44,629
in fedora this is something that I was

00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:46,190
kind of hoping the hub's project would

00:23:44,629 --> 00:23:47,960
rest in peace

00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,700
the hub's project but it would provide

00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,440
us but since we we don't really have the

00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,559
resources to develop this this can kind

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,840
of give us a a lightweight view of that

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,940
kind of active teams and one of the

00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:02,509
things I talked about as a possible

00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:05,690
intern project so taiga has a like

00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:07,369
Activity Feed kind of thing one of the

00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:10,549
things that would be nice is there's an

00:24:07,369 --> 00:24:12,470
API for injecting stuff into it so an

00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:14,990
intern project might be some tools to

00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:17,090
take existing things in Fedora fed

00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:19,549
messages pegar issues and things like

00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:21,649
that and inject them into the feed so

00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:23,440
that that teams work in other parts of

00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:26,450
the project becomes visible in this

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,999
team's thing so this is an idea an

00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:30,590
experiment we'll see if it works out if

00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:32,240
it doesn't you know it's a hosted

00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:35,360
service so it'll be very easy for us to

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,090
turn off but that that's one of the

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,090
places when two entities all right

00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:45,559
thus endeth the talking about strategy

00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:49,549
portion of the talk it is time for some

00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:53,570
dinosaurs probably you're familiar with

00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:55,820
this already fedora it doesn't do deep

00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:58,490
invasive tracking or very much tracking

00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:01,159
at all of systems so my knowledge of

00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:03,470
which systems are installed in the wild

00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:05,269
comes solely from observing our mirror

00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:07,909
traffic data and there are a lot of

00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:10,749
reasons that these numbers are not

00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:14,299
concrete network topology influences it

00:25:10,749 --> 00:25:17,149
all sorts of things there's some work to

00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:21,610
do some better statistics gathering on

00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:25,279
DNF and the core OS team also has a a

00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:27,710
kind of opt out but always but on by

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,280
default metrics gathering system which I

00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,960
think will be interesting

00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,490
you see but that's not hooked up yet so

00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,970
this is still these same traditional

00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:38,060
numbers here this is the mirror stats

00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:41,510
for the last 10 Fedora releases here so

00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:44,870
we can see that our 30 and growing up

00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:46,820
there it is kind of leveling off there

00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:49,220
it'll be interesting to see if this ends

00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:52,550
up being you know a a growth release I

00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:54,290
think partly rl8 coming out may have

00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:57,320
stolen some of the excitement from that

00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:58,670
and there's a pretty decent theory that

00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,980
every time there's a new rail release

00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:02,660
people who are like to follow the

00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,930
leading edge concentrate on that release

00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:08,090
for a little bit but we'll see how that

00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:11,180
the impact of that is the oat the

00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:13,400
overall picture here is still general

00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:17,120
growth you'll notice there's a little

00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:19,700
slope down at the end every time I give

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,710
a talk at flock the slides have a little

00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:24,230
slope down in the end so I think that's

00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:25,640
kind of a seasonal thing I am quite

00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:30,320
confident that it's going to continue

00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:32,630
going up there I also wanted to show the

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,700
stats for Fedora Apple I'm actually when

00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:37,700
we do these out of order this is the

00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:39,770
total for Apple the red line there and

00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:42,320
the blue line is the total for the

00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:45,140
Fedora OS mere stats so I want to

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,600
emphasize the place where we have the

00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:52,640
biggest user impact in the world is

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:54,350
clearly in Apple so even if you feel

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,990
like oh that's something over on the

00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:58,550
enterprise sento se side of things I

00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,410
encourage you to care about it a little

00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:02,060
bit because there's a lot of users for

00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,380
whom it's very important so this is

00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:07,250
something that I think we've got a lot

00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:10,070
of we could do more there and yeah this

00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:13,010
slide is just the apple pie versions

00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:16,280
there you can see just in time for rl8

00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:18,200
to come out Apple 7 is finally beat 6 so

00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,570
again you know the enterprise linux

00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,430
users are somewhat conservative so

00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:27,140
that's also also worth taking into

00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:28,670
account all right that was all the

00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,880
graphs I'm gonna show this time because

00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:33,230
I'm going to run out of time if I if I

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,960
do a lot more I could I could do another

00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:41,450
20 minutes of talking about graphs but I

00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:42,859
will not a lightning talk yeah okay

00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:44,539
I'm going to talk a little bit about

00:27:42,859 --> 00:27:47,089
some of the things I find interesting

00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:49,429
going on right now and there are a lot

00:27:47,089 --> 00:27:51,979
of talks about these things at this

00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:53,479
conference rawhide gating is finally

00:27:51,979 --> 00:27:57,440
enabled this is something we've been

00:27:53,479 --> 00:28:00,139
talking about for Thank You Denise you

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,599
know for a very long time five years at

00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:04,039
least about making rawhide the

00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:06,529
development tree something that actually

00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:09,739
isn't broken all the time something you

00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:12,139
can use yeah I remember a Linux weekly

00:28:09,739 --> 00:28:15,289
news article about this from like 2010

00:28:12,139 --> 00:28:16,879
so you know it's it's been on our minds

00:28:15,289 --> 00:28:19,099
for a long time and finally we're doing

00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:21,109
something about it so I find this

00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:24,289
amazing thank you everybody who worked

00:28:21,109 --> 00:28:27,249
on this it's very cool

00:28:24,289 --> 00:28:31,539
another big effort this minimization

00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:31,539
objective thank you

00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:38,629
finding a way to define a a smaller base

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,279
operating system for fedora and making

00:28:38,629 --> 00:28:42,409
it so that we can have in smaller

00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:45,409
containers and smaller bases for all

00:28:42,409 --> 00:28:47,899
these solutions is just the flexibility

00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:51,169
that having everything you know neatly

00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:54,889
organized and not having a lot of

00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:57,229
baggage that we does not spark joy in in

00:28:54,889 --> 00:29:00,320
our minimal containers is going to bring

00:28:57,229 --> 00:29:03,229
a lot of flexibility to us ah fedora

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,239
Corliss has launched it's been a year

00:29:03,229 --> 00:29:08,209
and a half since Red Hat acquired that

00:29:05,239 --> 00:29:10,879
company and so we finally actually have

00:29:08,209 --> 00:29:13,099
a release out the door of this our

00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:16,309
container operating system based on

00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:17,929
fedora I think this is a huge

00:29:16,309 --> 00:29:19,219
achievement and pretty exciting I think

00:29:17,929 --> 00:29:22,579
it's neat that how we could integrate

00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:23,749
that into the Fedora family they've kind

00:29:22,579 --> 00:29:26,239
of brought along some of their own

00:29:23,749 --> 00:29:28,519
tooling and ideas and kind of an a new

00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:30,799
tool change for building it that I think

00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:32,899
we could learn a lot from in the rest of

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,839
fedora there's also ways that we could

00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:38,299
tie that tool chain into fedora better I

00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:41,989
think right now it's not sending out fed

00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:43,639
messages when it would be nice to so

00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:46,639
that we can kind of get some of the

00:29:43,639 --> 00:29:47,659
statistics on that so there's this is an

00:29:46,639 --> 00:29:49,279
example of you know doing some

00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:50,869
experimentation that we also want to

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,729
make sure it doesn't just leave floating

00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:54,859
out as an experiment and we take the

00:29:52,729 --> 00:29:55,340
successes from it and integrate it into

00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:58,700
the way we

00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:01,100
other things in the project Fedora

00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:03,380
silver blue is kind of based on these

00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:05,270
same rpm OS tree technologies it's a

00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:08,180
workstation that is based on you know

00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:10,040
these made for the cloud technologies

00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:11,720
that give us an immutable operating

00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:14,540
system something the desktop team is

00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,880
working very heavily on and I'm

00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:20,360
particularly excited about this because

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:23,450
I have seen more blog posts and YouTube

00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:26,300
videos and excitement in reddit threads

00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:28,730
from people not in this room then I have

00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:31,160
about fedora for anything for a lot of

00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:33,230
years so there's a lot that's scary

00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,240
about this it makes your your desktop

00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:37,070
system work very differently from people

00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,470
are used to with a traditional Linux

00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:42,140
desktop operating system but I think the

00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:44,030
potential here is so huge that this is

00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:46,610
something we really should be interested

00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:48,920
in and there's a talk on fedora toolbox

00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:52,220
which is a container based way of

00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:54,620
working on silver-blue that I think is

00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,210
very interesting well make it so that

00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,890
this is an operating system that's sort

00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:00,530
of focused on living in a container

00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:02,510
world and this will give us a desktop

00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:04,370
offering that we really like we show

00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:05,810
people this is something different from

00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:07,250
what you're used to and this is

00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:11,450
something that will give you tools and

00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:13,730
an experience that is better for living

00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:16,730
in the modern computing world so that's

00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:20,960
very exciting for our IOT I mentioned

00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:24,260
that before this is you a in addition

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,210
made for this use case that we hadn't

00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:28,430
really covered before we we've had arm

00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:30,920
spin kind of things before but again

00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:34,370
this uses that same rpm OS tree

00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:36,620
technology to provide a experience that

00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:38,300
actually be used for people out actually

00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:40,010
running you and run this in your home

00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,140
and not have to worry about updating it

00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:44,540
yourself every six months and you know

00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:46,850
will my will my home automation still

00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:49,400
work after after updating the next door

00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:51,890
version this uses that container model

00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,690
to deliver that in a way that will be

00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:56,360
consistent you can actually use it to do

00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:59,480
things I am particularly excited about

00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:01,760
this we have some really big like

00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,740
corporate users who are interested in

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:07,520
this I'm actually very interested in for

00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:09,770
the home user use case because this is

00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,780
when I got into come

00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:14,030
I could make an apple to do just about

00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:16,610
anything that Apple 2 could possibly do

00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:18,320
now you know my kids using computers

00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:20,930
they you know the games and just

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,610
everything they look at is nothing that

00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:24,530
was developed by one person like you

00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:26,450
can't take a computer and you can't you

00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:30,050
know make fortnight or whatever just

00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:32,120
yourself in your spare time whereas so

00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:34,250
kind of we've lost that hands on

00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,260
computing thing and I think IOT is a

00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:38,030
place where you can take a little device

00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,560
and you can actually make it control

00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:41,240
your lights you can make it control you

00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,310
know the heating in your house and you

00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,320
can do these kind of home projects that

00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:47,750
actually your use of computing is

00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,640
something within your hands within in

00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:51,290
your scale and you can actually do cool

00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:54,710
things with it so I think this is an

00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:56,690
important basically gateway to the next

00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:59,920
generation of fedora contributors that

00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:02,990
we need to make sure we are investing in

00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:04,310
another big thing I didn't have a cool

00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:06,800
graphic for this so I just did a

00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:09,980
screenshot this is the new ask fedora

00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:12,500
site it was previously based on ask bot

00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:17,090
which is a terrible clone of Stack

00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:18,320
Exchange we switched to for number

00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:20,420
reasons that I can talk about in the

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:24,170
hallway discourse which is an entirely

00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:28,190
open source web forum kind of platform

00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:30,470
that has we're using a hosted version of

00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:33,320
and this was really entirely run by

00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:35,060
people from the fedora join sig who kind

00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,500
of took this and set it up with the

00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,420
different languages and own things and

00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,340
this has been very successful the

00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,200
traffic is already at the levels where

00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,970
we're you know maybe need to consider

00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:47,600
paying for the next higher hosting plan

00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:49,640
which is a great problem to have yeah so

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,950
this is uh and this is you know if

00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:55,100
people come to you with fedora questions

00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:57,830
and you don't have time to answer them

00:33:55,100 --> 00:34:00,910
like I often do not this is a good place

00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:03,350
to send people to because there's a

00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:04,850
pretty good community of people who are

00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:07,520
interested in helping out other people

00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:09,919
in fedora and also if you are bored and

00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:12,260
want to help out people um stop by and

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:17,810
find some questions in your in your area

00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:22,460
and answer them on the less optimistic

00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:24,919
side year or so

00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:27,679
robee duck Robert Meyer who's a been our

00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:29,659
web team lead for a long time got a

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,760
different job and ended up with a lot

00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:34,839
less spare time to work on fedora he's

00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:39,230
been doing Fedora web stuff for you know

00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:41,329
an amazing job for a long time we are

00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:43,460
basically without a functional web team

00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:47,030
in fedora right now and we've gotten

00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:49,399
some temporary work from people at Red

00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:52,010
Hat to do this but redhead is not going

00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:53,839
to fund a web team for us so this is a

00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:57,619
team that kind of needs to be rebuilt

00:34:53,839 --> 00:35:01,220
because you can't be a modern thing

00:34:57,619 --> 00:35:03,740
without the web at all so if you're

00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:06,829
interested in working on web development

00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:08,990
in fedora come talk to me because we

00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:13,180
need we need a new team built up around

00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:13,180
this all right

00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:39,310
or just let you read that why drink

00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,420
all right so some of the things that are

00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:51,390
basically challenges to work on things

00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:53,800
that we need we need to do better

00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:55,960
particularly in order to really make

00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:59,170
this whole thing of people can provide

00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:02,170
solutions right now to make something

00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:04,330
that's an output in Fedora a spin or a

00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:06,940
container or whatever you want to make

00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:10,060
that is a lot of manual work that goes

00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:14,590
into this thing called the compose it's

00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:16,420
all capital letters the compose and I

00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:17,980
don't know what the time for that

00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,330
composes right now but it was up to the

00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,470
play time where it was like taking over

00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:22,960
it

00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,130
what's that okay yeah so it's down to

00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,869
four and a half hours

00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:27,990
which is pretty awesome it was up to

00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:31,240
like 18 hours and pretty pretty crazy

00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:33,250
but even with a shorter compose time

00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,890
which that is almost ability to make two

00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:39,849
composes in a day which is going to be

00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:41,800
huge one of the problems we have is this

00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:43,690
idea of like blocking the release so

00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,750
every release we have something like

00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:49,119
where we can either say our artifact

00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:51,220
stopped Fedora from being released so if

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,609
there's an error in the lama

00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:56,530
herding distribution we will not release

00:36:54,609 --> 00:36:59,560
the Dora at all that week which would

00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:03,369
make a lot of people sad and angry to

00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:06,310
various degrees or we can say well sorry

00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:08,859
llama people no updates for you until

00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:11,320
the next six months which of course

00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:12,880
makes those people sad and as I said

00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,890
earlier we want to make sure that

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,780
everybody who has these solutions have

00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:19,119
you know is able to do them in fedora

00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:23,050
and has you know it's treated with value

00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:25,869
so an alternate approach would be okay

00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:28,330
llama people you are on your own

00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:31,060
but here's a push button you can push

00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:33,190
you put put your parameters in here hit

00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:35,830
this button and out will come your llama

00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:38,080
spin on you know the federal release

00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:40,290
cycle or you know the week after or the

00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:43,000
week if you're ready two weeks before

00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:47,349
why wait so you could make you know

00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,720
maybe for some reason the llama farming

00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:51,010
cycle you know is is a seasonal thing so

00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,500
you maybe want to have a new llama

00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:55,119
farming release every every three months

00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,740
you should be able to do that or maybe

00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,510
once a year because you

00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:01,510
need to update things that infrequently

00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:03,610
so we need to be able to decouple those

00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:06,730
things and I think that in order to do

00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:08,140
this we should to do this right we

00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:10,390
should do this for everything everything

00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:12,430
we all of the outputs in fedora you know

00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:14,440
from the big things like for workstation

00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:17,320
you know down to the little things Nero

00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:20,080
fedora and those things they should all

00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,610
be self-service like this in the same

00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,470
sort of way even if it turns out that

00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:25,000
you know for the big things the release

00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:27,220
engineering team one of the things they

00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:32,920
provide is yeah we we Shepherd that

00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:35,050
through not a llama joke just we need a

00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:38,050
lot more automation in order to do this

00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:41,440
a lot of the work we do in fedora is

00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:44,410
manual labor that is not really great

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,480
use of human intelligence a lot of the

00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:48,160
packaging we do where we take something

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,970
that is an upstream package and then we

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:54,910
reformat into our packaging format we're

00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:57,340
not really adding any value to that at

00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:59,560
all like there's no reason you'd go for

00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:02,500
Fedora because you know our version of

00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:06,400
this Perl sub dependency is the better

00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:13,030
one than the Debian one at least I hope

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:14,800
that's not sure that would be but we've

00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:16,600
got to find ways that that the human

00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,010
effort we have and we only have so many

00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,470
people we want to make sure that the

00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:23,859
human effort we have is used to the best

00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:25,990
amount well we still are able to cope

00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:28,300
with the exploding amount of open-source

00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:30,100
software out in the world and this just

00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:33,130
doesn't scale to humans so we need to

00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:35,170
find a better way to do that we also

00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:38,050
kind of as part of automation we need to

00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:39,580
move where we do our quality checks and

00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:41,800
I think we've been doing doing some of

00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:43,180
this but mostly right now we check for

00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:46,330
quality viously

00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:48,670
at the borders when a new package comes

00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:51,190
in to fedora we do a rigorous package

00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:53,530
review and then after you're past the

00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:55,660
reviewed the dirty secret is you can do

00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:58,420
whatever you want to that spec file and

00:39:55,660 --> 00:40:01,930
you know people have and nothing really

00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:04,150
stops you so we need to do some kind of

00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:07,060
things that that make that better and

00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:10,590
then then other place is with QA but we

00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:10,590
do extensive QA

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:17,260
using reading other users passwords

00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:17,260
requires permission thank you

00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:22,280
we do extensive QA at the Fedora

00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:24,020
releases but we don't do QA on like

00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,840
update batches and things like that

00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:29,780
again it's a border check as we as the

00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:31,460
as it leaves the project out to users we

00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:35,480
do a check but we don't do much

00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:39,410
continuous QA so again a CI CD efforts

00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:41,690
will really help with that finally we've

00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:44,750
got to do something we better about

00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:47,420
packaging dependencies in general people

00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:49,580
who are interested in I know some of you

00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:51,560
are are exceptions to this in this room

00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:53,420
but in general people who want to make

00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,250
something available in Fedora I want to

00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:56,120
make an application available something

00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,980
for end-users

00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:00,170
and it usually is the case that that

00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:04,130
package especially these days has you

00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:05,960
know 300 dependencies and getting each

00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:08,600
of those 300 dependencies through

00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:14,180
individual package review is not a good

00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:16,640
use of time and what's worse if you do

00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:18,800
what we call the right thing and D

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,260
bundle and get each one of those things

00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,390
through package review you now end up

00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:26,210
being the owner of one application you

00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:34,550
care about and 300 dependencies that you

00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:36,560
don't give any cares about and but

00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:39,320
you've told everybody I'm the maintainer

00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,420
of this and that you know that lie is

00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,250
not really very helpful because someone

00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,040
else comes along and sees oh this is in

00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:49,910
fedora it must be maintained and builds

00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:51,740
dependencies on it and it's not a it's

00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:53,630
not a good situation so we need you know

00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:56,090
I don't know the answer to that but in a

00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:58,460
lot of ways this is a big data problem

00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:01,670
these days again when there's thousands

00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:03,740
of dependencies like there are other

00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:05,720
ways we can attach to attack this rather

00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:08,480
than having a human go through and

00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:10,160
package up at us and claim ownership of

00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,100
it even when they don't really own it so

00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,600
I don't know the answer to that but we

00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:19,820
that's something we really should work

00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:21,200
on switching this is actually organized

00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,880
after that after the first part of the

00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,380
talk it all it all comes to

00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,319
in a nice way if you see the whole thing

00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:29,119
together but from from the teams and

00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:30,650
building blocks thing I talked about

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,720
there are a couple things that kind of

00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:35,150
fall out of this about how we present in

00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,890
market and organize fedora one of them

00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:39,859
is something I've been saying for a

00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:42,289
while but which is hard to hard habit to

00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:43,490
break this is just like you know Red Hat

00:42:42,289 --> 00:42:46,160
doesn't want you to call Rhett

00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:48,559
Enterprise Linux Red Hat Microsoft when

00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,900
I was in college some of my friends

00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:51,769
would call Microsoft Word Microsoft

00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,750
right driving me crazy

00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:56,660
or you know the the thing that comes

00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:59,569
with Lego the little thing says please

00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:01,759
do not color blocks Legos call them LEGO

00:42:59,569 --> 00:43:04,880
building blocks right this is this is

00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:06,559
the same thing we want fedora to be this

00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,319
is fedora in this room we're fedora

00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:11,059
we're the project Fedora operating

00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:12,410
systems and outputs our Fedora

00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:14,000
workstation fedora

00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:16,309
you know the Fedora package collection

00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,200
those kind of things that that's a I

00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:20,329
know that's a heart discipline but if we

00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:24,410
all start doing it maybe it will slowly

00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:28,549
trickle out into the world and then the

00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:30,829
other part of that is like if we want

00:43:28,549 --> 00:43:33,799
these different artifacts to connect

00:43:30,829 --> 00:43:36,230
with their audiences it's okay if we

00:43:33,799 --> 00:43:38,599
make it be la motte Ron OS by fedora

00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:41,539
rather than think fedoras llama try no

00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:43,339
ass you know if people want to do it the

00:43:41,539 --> 00:43:48,019
other way around that's fine but I think

00:43:43,339 --> 00:43:50,089
we go back with yeah these here you can

00:43:48,019 --> 00:43:52,430
see both of these have fedora and then

00:43:50,089 --> 00:43:54,740
coral asses is a strong brand silver

00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:56,390
blue as it's a little bit less bold

00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:59,000
there but kind of the strong brand is

00:43:56,390 --> 00:44:01,309
the thing and this is with these two

00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,559
things is kind of happening naturally we

00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:05,660
started out with fedora cloud fedora

00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:07,759
workstation for our server these cannon

00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,890
Eric descriptors and we're moving to

00:44:07,759 --> 00:44:12,170
kind of a branded thing and I actually

00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:15,230
asked the IOT Edition people to come up

00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:16,519
with a shiny name for the IOT Edition as

00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:20,410
well because I think they're gonna fits

00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:23,390
the scheme now I've lost where I was

00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:26,140
yeah so I think that's that's kind of a

00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:28,490
shift from how we've marketed things I

00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:30,829
know there's a little bit of worry like

00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:32,390
is this all gonna fall apart into a kind

00:44:30,829 --> 00:44:33,799
of chaotic thing where nothing's tied

00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:35,460
together and everything that its own

00:44:33,799 --> 00:44:38,670
little fiefdom

00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:40,230
um maybe I think that the communication

00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:42,210
and just the idea that you know we do

00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:44,520
want to all work together and even if

00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:46,980
fedoras not the like the front of the

00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,359
name we all still is fedora and we're

00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:51,569
all working together I think that will

00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:54,000
help and I think that branding that way

00:44:51,569 --> 00:44:57,240
is better than the alternative which is

00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,849
that fedora slowly becomes irrelevant to

00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,010
everybody who's not already in this in

00:44:59,849 --> 00:45:04,559
this room in the Fedora world already

00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:06,000
where Fedora is a primary value so I

00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:08,130
think it allows us to reach out so

00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,770
that's that's kind of a change to how

00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:12,630
we've done things and I be interesting

00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:17,520
to see how that goes but that's my

00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:19,020
preference for it and then finally it's

00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,760
kind of some more I talked about you

00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,680
know what what the vision is and I don't

00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,660
have a vision statement for fedora yet

00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,760
but again run for council help me work

00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:28,800
on it some things that I know though the

00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,900
next time there's a doc or the next time

00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,819
someone wants to build core OS we want

00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,190
them to be oh yeah well fedora is the

00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:37,200
obvious place to work on that we don't

00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:38,550
want them to say you know go off and

00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,910
build their own district from scratch

00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:45,839
like we want to be the place to do those

00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:47,609
things we should find a way all that

00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:50,190
open source all those thousands of

00:45:47,609 --> 00:45:52,440
packages Java and Python and Ruby and

00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:54,450
node in those things we should find a

00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:56,180
place to integrate all of those into

00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:58,589
something that it all works together

00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:00,119
even if it doesn't mean repackaging at

00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:02,970
all in rpms or if it does mean

00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:05,849
repackaging in rpms make that such a

00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:07,650
minor detail that nobody even needs to

00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:12,480
know that that's happening unless they

00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:14,250
really care we've got to catch the next

00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,799
generation of developers and cinnamons

00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:19,710
where they are where they are right now

00:46:16,799 --> 00:46:22,200
is github so we need to figure that out

00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:23,849
because we have a very strong open

00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:25,680
source ethos you know it's all the

00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:28,440
hosted things that I talked about like

00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,089
those are open source products they're

00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:32,010
not even open core those are like pure

00:46:30,089 --> 00:46:34,520
open source Play companies which is

00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:38,040
awesome and I love to support those but

00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:40,650
if all of the energy in the world around

00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:43,980
open source is really kind of in these

00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:45,839
areas maybe get lab as a possibility but

00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:48,119
that doesn't really have the network

00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,110
effect everybody's individual github

00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:51,420
asset such as

00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:52,980
strong network effect that we need to be

00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,060
able to address that I don't again I

00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:56,400
don't know the answer to that and I

00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:58,530
don't know how to figure out how to you

00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,480
know keep true to our Freedom Foundation

00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:02,340
and something that really it's important

00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,410
to us about making this world where

00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:06,300
everybody has an open source free

00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:08,160
software experience I don't know how to

00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:10,230
do that but we need to find an answer to

00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,620
that because we're in trouble if we

00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:13,860
don't

00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:16,140
and finally this thing where every

00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:19,020
operating system it moves both too fast

00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:21,120
and too slow at the same time it's still

00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:22,620
a problem you know that the technologies

00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:26,490
were working with modularity the

00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:29,340
container stuff flat packs snaps for our

00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:32,220
friends working on snaps these these

00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:34,590
things are attempting to work on that

00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:37,290
but we don't have it solved yet and I

00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:39,900
would really like you know the the

00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:42,800
register headlines to be you know Wow

00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:45,930
fedora has solved this big problem that

00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:50,400
what I would like to see so how we get

00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:52,140
there it's up to you guys so let's let's

00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,450
figure out how to do it together there

00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:57,510
are a lot of talks here about automation

00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:59,100
and modularity and things things towards

00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:03,200
these problems so I think this will be

00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:06,560
an exciting good conference and yeah

00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,560
