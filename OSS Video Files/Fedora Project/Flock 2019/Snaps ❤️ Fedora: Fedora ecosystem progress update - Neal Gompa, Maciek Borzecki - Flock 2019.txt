Title: Snaps ❤️ Fedora: Fedora ecosystem progress update - Neal Gompa, Maciek Borzecki - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-08-28
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	Since last year, the Snap upstream developers and I have been working to improve the quality of life for Fedora users with snaps.
From security improvements to simple enhancements to improve how snaps integrate with the system, there's been a lot of work specifically to improve how snaps work on Fedora and Enterprise Linux.
This talk will be about describing these improvements and the work in progress for feedback for improvement.
