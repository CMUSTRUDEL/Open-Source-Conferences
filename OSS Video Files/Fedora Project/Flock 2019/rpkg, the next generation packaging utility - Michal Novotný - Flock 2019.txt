	Call for feedback.

I'd like to present a new rpkg packaging utility, which is almost ready to improve overall packaging experience in Fedora. One of the benefits is that it brings the solution to the long-standing problem of duplicating changelog messages in Git commit records as well as in the spec files but it can do much more than that.

The above problem was solved in a generic way by introduction of spec file templates, which additionally allows for storing packages in DistGit in their unpacked ("upstream") form, which can be preferred for some projects. And there is more spec templates can do.

In addition, rpkg should allow to define package-wide commands, which then extend the basic rpkg functionality for the given package. This can be for example used for integration with Bugzilla to e.g. close bugs automatically when a new release is done that fixes them. It can be also used to make rpkg distribution-specific (e.g. by adding integration with specific build system, specific issue tracker, etc.) only by editing the main rpkg.conf file and adding spec requirements for the newly defined commands.
