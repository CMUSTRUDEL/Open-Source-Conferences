Description: 
	A Simplified Approach to User Testing.

User research is a crucial point for following a user-centered design approach. However, there might not be enough resources to prioritize it.
We will cover the value of doing research, choosing the right methods, organizing and running research, in just a few steps with minimal resources. These methods can be applied by any Fedora contributor to any project they are contributing to.

I am Renata I'm a UX researcher I work

00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:14,500
with a design to improve visibility of

00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:19,630
open source software I am also a part of

00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:24,490
open source design and I started my UX

00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:26,980
research doing UX research throughout

00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:31,840
reaching where I take usability testing

00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:38,650
for you know I am also a part of fedoras

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:41,579
diversity and inclusion team so designs

00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,579
or assumptions

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,870
was

00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:54,700
when developers and designers are

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:57,820
building the user interface so what they

00:00:54,700 --> 00:01:01,090
have in mind they they build it with

00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,020
them how they think the is the best way

00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:06,540
for the users

00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:12,119
but in the end news likely events and

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:17,800
ends up being proved wrong by the users

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:21,640
and so it becomes very hard for them to

00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:27,630
use to actually use the software so and

00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,630
that is what people do usually the users

00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:39,100
[Music]

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,770
which is and this keeps just going on

00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:47,890
and spiraling so it becomes like a bad

00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:49,780
ways where and this happens also in

00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,020
every kind of software but especially

00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:55,020
mostly on open source software

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,020
visibility

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:05,070
so there's a way how to stop the retreat

00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:10,530
and that is doing user research what

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:15,060
yes it's connecting the end-users with

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:18,390
designers and developers so you just

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:22,260
find a way to translate the users needs

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:27,730
and to show them to developers designers

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:30,770
so they take them to considerations

00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:34,989
so there are a lot of ways that you can

00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:34,989
do user research using

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:50,360
cordials mm and it is letsa mean for me

00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:56,090
matter for conducting user research and

00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:59,240
it's the most effective one so but

00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:01,820
before we get into me explaining how to

00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:05,380
conduct the usability test I just want

00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:07,970
to show you some use cases so on

00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:14,500
software that I've been working the past

00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:14,500
year one of them is HTTPS Everywhere so

00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:19,750
this is a

00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:22,870
the first design that they did and they

00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,360
tell it for years it's basically it

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:29,940
turned out to be nothing

00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:33,180
it's a bunch of services and just links

00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:35,640
and we get few iterations of user

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:39,660
research and usability testing and we

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:44,730
did some surveys and we did after four

00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:47,040
iterations we concluded this this design

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:51,200
which is the final design and will be

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,200
implemented soon by HTTP emigrate

00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,860
another example is under preferences

00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:01,110
redesign so this was the original

00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:04,230
suitable design when we did a user

00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:06,450
research and through the usability

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:12,180
testing sessions we saw that the users

00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:14,700
could not be able to use the sample very

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,620
well and inside wisdom through user

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,140
friendly because it has so much

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,600
components going on and they did not

00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:25,370
know how to distinct them for example

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,370
they always messed up security

00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:34,220
which everyone has rich options this is

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,640
after the redesign this is a mock-up

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:41,260
that we did so we narrowed down the

00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,260
options in the sidebar

00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:57,540
and it to be much easier to use this

00:04:52,410 --> 00:05:02,340
will always also be in the third use

00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:07,940
case they chose prior buyer is a secure

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,940
messaging app this is not actually a

00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,420
[Music]

00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:47,440
through the screen then we decided this

00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:50,890
was better with coming up with a version

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:58,420
which should be the other one that gets

00:05:50,890 --> 00:06:03,670
implemented so hopefully you're

00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:06,460
convinced that doing research it's good

00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:11,950
and you want to know how to test it so

00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:13,060
how can you do it it's fairly easy it

00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:18,480
easy

00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:18,480
so most people have a misconception

00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:25,770
testing the session moon big left and a

00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:27,850
lot of resources actually a lot of

00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:30,940
Fester's and

00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:34,090
experience people to test them but

00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,830
that's not the case I think everyone can

00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:39,160
do that

00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:41,170
you basically just a few things I'm

00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:46,770
going to show you how you can conduct a

00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:50,380
usability test on only three steps so

00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:53,350
the first step is just choosing

00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:56,110
personalize what I mean by that is you

00:06:53,350 --> 00:07:03,010
should move the target users for the

00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:06,280
software that you want to test for this

00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:07,900
example I wanted to take software you

00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,690
know sell food because it's fairly

00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:13,180
easier to explain but you can apply the

00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:16,990
same things to whichever somewhere that

00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:19,690
you choose so the first step that you

00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:22,360
should think of is who uses from

00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:25,840
software if we were to test right now

00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,300
here we would say okay we should test

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,690
with designers so we would include in

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,690
our test

00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:37,569
more experienced ones but in this case

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:41,469
no software should be used by everyone

00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:46,589
so we should make sure to include in our

00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:46,589
testing diverse range of participants

00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:58,370
so after we really have come up with the

00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:01,130
target accusers and now we can move on

00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:03,230
to scenario tests but cinema that's all

00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:06,440
they are with the three tasks that you

00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:12,410
gave to each participant they can

00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:15,020
accomplish for example so no

00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:17,960
software the first time does might be

00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:21,560
you choose an application and you tell

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:24,890
the tester to install that application

00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:29,420
and you you watch how they do it and you

00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:32,150
see you get to observe if it's easy for

00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:37,729
them to find the software that you're

00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:41,600
looking for and to install the second

00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:51,760
task might be to remove an installed

00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:51,760
software and just find out

00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:01,320
application and then remove it they go

00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:04,410
to applications or because there are a

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,139
lot of ways that the user can get to the

00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:14,430
famous quarry but we should just observe

00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:16,769
each user how they do it another thought

00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:20,279
might be just to update preferences so

00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:26,910
you can observe if the user knows and

00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:34,920
understands if they know what this means

00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:38,279
and how to use the screen another task

00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,990
might be just looking for updates but

00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:42,899
you should be careful while doing the

00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:52,500
test so you should not give in to the

00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:56,040
users do not use the words like update

00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,750
find an application find updates you can

00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,550
just say like can you find out the

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,170
version of this application and then

00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:05,519
they should find out by themselves

00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:08,600
because if you give hints then there is

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:15,990
no point in testing usability of that

00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:16,850
you can do how many toasts just 5

00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,239
customs

00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:22,459
and 5.5 Japan toasts it's more than

00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:24,829
enough to uncover new security issues

00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:26,600
but if you want to get more specific and

00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:28,959
to get more details and you can do more

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,959
than that

00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:43,239
this is another toss for example if you

00:10:34,989 --> 00:11:08,439
want to find out if so after we are done

00:10:43,239 --> 00:11:18,149
with and that's it

00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:18,149
so you see it's important to be

00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:32,379
and you get to observe the user well

00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:37,089
it's a competition with us another thing

00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:40,329
you might not like me this during the

00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:44,499
desk so because it's important when with

00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:47,559
that soft starts you shouldn't start the

00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:50,980
best for you just set on a timer and

00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:54,009
measure each step through how how much

00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:56,769
time each task is taking and you do not

00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:58,989
interrupt them all the questions that

00:11:56,769 --> 00:12:01,509
you might have you just write them down

00:11:58,989 --> 00:12:04,470
and wait until the testing session is

00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:04,470
done and then

00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:45,920
so after you've so it's it's fine so

00:12:24,140 --> 00:13:03,170
this is the issues to other people

00:12:45,920 --> 00:13:05,450
understand this is basically you get

00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:08,340
everything that you got from the

00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:12,210
disability I think so our screen shots

00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:15,510
and excluding everything and also giving

00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:18,830
recommendations on how to improve this

00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:20,320
if you do not

00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:23,450
or don't know how to give

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:27,290
recommendations and on improvements you

00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:30,579
can easily just just let them know about

00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:33,389
the results and the issues and then

00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:36,730
might have an idea on how to enter

00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:41,350
another four month that you can do is

00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:43,809
then I will be or shorter paper you can

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:47,040
do a live presentation we've been also

00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:51,419
just file an issue about records and

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,419
explain suitability issue

00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:05,680
so a great tool to help with showing the

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:09,369
result is actually visualization

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:14,490
use angels and just one of the points

00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:19,740
that have issues so we're not doing for

00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:19,740
users and after you mark on time

00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:28,150
you can also use charts or tables or

00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:30,970
whatever whatever visualization tool

00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:37,240
that you think would fit your own

00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:39,170
results heat maps are a great way to

00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,810
show

00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:46,170
so basically I think map is the people

00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:49,560
of each task and how each test of food

00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:51,930
on each side on one side of the table we

00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,019
have listed all the class that you gave

00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:59,130
to user and the other side is the booth

00:14:55,019 --> 00:15:02,190
boxes so every box every every color has

00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:05,160
its own name so for example the green

00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:08,160
boxes represent the cost but very very

00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:12,449
easy to accomplish then the yellow dust

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:16,440
are basically where the users had more

00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:22,769
issues the red ones or when they pass

00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:25,519
the time and the black ones are

00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:30,660
basically the class where the user just

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:33,930
could not get how to do that and this is

00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:43,500
a great way to get the results for

00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:46,430
people who are not interested in get an

00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,430
overall feeling

00:15:54,210 --> 00:16:01,680
so hopefully by now you are able to and

00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:03,510
you know how you can contribute by doing

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,210
user research and usability testing

00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:09,920
we've talked about how to do user user

00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:12,330
research what is it why is important and

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:17,880
most importantly how to present the

00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:20,730
result so hopefully you'll contribute to

00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:25,220
fedoras experience and thank you so much

00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:25,220
if you have any questions let me know

00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,910
is there any user experience testing

00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:41,660
program

00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:41,660
I think so too

00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:53,190
and the user experience and

00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:59,180
and also accessibility go under the

00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:59,180
design so it's not this thing I think

00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,380
so aware of the technical bugs

00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,340
overview

00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:30,389
[Music]

00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:36,440
but maybe

00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:46,070
they do think they have a special

00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:53,260
present instance major design month and

00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:53,260
their summer vacation

00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,140
they made some

00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:11,480
goodbye yeah yes

00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:33,589
[Music]

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,010
so they

00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,559
[Music]

00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:00,240
you can like us

00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,820
it's

00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:15,360
so us only thing mostly it's still like

00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:37,130
I think that they find it or something

00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:37,130
like once I miss people

00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,130
yeah

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,120
this

00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,910
is

00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,570
position

00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,930
I just

00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,700
you see somewhere around

00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,820
right

00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,500
he seems to

00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:26,460
[Music]

00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:33,920
so there's always green and red maybe

00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,920
black boxes no because

00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:44,260
business perfect

00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:51,960
we will try ways to make it more green

00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:51,960
and yellow friendly

00:22:55,430 --> 00:23:04,170
are there any resource applications

00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:11,300
which use automated units experience

00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:11,300
metric by measuring whether people are

00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:28,319
but my nation is always

00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:36,650
because in person you get other people

00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:47,309
[Music]

00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,570
get off

00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:16,840
because they agreed it's the advice

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,840
but we have

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:26,380
so even intensive application which

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,580
I like this I don't like this sentiment

00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:15,210
property for the community so I know the

00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,210
