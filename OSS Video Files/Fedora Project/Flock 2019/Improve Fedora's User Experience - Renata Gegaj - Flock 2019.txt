Description: 
	A Simplified Approach to User Testing.

User research is a crucial point for following a user-centered design approach. However, there might not be enough resources to prioritize it.
We will cover the value of doing research, choosing the right methods, organizing and running research, in just a few steps with minimal resources. These methods can be applied by any Fedora contributor to any project they are contributing to.
