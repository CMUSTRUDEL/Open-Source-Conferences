The Fedora Summer Coding project showcase and meet-up is a recurring event each year that does the following:

    Gives a platform to Summer Coding interns to present their accomplishments and work to Fedora community
    Share knowledge and wisdom among mentors and empower more people in Fedora community to participate as mentors
    Provide unstructured time to network and meet others involved with Fedora Summer Coding

The goals for this session are to celebrate the accomplishments of the numerous interns working on Fedora and to build up the Fedora Summer Coding initiative. This gives interns a chance to share their work with a wider audience and to invite more people to participate as mentors or admins in future rounds of Fedora's Summer Coding initiatives like Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and Outreachy.
