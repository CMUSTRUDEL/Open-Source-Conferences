Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	What's the difference between a functional team and a failing team? How do we make a failing team functional, and a functional team great? Let's talk about layers of communication, why outcomes are more important than process, and how to figure out where to begin - and whether you should.

I'm introducing Kate Houston who is our

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,970
guest keynote speaker her job title is

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,380
robot emoji crown emoji at automatic you

00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,660
may know them as the company that makes

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,250
WordPress which is what we happen to use

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,590
for the community blog and Fedora

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:23,070
magazine Kate's going to talk about

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,510
dysfunctional teams you might have some

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,029
experience with dysfunctional teams

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,590
whether at your day job or in a certain

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:32,730
community project you might contribute

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,199
to and you know teams are just people so

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,390
it doesn't really matter if it's work or

00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:38,159
volunteer it's still gonna have some of

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,780
the same dysfunctions and some of the

00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,699
same functions that Kate's gonna tell us

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,710
how to fix and this is the world

00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:48,079
premiere of her talk so if it's a little

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,079
rough don't worry it's probably fine

00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:58,199
[Applause]

00:00:52,579 --> 00:01:00,420
thank you I love it when people

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:02,069
introduce me like that cuz now you know

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,520
he set the boss suitably low so

00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:08,370
hopefully I won't disappoint you

00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:10,740
so my name is Kate and I am a fixer

00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:13,890
I take teams that are struggling and I

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,170
help them improve deliver more deliver

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,960
better and feel better about it feel

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,510
happier but what does that have to do

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:26,580
with your team you know I'm sure most of

00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:28,940
your teams are probably fine right now I

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,340
mean this is an open-source conference

00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:34,860
how do you know though like if I asked

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:39,320
you how good your team is how do you

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:44,250
answer and are you sure

00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:46,320
what's your frame of reference so in

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,180
general almost everybody thinks their

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,680
team could be better but almost

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,070
everybody thinks their team is mostly

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,890
okay so what if I ask you a different

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,040
question like how much has your team

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:02,580
improved in the last year

00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:04,380
now how confident are you so people

00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,420
generally have much more confidence in

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,459
how their team has improved or you know

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,109
gone downhill over the last time period

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,540
you know and if we think about a

00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:13,050
concrete example like is 30 story points

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,700
good

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:21,990
I mean this depends entirely on the

00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:24,240
context right so in teams a lot of

00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,800
things become clearer when you realize

00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,890
that it's easier to measure progress

00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,720
than state and so instead of asking the

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,790
question like how can we be right we can

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,550
set us the question how can we be less

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,350
wrong

00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:40,020
so let's reframe the question of like is

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,960
your team good or not you probably don't

00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:46,140
know and instead ask the question how do

00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,270
teams improve you know I'm just gonna

00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,160
would use my value into capitalism here

00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:53,400
and tell you that like I'm not really a

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,110
fixer because there is no fixer if you

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,670
have a team that needs to improve and

00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,710
you want to turn it around it takes the

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,110
whole team buying in to do that it's an

00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:03,420
adventure you go on together so I'm

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:06,210
really more of a facilitator than a

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,550
fixer so today we're going to talk about

00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:11,550
the four layers of team functioning I'm

00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:13,140
gonna ask four questions so there's four

00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,750
layers in the team we can think about

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,180
these in terms of communication but also

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,940
these are the work that we do to create

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:25,650
clarity and agreement in each level so

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:30,660
mission the why strategy the how tactics

00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:33,450
the what execution the deal so the

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,100
mission is the why and it's useful at

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:38,070
the level where it tells you not just

00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,440
what you do but what you don't do so

00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:42,450
automatic has a mission to democratize

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,700
publishing but that's much too broad for

00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,560
any team so when I was running the

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,300
mobile team we would talk about making a

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,550
great experience for mobile only or

00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,650
mobile primary users so what does that

00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,530
tell us about what we don't do well we

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,850
don't try to make computer users happy

00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:01,500
maybe this is not the audience to tell

00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:03,660
that to you and the team owner now the

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,920
developer experience team you know we

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,530
talk about being a support for the

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,239
entire engineering org focused on acting

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,250
is an accelerant at the inflection

00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,770
points and teams so there's some key

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:16,380
words in the statement right inflection

00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:18,180
point so this is you know a moment of

00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,950
change in the team so when we add a new

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,359
hire or there's a new team lead or a new

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,520
project we want to be present and

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,190
supporting them are we inviting

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,270
ourselves to everyone's weekly meeting

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:30,020
absolutely

00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:31,580
not another keyword is support you know

00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,379
we're there to support the team so are

00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,710
we there to dictate to them like

00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:38,150
permanently knowing now teams without a

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,400
mission don't really know what their

00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:42,169
purpose is and the failure mode is like

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,330
analysis paralysis and kind of

00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:45,650
abdicating decisions like no decisions

00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:49,250
can be made until we know what our

00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:52,220
purpose is so how do you determine your

00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:54,830
mission well it should be aspirational

00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:58,310
but also kind of within grasp you know

00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:00,199
often the way I was handed down but you

00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,870
have to extract and articulate the why

00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,819
you know in craft a sentence that really

00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:08,030
captures the purpose and guiding

00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:10,220
principle of your team how important is

00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:12,139
it well the main benefit is better

00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,210
decision-making you know in a certain

00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:16,190
level of cohesion teams without a

00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,020
mission often spiral and spin from thing

00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,400
to thing but even if you have the

00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:26,020
mission it doesn't really help without

00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:26,020
everything else so strategy is the help

00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:29,870
and there's made up of proximate

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,310
objectives I'm a little bit obsessed

00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,020
with this term it comes from a book

00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:35,150
called good strategy but bad strategy

00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,909
but the proximate objective is you're

00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:39,650
like next achievable goal so if we think

00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:41,090
about the example of the mobile team and

00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,919
when we talked about making what could

00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,659
be great on mobile great you know we

00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:46,460
could break it down so what can be great

00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:49,009
on mobile or you can have a really great

00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,779
media experience on mobile you can have

00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:54,380
a really great notifications experience

00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:56,240
offline is usually better when we were

00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,529
working like waiting this year we've

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,300
been working on scaling our hiring

00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:01,789
process and right we have a number goal

00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,409
but our initial got focused our initial

00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:04,969
approximate objective is to build out

00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:06,830
our capacity because it's much more

00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:09,289
tractable once you have that capacity

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,449
you can push on other levers now

00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:13,490
strategy is the decisions that you make

00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:15,199
to deliver on the mission and if you

00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,060
haven't made the decisions you can't

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,710
work towards it so teams without a

00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,539
strategy struggle to make decisions

00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:23,930
because almost anything can be declared

00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:25,460
to support the mission so how do you

00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,560
determine this strategy well good

00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,330
strategy requires depth and it requires

00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,960
breadth it takes the context of your

00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:34,310
team the organization the broader world

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,669
but here's the thing most strategy is

00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:40,700
bad so this is from the book good

00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:42,860
strategy bad strategy a good strategy

00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,930
does more than urges forward towards a

00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,760
goal or a vision a good strategy

00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,100
honestly acknowledges the challenges

00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,110
being faced and provides an approach to

00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,970
overcoming them and the greater the

00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,160
challenge the more a good strategy

00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:57,440
focuses and coordinates efforts to

00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,610
achieve a powerful competitive punch or

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:04,040
problem-solving effective

00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:06,650
bad strategy tends to skip over pesky

00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,380
details such as problems it ignores the

00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:11,570
power of choice and focus trying instead

00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:14,120
to accommodate a multitude of

00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:15,650
conflicting demands and interests like a

00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,440
quarterback whose only advice to

00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,720
teammates is let's win bad strategy

00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,730
covers up its failure to guide by

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:28,160
embracing the language of broad goals

00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:32,450
ambition vision and values does that

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,190
remind anyone of anything so strategy

00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:35,840
taken from one place won't work

00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,550
elsewhere and this is actually the most

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,650
common failure mode of executives as

00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:42,440
they take what it works in one place to

00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:44,120
another place and it doesn't work but

00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,710
this can be true even within your

00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,590
organization because absolutely

00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:50,450
everything is contextual now strategy is

00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,970
tangible and progress can be measured

00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:54,260
you know if we deciding to improve the

00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,790
media experience we could make it

00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,490
concrete you know we could identify

00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:59,720
improvements based on user feedback

00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:02,030
looking at other best-in-class media

00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,030
experiences we could measure it you know

00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,530
metrics around upload and failure

00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:08,210
building out capacity similarly in our

00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:10,310
hiring process is tangible

00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,840
we know how many interviews we conduct

00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,660
in a given week and we know how long

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,610
everybody has to wait now the most

00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,980
important piece of strategy is what you

00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,780
decide not to do now some things you

00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,490
might decide not to do yet and some

00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:28,160
things you might decide not to do ever

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:30,110
but not deciding is deciding to fail so

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,550
you you know when you develop your

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,560
strategy you look at the different ways

00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:35,590
that you might make progress against

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,240
your mission and you make decisions in

00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:39,979
engineering teams I really like theming

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,479
things so taking a group of smaller

00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:44,630
projects and grouping them together

00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:47,990
around with some kind of theme that we

00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:50,330
expect to improve you need to understand

00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,640
your metrics so what are your leading

00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,480
indicators of your high-level goal you

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,550
know in higher

00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,480
it's so easy because our leading metrics

00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:01,190
at people at every stage in the process

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,750
but you know in software development it

00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,340
can be more complicated but you can

00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,810
definitely find your metrics if you

00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,730
spend enough time understanding them

00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,590
like how your one week retention

00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:12,500
influences your one month attention and

00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:14,630
your annual renewal your strategy has to

00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,640
fit the team that you have you might

00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:19,900
have ten initiatives but if you can only

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:24,890
staff two then you have to choose to

00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:26,450
doing everything is not a strategy and

00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,010
the other thing to think about with your

00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:31,580
strategy is what would make you change

00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:33,710
your approach so you know you decide you

00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:41,540
know you commit and then you validate

00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:43,490
and you weaken it tactics are the one

00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,560
they're the concrete things that make

00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:48,020
things go so you can also think of this

00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,850
as the process layer and it makes the

00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,670
connection between the strategy and the

00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,200
work of the individual but the tactics

00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:56,450
must be in support of the strategy

00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,670
because tactics without strategy is just

00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:01,370
busy work you know good process it's

00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:03,230
always in service of an outcome you know

00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,010
teams without tactics can't work

00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,930
effectively

00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:08,600
you know collaboration is hard and it

00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:10,250
only gets harder at scale so tactics are

00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,840
really like your team api's that help

00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:15,380
you manage your integration points

00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:18,110
between teams or now how do you

00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,940
determine the tactics well you know what

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,770
do you need to know to be effective what

00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,530
do you need to measure and how is this

00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:26,300
problem generally solved we really need

00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:28,910
to reinvent things in engineering teams

00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,950
but we do need to be selective process

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,510
should never be adopted wholesale mainly

00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:34,850
because it won't be adopted wholesale

00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:36,560
but often we can look at individual

00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:39,560
problems and find some standard ways to

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,840
address them now developers often talk

00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,400
about hating process but like I really

00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,410
think that developers secretly love

00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:50,030
process it's just when they love it they

00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:52,220
call it culture so you know instead of

00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:54,080
like what process do we need we can ask

00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,600
what kind of culture do we need to be

00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,760
successful you know and then we can try

00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,680
and build that culture so how can we

00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,480
build a culture of collaboration what

00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,300
would help stand up

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,740
pairing team calls whatever how can we

00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,760
build a culture that values

00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:13,040
users what would help use a research

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,320
support feedback and how can we build a

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,390
culture of sustainable delivery what

00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,580
would help regular releases

00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:24,649
retrospectives attention to defects and

00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:26,630
metrics so execution is the do now

00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:28,790
there's a manager joke that says if

00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:34,940
managers call people resources they can

00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:36,740
call you overhead but like the truth is

00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,570
that management is overhead because

00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,120
everything we do is in service of people

00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:42,800
getting stuff done because the execution

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,750
where we are is where progress is made

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,510
now without the other layers

00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:49,130
it's just activity but everything else

00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:53,060
without this means nothing because

00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:54,950
nothing happens so how do you just have

00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,959
in the execution well like this is the

00:11:54,950 --> 00:12:00,430
easiest one are there people doing

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:02,930
things and is it clear what needs done

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,100
so hopefully as I was talking you were

00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,440
seeing how this could apply to your

00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,540
teams and it's important to note that

00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,190
everything needs to fit together and few

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,440
teams do all of these things equally

00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:14,510
well now some people only value

00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,220
execution and on some level that's fair

00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:18,440
enough because it is the foundation for

00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,510
everything else but execution is most

00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,480
effective when it fits into a coherent

00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:25,040
whole now leaders often go to you what

00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,020
they're most comfortable with you know

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,579
we've all Matt and usually dislikes for

00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,860
the person with a new process for every

00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:33,740
occasion but on the other end of the

00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,300
scale normally also hated is the vision

00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,130
person who thinks that will answer the

00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,890
question once they determine it normally

00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:41,270
by themselves and this is not true like

00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,610
the other layers need to be there as

00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:45,350
well

00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:47,660
so I promised you four questions

00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,880
here they are and these don't map to the

00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:52,430
layers this is more of a grid because

00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,850
you can ask these at every level so the

00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:58,579
questions are how can I create clarity

00:12:54,850 --> 00:13:01,339
how can I create capacity what do I want

00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:03,730
to incentivize and what are my feedback

00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:03,730
loops

00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:12,170
so it's a quote by Tolstoy that says

00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:15,590
happy teams all alike every unhappy team

00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:17,930
is unhappy in its own way but like

00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:20,180
honestly I think this is bollocks like

00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:22,370
unhappy teams tend to be tediously

00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,380
predictable they're not delivering they

00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:27,470
feel like victims and they're just kind

00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:29,810
of lost so when you have a struggling

00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:31,970
question you know the first question is

00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:33,350
normally like where do I begin this is

00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:37,010
after you've got off the phone to your

00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:39,200
BFF going what have I done but the more

00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:43,550
helpful questions are how do I create

00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:45,170
clarity and how do I create capacity so

00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,420
every struggling Timo I've encountered

00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:49,580
seems to be experiencing some kind of

00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,890
existential crisis about who we are or

00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:54,740
what is our purpose you know the mission

00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:56,510
question essentially but as a pragmatist

00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,530
this often seems to be entirely behind

00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,930
beside the point

00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:01,540
you know if we're not shipping how much

00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:04,130
does it matter what we're not shipping

00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,990
how can we possibly know what we should

00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:07,250
be doing two or five years from now if

00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:10,910
we don't really know what we're doing

00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:13,820
today so here's the thing about the

00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:15,890
existential crisis it is comfortable and

00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,840
there's a team bonding experience

00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,470
because it usually unites them against a

00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,500
common enemy

00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:23,180
now who 90 against a common enemy is not

00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,240
like a team-building strategy that I

00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:29,750
would advocate for but you can't deny

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,400
it's like short-term effectiveness so no

00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,350
one in the team feels threatened by the

00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,870
existential crisis because it's likely

00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,640
somebody else's problem and everyone can

00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,050
have an opinion about it because it's

00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,630
abstract enough that most people won't

00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:43,310
actually have to do anything

00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:46,760
mission debates other bite shedding of

00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:48,590
team structure and purpose cloudy is

00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,150
harder because it's much more immediate

00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:52,250
and it has to be based on what's

00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:54,430
happening today which means you need to

00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:57,860
confront what's actually happening today

00:14:54,430 --> 00:15:00,620
there is no hiding behind lack of vision

00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,630
our teams delivering our projects

00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,370
drifting on and on with no end in sight

00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:07,180
are we doing things because they're

00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:09,950
interesting or because they're valuable

00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:12,170
now the more concrete we get the harder

00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,180
it is to get everybody in agreement you

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,160
know a wide range of opinions can find

00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,840
shelter in a broad fuzzy state mission

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,690
statement in a way that's not possible

00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,610
in an hour

00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:23,879
Claire one the kind that will articulate

00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:26,220
approximate objective for example now

00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:28,829
clarity involves hard conversations hard

00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:31,889
twists and defining first one then two

00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:33,240
then three steps ahead it's hard where

00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:36,569
it often looks small from the outside

00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:39,449
because it's no here no they're refining

00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:41,250
this we're finding that and it's often

00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:43,470
standing what at least some people

00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:45,389
believe to be true anyway such as what

00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,129
isn't going well or what the next step

00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:48,569
should be

00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:50,670
but it's really the most effective way

00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:55,139
I've found to get teamed to stop

00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:56,430
drifting and start delivering now what

00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:58,740
actions you might take to achieve

00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:00,660
clarity really depend on the team but

00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,220
you might take stock of all ongoing

00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,259
projects as well as the purpose and

00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,750
timeline for each one what's their

00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:08,250
strategic objective articulate the

00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,810
current priorities of the team the

00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,759
purpose of those priorities and the

00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:14,910
rationale between MIT behind making them

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,920
priorities clearly define the scope of

00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:20,160
upcoming milestones and every current or

00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,899
new project determine timeframes that

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,339
you can predict so you might say we're

00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:26,370
going to focus on media through the end

00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:28,050
of q4 and you can highlight the parallel

00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:30,600
work that determines what comes after

00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:32,819
that might work on making sure that

00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,029
project status is visible and the teams

00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:38,160
have visibility into each other's work

00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:40,199
so struggling teams also commonly suffer

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,089
from a sense of overload and often this

00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,630
is very unevenly distributed across the

00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:44,430
team

00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,870
some people are exceptionally relaxed

00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:48,689
and other people seem alarmingly

00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:50,130
overwhelmed if you view your team as a

00:16:48,689 --> 00:16:51,660
system you'll see where you have

00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,040
bottlenecks that if they were cleared

00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,740
they would increase the overall capacity

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,839
of the team so two books I really like

00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:01,709
on this a thinking in systems by Donella

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,180
Meadows and a beautiful constraint so

00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:05,339
what you might do depends on where the

00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,569
bottlenecks are right you might reduce

00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:08,640
the number of things that your team is

00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:09,449
taking on because too many people are

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,640
working alone

00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:13,770
you might take a more strategic approach

00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,150
to tackling inbound requests because you

00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,640
can't keep playing whack-a-mole

00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,470
you might realign people closer to the

00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,890
work that they want to do and give some

00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:24,480
people clear feedback because you need

00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:26,039
people in the right you need the right

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,299
people in the right roles and they'll be

00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:31,049
that much more effective if they

00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:31,900
actually enjoy it you might get the team

00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:33,490
to talk about

00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,530
lines and try and embrace continuous

00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,240
delivery because having that force only

00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:40,060
comes from coming from the outside is

00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,130
really destructive now if you manage

00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,870
managers improving them as leaders will

00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,850
always create capacity on your team

00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,500
their teams will get better you can rely

00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:50,230
on them more and delegate to them more

00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,030
and sometimes I think it feels like we

00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:55,150
don't have time to coach the people

00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:59,110
around us but medium term not even long

00:17:55,150 --> 00:18:00,100
term we don't have time not to so you

00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,720
could always come back to these

00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,240
questions because the answers change

00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,610
over time there is always a bottleneck

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,550
and some level of confusion is just part

00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:10,600
of that ambiguity of human communication

00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:12,370
you need to make sure that you're not

00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,110
staying where you're comfortable you

00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:15,940
know there's a different answer at it

00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,590
every different layer and the question

00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,290
the meta question is what is most

00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:22,390
pressing and it's also worth noting that

00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:24,040
sometimes you do the work yourself and

00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:26,520
sometimes you encourage other people to

00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,520
do the work

00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:38,049
so it wouldn't be a inspirational tack

00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:40,690
talk without this quote which is if you

00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:44,979
want to go fast go alone if you want to

00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:46,659
go far go together and I think about

00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:49,629
this in terms of the next two questions

00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:52,359
what am i incentivizing and what are my

00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:54,970
feedback loops so there's a concept of

00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:56,859
self managing teams which I really

00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,710
prefer to reframe is self improving

00:18:56,859 --> 00:19:01,179
teams self improving teams have feedback

00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:02,409
loops that make getting better over time

00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:04,179
a team effort

00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:05,519
you know they respond well to failure

00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:07,960
they learn as much from it as possible

00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,249
they use estimation there's a better way

00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,009
to surface the known and unknown

00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:13,720
unknowns the investing collaboration

00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:17,200
that levels up individuals and the

00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,909
collectives now the question that might

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,590
emerge from this is like okay well if

00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:22,210
you have a self improving team like

00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:25,960
what's the point of a manager anyway on

00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:27,849
you redundant now which honestly I would

00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,379
take being able to let work less than 50

00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:33,549
hours a week so it's an aspirational

00:19:29,379 --> 00:19:35,499
goal but actually like I think it

00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:37,269
reframed the wall of a team lead as

00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:39,190
someone who enables the team and who

00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:41,499
acts as an accelerant and it means

00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:43,450
moving away from this need to control or

00:19:41,499 --> 00:19:46,119
feeling that the value you bring comes

00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:48,129
from the power you have and towards

00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:49,720
having a more of a coaching mindset you

00:19:48,129 --> 00:19:51,549
know and the acceptance that the value

00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,710
you bring is best shown in the output of

00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:55,720
the team and the team health rather than

00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:59,409
anything that you actively and obviously

00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:01,090
do now every new manager struggles to

00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:02,470
let go of the individual work that they

00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,769
were doing before and achieved

00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:07,450
presumably some level of mastery yeah

00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:08,919
it's really hard to enter this moment

00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,239
sir although you know it's pretty easy

00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:12,099
to claim it

00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:14,379
many managers talk about servant

00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:16,539
leadership which often just means that

00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:18,009
they're the doormat of their team I call

00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:19,869
this house servant leadership and

00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:23,799
sometimes yell at people you are not the

00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:27,159
house-elf of your team they respond well

00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:28,179
to this it's fine or the other thing it

00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,379
means is these managers are

00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:31,899
uncomfortable with the power they have

00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:33,489
you know because you cannot be the

00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:36,669
servant of people that you have power

00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:38,590
over managers can also use this as a

00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:40,330
ways as a reason to abdicate

00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:42,519
responsibility from the day-to-day of

00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:43,060
their team like responsibility can only

00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:45,430
be a

00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,780
rates of control or you know worse not

00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:49,230
even then and power without

00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:51,970
responsibility as a form of sociopathy

00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:54,130
now the best leaders manage multiple

00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:57,700
master multiple leadership styles and

00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:59,440
know when their best deployed when to

00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,930
take the hard line of the authoritative

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,940
stance when a situation is bad enough

00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,770
that a cursive style is necessary and

00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,830
when a team would benefit from someone

00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:10,840
setting the pace but they also know when

00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:13,570
to optimize for the increased buy-in of

00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,430
the democratic approach when a team

00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:17,140
needs an affiliated leader to help them

00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:18,520
bond and when showing up as a

00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,940
collaborator will get the best out of

00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,530
people and when somebody needs a coach

00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,900
now we all have our go to the default

00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:28,300
that we lean on but it's not appropriate

00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,890
for every occasion you know the more

00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,200
that we can build out our capabilities

00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:34,030
and different styles authentically and

00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,440
deploy them regularly the more

00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:38,740
versatility we have for different

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,330
situations the authoritarian leader who

00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,490
suddenly shows up as a coach is not

00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:44,290
going to be believed or trust it but the

00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,850
coaching leader who suddenly shows up as

00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:47,430
an authoritarian it's probably not going

00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:50,410
to be taken seriously

00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:51,760
now the self improving team is a place

00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,770
for the democratic and affiliative

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,140
styles but above all the manager is

00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:58,030
coach and collaborator now like all good

00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:00,790
coaches you want to ask your questions

00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:02,140
and like any good collaborator sometimes

00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:09,550
you need to get in there and provide

00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:11,920
some active help in almost every

00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:14,890
situation you'll get the behavior you

00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,810
incentivize if you say you value

00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:18,450
feedback that you silence dissent

00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:21,520
you won't hear what people are thinking

00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:23,920
if you say you've only simplicity in the

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,020
user experience but you promote people

00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,810
based on complexity you'll get a lot of

00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:30,700
complexity the gap between claimed

00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:34,720
values and natural incentives is

00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:36,700
organizational hypocrisy being clear

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,710
about incentives and rewarding the

00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,450
things that you want to see is key to

00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,550
making sure that teams are aligned if

00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:44,950
you want to incentivize collaboration

00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:46,780
you can't evaluate purely on individual

00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:48,700
metrics if you want to incentivize

00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,050
honesty you have to accept that

00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,760
sometimes you're gonna hear things that

00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:55,120
you don't necessarily like who agree

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,710
with or that you don't want to hear if

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,240
you want to deliver user value

00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,760
you need to make sure that you recognize

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,530
that work now the role of a manager in a

00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,760
self-improving team is to ensure the

00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:08,860
incentives aligned with team improvement

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,780
now people only improve consistently if

00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:13,450
they get feedback so feedback loops

00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,950
should be one type and too positive this

00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:16,540
doesn't just mean feedback on what they

00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,700
can do better and like feedback is just

00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:20,020
your work reflected back to you so it's

00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,310
important that people see whether they

00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,760
can do better but it's important that

00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:26,230
they also see what they're doing well

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,640
making sure that people get consistent

00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:32,650
feedback and appreciation and incentive

00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:35,050
it's really important and giving people

00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:38,500
only constructive or worse negative

00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:40,300
feedback will cause them to avoid you so

00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,770
if we launch a new feature and we want

00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,060
to set up feedback loops around if

00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,920
something goes wrong you know like

00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:47,170
monitoring for downtime support volume

00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,790
you know but we also want to set up the

00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:52,240
feedback loops for what we expect to go

00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:53,590
right like usage positive feedback now

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,750
the role of a manager in the

00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:57,160
self-improving team is to build and

00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:01,870
contribute to healthy productive

00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:03,970
feedback cycles now you will get what

00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:06,910
you incentivize and it really does not

00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:08,590
matter how you feel about that a friend

00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:10,600
told me recently about a company that

00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:12,160
was no longer celebrating promotions

00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,390
because they don't want people to be so

00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:17,050
focused on them anymore

00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:18,640
and I was like cool if you created that

00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:22,680
kind of culture that celebration is

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:25,300
probably the least of it now a good team

00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,710
has strong and coherent communication

00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,930
you know this is a product of

00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:30,220
psychological safety as is the ability

00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:32,950
to treat failure was a learning

00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:35,050
opportunity they have a good idea of

00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:37,990
what can be done and how this is how

00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:39,970
teams ship regularly and they understand

00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:42,130
why things should be done and also why

00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:45,070
they shouldn't you know they make active

00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:47,320
decisions they have aligned incentives

00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:48,910
and strong feedback cycles this allows

00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,770
developing people within the team

00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:55,000
growing the team and creating more

00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:58,500
opportunity for others so your team like

00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:02,410
my team well they're probably fine right

00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:04,510
they can probably be about it too now

00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:06,100
the world of open source often seems a

00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:08,610
lot messier than the world of companies

00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:10,170
there are many things that I love

00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:12,510
our open source but the thing that I

00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:14,160
find hardest to deal with is sometimes

00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:16,470
it feels like there's this incentive to

00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,790
complain and tear people down that can

00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:20,400
drown out every with everybody

00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:22,559
everything else it's like people forget

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,770
that there's other human beings on like

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:28,049
on the end reading their comments and it

00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:29,910
might seem in this context that it's

00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:31,320
hard to take these ideas and fit them

00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:34,980
into the work that we do in an open

00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:36,390
source context I think there that when

00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,580
we remove the standard lovers of

00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:41,280
capitalism you know we find the human

00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:43,260
aspect that much more important you

00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,520
can't get people to contribute if they

00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,220
don't know what they're contributing to

00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:50,010
you if they don't see the markers of

00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:53,429
progress and if they don't see how to do

00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:55,350
it so contributor events are our

00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:57,750
opportunity to remind ourselves that all

00:25:55,350 --> 00:26:00,419
software open-source software included

00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:02,040
is built by humans and their group of

00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:05,190
people in this room are many people

00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:07,140
outside of it are a team so I want to

00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:09,030
think you leave you thinking about these

00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:12,840
four layers as they apply to the Fedora

00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:16,830
project what's the mission what's the

00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:20,490
strategy what are your tactics and how

00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:22,610
are you executing and I want to invite

00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:26,640
you to ask you two other these questions

00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:31,370
how can we create clarity how can we

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:35,640
create capacity what do we incentivize

00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:37,770
how are our feedback loops and I'll be

00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,000
here through tomorrow so come and tell

00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:41,540
me your answers because I'd really love

00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,540
to get to know you

00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:49,700
[Applause]

00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:49,700
[Music]

00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:55,010
I'm sorry I didn't talk for an hour but

00:26:53,630 --> 00:27:02,090
I don't think anybody wants to hear

00:26:55,010 --> 00:27:04,429
anyone talk for an hour yeah I'm happy

00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:06,020
to take any questions if anyone had a

00:27:04,429 --> 00:27:13,390
favorite with khun slide we can just go

00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:13,390
back and admire it yeah

00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:24,350
yeah so I think that's where like the

00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:26,870
theming can be really helpful oh sorry

00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:28,880
so it was is there any advice on how to

00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:32,720
create teams because a lot of teams in

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,250
Fedora are teams of one which like you

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,050
know so automatic also comes from this

00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:38,690
very open source context and this is

00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:40,490
something like I found a lot there as

00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:45,320
well and I think is also true of the

00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:47,810
WordPress community so teams of one like

00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,130
there is no team of one you know and it

00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:51,470
kind of sucks to be a team of one

00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:54,620
because you have to do everything you're

00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:57,860
the bottleneck of the team and you know

00:27:54,620 --> 00:28:00,320
if you're sick or busy or whatever like

00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:02,930
everything just stops you know and so

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,640
this is where I think theming is really

00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:07,160
helpful because even when you have

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,290
smaller projects that you know are maybe

00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:11,390
just one person projects people can come

00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:13,970
together is working under a coherent

00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:15,890
theme and so if there's way to group

00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:17,900
things and just declare that there will

00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:20,840
be no more teams of one and find a way

00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:22,580
to group everyone with somebody else and

00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,680
then they will probably come together

00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:27,710
over time especially if you can find

00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,330
more ways to collaborate but I get that

00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:34,030
it's really hard this is still like an

00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:34,030
ongoing thing Ford's automatic to you

00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,490
anything else

00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:51,610
[Applause]

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,179
yeah sure we have one more question no

00:28:51,610 --> 00:29:02,169
it's fine

00:28:52,179 --> 00:29:03,880
oh I love this question okay so is there

00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:06,039
a point at which a team is too

00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:09,760
dysfunctional to continue recognizably

00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:11,559
as a team absolutely yes and if that's

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,299
the case you really have to understand

00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:18,100
why it is and probably somebody needs to

00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:20,620
be fired like bluntly like I mean if you

00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:22,570
think about like humans in general like

00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,460
especially kind of software engineers

00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:25,929
like you people get into this field

00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,490
either because they love it or what they

00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:28,539
want to make a good amount of money and

00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:31,600
I think both of these are very

00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:33,549
legitimate reasons but like people

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,080
driven by those things like they don't

00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:36,820
want to fail like they don't want to

00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,100
suck like people in general I think

00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:40,659
don't want to fail and so if you have a

00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:43,090
group of people that is failing that

00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:45,220
badly like you need to understand why it

00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:47,740
is and the most common reason is that

00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:50,919
there was one or more extremely toxic

00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:52,990
people who see success you know is

00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:55,750
tearing other people down or creating

00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:57,549
some kind of really corrosive ly bad

00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:59,770
environment and so like those people

00:29:57,549 --> 00:30:01,270
need to go because otherwise you cannot

00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:04,419
have a functional team and wherever they

00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:08,020
go they will create dysfunction until

00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:10,049
they get a lot of therapy any other

00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:12,610
questions

00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:16,179
no cool well it's great to end on that

00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:17,770
high note of firing people thank you so

00:30:16,179 --> 00:30:19,840
much for having me and thanks Ben for

00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:21,780
inviting me it's really my privilege to

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,299
be here

00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:25,299
