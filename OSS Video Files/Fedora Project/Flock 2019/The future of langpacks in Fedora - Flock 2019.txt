In this session we will brainstorm the present and future of langpacks in Fedora.With the advent of containers, cloud images, flatpaks, and Silverblue, the need for a more modular OS is increasing and this also applies to the evolving handling of langpacks. Langpacks are no longer just translations but also include locales, fonts, input methods, as well as dictionaries etc. The i18n UX will need to balance what is pre- and post-installed.
