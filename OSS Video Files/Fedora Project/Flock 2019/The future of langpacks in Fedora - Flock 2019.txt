Title: The future of langpacks in Fedora - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-09-02
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	Jens Peteren, Parag Nemade, Alexander Bokovoy, Sundeep Anand, Mike Fabian

In this session we will brainstorm the present and future of langpacks in Fedora.With the advent of containers, cloud images, flatpaks, and Silverblue, the need for a more modular OS is increasing and this also applies to the evolving handling of langpacks. Langpacks are no longer just translations but also include locales, fonts, input methods, as well as dictionaries etc. The i18n UX will need to balance what is pre- and post-installed.

so welcome hope you can hear me okay

00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:09,990
sometimes I struggle with microphones

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,620
and volume and stuff so if you can't

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:22,770
hear me just shout out so welcome to

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:24,480
this session on line packs so a little

00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,760
bit of background I mean I think we have

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,099
quite good internationalization support

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:34,589
in fedora for quite a long time now for

00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:36,539
a long time fedora we install quite good

00:00:34,589 --> 00:00:42,929
fun coverage and input methods by

00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:44,969
default so it's very friendly operating

00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:49,819
system for international users overall

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:52,799
and what had has an internationalization

00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:54,359
engineering team so we've been kind of

00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:59,760
focusing on that for a long time also

00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:04,229
and at the same time now things are

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:09,060
changing quite a lot the world of

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:11,280
containers and modularity and different

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,580
editions and different spins different

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,730
requirements and like in the past we

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,550
also had a different localized spins of

00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:26,910
fedora

00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:30,980
and one example is some of our fonts

00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:34,800
firstly some of our East Asian fonts are

00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:37,050
quite large and so sometimes this is

00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:40,260
coming up like I don't know if it's

00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:43,050
something we can do to make our

00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,760
installation more flexible so that if

00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:51,960
someone wants a very small footprint and

00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:54,540
they can still do that so this this talk

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,060
or presentation or session or discussion

00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,380
I'm hoping it'll be but interactive and

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,820
people will interject questions and also

00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:06,540
actually we don't have I don't have a

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:10,319
lot of slides and demo some stuff but

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,760
overall it's ready to try and get ideas

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,799
and feedback

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:19,500
the discussion about the future

00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:22,980
direction so we I don't know the basis I

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:27,590
told him three parts well the slightest

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,590
bit about the past present and future

00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,849
actually made some progress on this over

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:39,859
the last few years

00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:39,859
Michael change from young to DNF and

00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,549
weak dependencies and so on so already

00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:48,329
now we have various things in place that

00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:51,180
allow installation of blank packs and so

00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:57,000
on and even funds now and also even

00:02:51,180 --> 00:03:02,670
input methods and I think we're gonna

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,370
take this further so so yeah locales may

00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:07,440
be the most for the wider Fedora for the

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,120
locales sub packaging in which we were

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,810
also involved in which may be the

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:16,069
biggest well sometimes the most impact

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:18,690
in terms of containers and so on but um

00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:27,540
but it also affects many other things

00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:29,310
like toolbox and things like that so

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:33,389
maybe the first thing is what is a line

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:35,340
pack I mean traditionally I at least

00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:40,379
thought of line packs only as being like

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:42,569
translation bundles but maybe that's

00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:44,400
still true in some sense but we've sort

00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:46,440
of taken this a bit extended this now

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,329
also to include things like locales and

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:52,530
fonts even input methods and so on so

00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:57,949
these were all kind of handing these now

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,949
within this sole impact framework

00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:13,930
so how did things evolve the first bit

00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:16,090
about the past a lot long ago in the

00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:20,049
comps hope most of you are familiar with

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:22,570
Fedora comps so basically it sort of

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:27,090
packaged groups and for a long time we

00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:29,830
had different support groups for each

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:32,349
language so each each language had its

00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,900
own so like there was a French support

00:04:32,349 --> 00:04:36,729
German support Hungarians pro-japanese

00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,590
support and and then we'd listed

00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:42,400
relevant packages some of them

00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:44,740
conditional and so on in those well in

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:52,180
those groups at MIT it's an XML file and

00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:53,770
anyway but and that was okay I think

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,710
finally now we've got rid of all those

00:04:53,770 --> 00:05:00,360
language groups because actually they

00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:03,220
weren't being well they could only be

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:08,560
after they could only be installed

00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:10,270
manually by hand the Installer and yeah

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,449
other tools we're not really using those

00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:17,919
anymore so to avoid kind of duplication

00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:20,199
or confusion we got rid of those and

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,539
then at a later stage there was this

00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,610
special section in camps called Lang

00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:26,620
packs which was basically for

00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:30,960
installation of translation like things

00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:33,570
like Libre Office translations man pages

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,419
dictionaries and so on so that was

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:48,099
handled by some globbing and so on in

00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:52,539
that section and there was the yum yum

00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:55,509
lang packs was a kind of extension to

00:05:52,539 --> 00:06:02,729
yum which allowed to inject these Lang

00:05:55,509 --> 00:06:02,729
packs into RPM transactions and so on

00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:09,780
but that didn't work with DNF

00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:27,100
I don't really want to talk about this

00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:36,790
point anything so previously the land

00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:39,580
backs were used by the pumps so in 29

00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:43,450
release comes fine so come spine is

00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:46,060
having these section line packs so where

00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:55,150
the definitions of this land back

00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:58,000
packages yeah so so this section

00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:01,450
basically it defines what Lange packs

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,820
are in the palms file so how this

00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:06,310
section is defined like there is one

00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:12,550
base package and the base package name

00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:15,010
is written on the right side so if you

00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:17,320
want to install a liberal slang pack

00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:18,910
your system should be having this

00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,860
liberal hop this happen core package

00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,900
installed on your system so that's a

00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,360
prior requirement so likewise these

00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:28,660
mappings are defined in this line pack

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,280
section in coms file so if if your if

00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,200
your system is already having the

00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,060
Liberal Peace Corps package installed on

00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,580
your system then whenever a new

00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:39,820
transaction will happen on your system

00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:42,780
through yum or through Jung it will

00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:45,250
automatically check if the respective

00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:48,430
libreoffice Lang PAC package for the

00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:52,390
default locale that you are using is

00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:55,290
available in the repository or not so if

00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:58,570
it finds that that package is available

00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:00,760
then it will just pull that package into

00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:03,070
the running transaction and it will

00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,110
install it so this transaction can be

00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:09,130
you are just regularly updating your

00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:12,490
system yum update or you can explicitly

00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:13,960
just updating a libreoffice packages so

00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,090
it will automatically find the

00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,270
respective Lang PAC package and pull it

00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:22,570
so this was what happening when yum was

00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,230
there and this how Jung was using this

00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,090
lang

00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:31,770
concept so this was the very first

00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:37,169
concept of dislike packs in fedora then

00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:37,169
there was also group section was there

00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:51,910
so groups so incomes also we have these

00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:53,980
groups are defined by language names so

00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:56,080
you can even install directly this

00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:59,170
language by saying that young group

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,540
installed Japanese support so by that

00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:04,660
also you used to get the related

00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,910
packages to your language and here the

00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:10,180
definition was like type the conditional

00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:12,730
so conditional means if this package X

00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,040
or X 11 sir server X or was already

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:17,080
installed then there and then only it's

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,690
going to pull diverse kkc on your system

00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:22,810
so likewise is the definition written in

00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:25,420
this coms file so you can directly even

00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:28,450
use to install the language supports

00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:36,220
using the group group concept of yem so

00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:39,790
this was the it was it was a need arise

00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:42,280
that we should have a plugins that that

00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:45,910
can be that can automate this Lang by

00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:48,190
installations so a young plug-in written

00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:50,800
in Python language that used to pass

00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:59,290
this coms file really the Lang back

00:09:50,800 --> 00:10:01,380
section and yeah so and then the same

00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:05,170
thing that what I have explained you

00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:07,300
just before that it just reads if that

00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,750
base package is already in the

00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:12,490
transaction then it pulls the respect to

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,880
land back package so this was the second

00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:20,650
thing in this Lang packs develop

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:24,580
evolution okay then at the time of

00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:29,230
Fedora 21 DNA become the default

00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:31,750
installer package manager okay so then

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:34,360
what happens that this young Lang back

00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,100
pocket plugin become incompatible with

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,009
the T

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,110
so we tried to migrate the young land

00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:42,899
back plug into the DNA flanker chlorine

00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:45,929
so we introduced a DNF lang packs Python

00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:48,149
package to the users and it worked the

00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:50,160
similar way the young lankeshwar used to

00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:54,149
work through the coms file section okay

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:57,660
but then again we found that there is no

00:10:54,149 --> 00:11:01,230
way to auto install the packages okay

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:05,040
so then this concept was developed like

00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:08,549
we should have a meta packages okay so

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,129
we directly tell the Dean of that just

00:11:08,549 --> 00:11:13,290
install an packs - job package and then

00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:15,480
Lang packs - job whenever it comes into

00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:17,129
the DNF transaction it will pull the

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,470
necessary dependencies of that

00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:20,759
particular language so this was the

00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:26,369
thing that got developed

00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:32,429
I have this wiki page a small wiki page

00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:33,839
like C so during the federal thirteen

00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:36,660
we'll introduce the young LAN pack

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:40,559
plug-in then in federal 22 we introduced

00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:42,959
a DNA plugin then these are the some of

00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:45,809
the extra links that I am keeping on

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,879
this page then in federal 24 we

00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:51,929
introduced the installation with rpm

00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:57,240
with dependency so what was this change

00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:59,579
that we utilize the RPM tags so rpm by

00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,189
that time got these tags like a weak

00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:05,579
dependencies so weak dependencies are

00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:08,399
kind of a dependencies whereby if

00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:10,619
suppose some base packages already

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,470
installed on your system you can pool

00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:16,740
the respect to language packages using

00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:20,980
that base package name okay so we are

00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:25,960
not using the coms here we are totally

00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:31,010
going away from the comps file okay so

00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:33,800
this thing got introduced and we added a

00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:35,960
new package for land packs package and

00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,270
this Lange pack package then started

00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,550
providing a different different sub

00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:42,440
packages per language like Lang packs as

00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:45,020
language are for different different

00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,450
partitions and then we said these

00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:50,620
different different land pack packages

00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:54,140
to pull the respective language packages

00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:56,810
okay this was the concept that we

00:12:54,140 --> 00:13:02,210
introduced in this change and this

00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:06,160
change was introducing federal 24 now

00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:08,930
what advantage we got that we got a

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,000
particular meta package that should get

00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:14,390
pulled into the initial anaconda

00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,880
installation so we just requested the

00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:19,520
Anaconda team to add the code so that

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:23,029
whenever a user selects that I want to

00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:25,339
install in Japanese that Lang packs -

00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:27,530
jar meta package will automatically get

00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:30,050
selected into the initial transaction

00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:32,210
and then based on whatever the base

00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:34,790
packages are already included in that

00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:36,650
transaction it tried to pull the

00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:39,530
respective language packages like

00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:43,010
suppose if the initial transaction of

00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:45,560
the fedora 25 installation contains man

00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:47,750
pages as a base package and you have

00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,750
selected to install in Japanese language

00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:53,150
then it automatically picks the man

00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:57,589
pages - job package into the initial

00:13:53,150 --> 00:14:00,980
transaction so this was the thing that

00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:04,250
was introduced there but I think there

00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:08,360
was some incompatibility keep coming

00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:11,420
with anaconda that prevented to install

00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:14,360
these packages and then I think we

00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:17,000
totally removed

00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,520
I also concept DVD also concept from the

00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,610
workstation restoration introduced the

00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:25,580
lye also concept so that also created a

00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:28,850
problem for us because this this meta

00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:31,430
packages only work if the package the

00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,090
actual package present in your media or

00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:35,060
not

00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:37,220
it was not there so we again got stuck I

00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:41,210
mean what what next to introduce for the

00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:48,740
lang packs so we keep thinking on that

00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:51,860
and we then thought that genome software

00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:54,380
is one of the veil where we can try to

00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,810
pull these packages automatically so I

00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:59,870
think that's a different discussion that

00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:02,450
Sandeep Annan will continue let me

00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:05,840
continue with the lang packs changes how

00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:18,590
it got evolve so this change we

00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:21,620
introduced yeah so in Fedora 30 then we

00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:24,050
decided that we will totally remove the

00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:26,900
language support concept from the coms

00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:29,750
file and let the users totally move to

00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,700
using this meta packages so this was

00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,290
just small change we introduced into the

00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,710
federal authority and we just removed

00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:40,430
the comes comes entries for the

00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:43,610
individual languages and just let the

00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:47,180
users directly use the lang packs - that

00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:49,730
particular Lang core packages in this

00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:53,390
current federal 31 release we added

00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:56,660
another change to the Lang packs whereby

00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:59,030
we split the lamp packs meta packages

00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:01,850
into the two packages like if there is a

00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:04,760
lamb packs - jar package it caught spilt

00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:07,910
into the lamb packs - cor - jar and life

00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:10,970
packs - job now what will happen if you

00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:13,490
just install a LAN packs - over - JA it

00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:16,100
will ensure that your system will resume

00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:19,040
at least one default font and one I am e

00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:21,140
input method so that we have ensured

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,650
while splitting this lamb packs meta

00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,650
packages

00:16:25,299 --> 00:16:33,519
input method like Ibis kkc for jobless

00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,919
[Music]

00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:59,700
see so when you try to install an pax

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,790
happen job it is trying to install the

00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:04,230
base installing the requested package

00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,549
Lang packs happen JA and then the

00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:09,829
dependencies these are the weak

00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:13,079
dependencies that are given at the end

00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:15,329
so we have introduced this Google notice

00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:18,270
AFC changer TTC fonts as a default font

00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:19,920
and then this as I told you libre office

00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:22,530
core is already installed on my system

00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:25,110
so it tried to pull the help jar Lang

00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:29,220
pack jar and man pages was also there

00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:31,919
installed so it so this is how I mean

00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:36,150
when you try to install a single package

00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:41,970
it will pull the dependencies related to

00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:49,740
that language on your system I think

00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:52,500
it's already actually I noticed this

00:17:49,740 --> 00:18:04,410
problem in toolbox so I need to check on

00:17:52,500 --> 00:18:10,130
that right right for Ibis kkc hyper is a

00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:10,130
base package let me check

00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:18,240
no it's not there so I mean if I was

00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:21,020
having an Ibis it would have pulled Ibis

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,020
kkc as well

00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:55,110
so see like core

00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:59,490
so I'm trying for Odia language lang

00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:02,190
packs - core happen over so it is trying

00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:04,650
to install the font package only and not

00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,450
the IME because again the Ibis is not

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:09,720
there otherwise it would have pooled

00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:13,800
Ibis - m79 package we could being this

00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:16,890
Indic languages 17 in key maps as i am e

00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,390
so if Ibis was there I was am certain

00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,190
you would have get installed in this

00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:23,790
transaction only but it is only

00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:25,890
installing the default font and if I

00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:27,930
switch this command to install the

00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:30,900
complete line packs package for the

00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:40,890
Oriya language then these are the number

00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:43,280
of packages that get pulled into the it

00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,280
is there

00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:49,950
yeah that's something we are dealing

00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:56,190
with the GFC people currently we have

00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:58,170
the bug open yeah yes yes and that's why

00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:01,110
we requested I mean we need to discuss

00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:04,370
with the GFC team and request them that

00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:09,090
let us allow to install it as a default

00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:29,490
gilepsy local so that something is going

00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:32,670
on still in discussion for a tenant

00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:35,160
functionality so core packages will

00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:40,890
ensure one font and one I am me for your

00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:44,430
language at least okay so that was the

00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:48,870
present so the TNF just recapping what

00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:51,530
part the TNF rich and weak dependencies

00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:55,340
that were using for

00:20:51,530 --> 00:21:00,590
I'm pack installation and this new metal

00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:03,710
packages that we have so I talked a

00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:10,490
little bit about I mentioned gilepsy

00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:13,820
earlier and so for locales actually

00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:15,640
might might be zesty more well mike is

00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:18,130
actually working upstream gilepsy

00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,020
locales and things so probably should

00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:22,760
say some words too but just I was just

00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:30,230
more about the packaging side on the

00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:41,480
gypsy side so firstly it was - well

00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:45,140
again ellipses spec file awhile ago he

00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,880
made some changes that sub packages are

00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:50,120
created for the different languages

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,500
originally there was only one gilepsy

00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:56,750
common file which contained user lip

00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,820
locale archive that was a huge file

00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:01,040
something like hundred five megabytes

00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,790
which had locates for all language since

00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,610
you couldn't

00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:08,360
strip it down I want only French and I

00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:10,130
don't care for the rest and so we did

00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,920
some changes to the spec file that the

00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:15,230
spec file has auto-generated parts with

00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:18,260
Lua scripts which generates sub packages

00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:21,440
for each language and now you can still

00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:23,810
install a gilepsy or link pack to get

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,180
the big blob for everything but you can

00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:28,340
also install individual packages for

00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:31,190
individual languages if you want to save

00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:35,300
space if you install all individual

00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:37,340
packages you have more data overall on

00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,440
your hard disk because the archive is

00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,480
more efficient but if you only need a

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,920
few then it's better to install the

00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,650
individual package so now you have a

00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:49,490
choice the choice has become more

00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:52,520
important because the archive has about

00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:55,010
doubled in size is now about two hundred

00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:57,710
ten megabytes because I

00:22:55,010 --> 00:23:00,350
one year ago I updated the sorting

00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:03,980
algorithms algorithm to a newer version

00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:06,940
of Unicode and because lots of care

00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:10,220
have been added to Unicode that and

00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:12,890
unfortunately the default Unicode

00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:15,410
collation order is duplicated in every

00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:16,400
locale this cannot be shared not even if

00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:18,620
you use the archive

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:22,730
that's a gilepsy limitation at the

00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:24,970
moment so that made it even more

00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:28,070
important to be able to install

00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:32,419
individual locales and now as Park has

00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:35,210
said this something like G Lipsey Lang

00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:37,070
Peck fr needs to be pulled in when you

00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,429
install this meta package for length

00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,370
pecks

00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:42,530
and because of the split into the

00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:44,450
Olympics in Olympic score something

00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:49,700
needs to be done with the dependencies

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:53,390
and ellipses Peck file I think I need to

00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:55,250
do that soon after this conference it

00:23:53,390 --> 00:24:06,309
should be pretty easy I think that's

00:23:55,250 --> 00:24:10,160
about it so there's one more package

00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:16,190
does this W package they have just like

00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:18,440
a minimal package has anyone from G team

00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:22,190
here but I don't know I kind of proposed

00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,660
in its related bugzilla ticket whether

00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,520
that package cannot be dropped so I

00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:32,559
don't really see it it's much purchased

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:32,559
but anyway I could just do a very small

00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:46,280
this is actually fit also the blue

00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,470
[Music]

00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:20,650
so this is yes I'm currently using en-gb

00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:26,860
inseparably we have the big all also

00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:29,280
workstation we have the is all lang PACs

00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:32,940
archive so it basically contains all the

00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:37,680
all the tipsy locales by default

00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,680
obviously if you want you can replace it

00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:57,730
860 I'm now in fedora based container

00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:02,650
we've dropped

00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:04,510
we recently the en us was dropped

00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:06,720
I'm the English locales are no longer

00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:10,960
installed by default only

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:14,920
cidade utf-8 so that's that's good I

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:18,390
think that reduced the size by maybe

00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:18,390
five six megabytes or something

00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:46,990
and this also reflected now in fedora

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:50,140
toolbox - so the latest alarm for 3331 -

00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:53,470
box containers also you have to utf-8 so

00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:55,330
it so it's a small well small change so

00:26:53,470 --> 00:27:00,669
it may affect some users so but

00:26:55,330 --> 00:27:08,919
obviously you can easily install the

00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:12,490
locales if you if you wish for them so I

00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:15,240
heard Carlos talking about that too but

00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:22,150
I think it's not so serious

00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:27,240
okay yeah I think this image only when

00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:27,240
stable two days ago maybe something so

00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:39,309
yeah occasion you may get some Hotel

00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:40,360
warnings wait is this when you're

00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:42,580
running some application is something

00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:45,280
that's expected to run in a different

00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:48,010
locale something but anyway I think it's

00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:59,520
pretty easy to solve and it makes a very

00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:59,520
small basic image okay okay

00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:04,679
any questions or comments on this point

00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:32,930
yeah something is gonna talk about

00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:40,070
academic don't suffer so this is this is

00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:42,430
Fedora 30 so just before so currently if

00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:45,500
you want to have nine packs installed in

00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:51,110
I'm software are you gonna talk about

00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:53,300
this or not status quo okay yeah okay

00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:56,750
then just I just wanted to show you how

00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:58,250
things look right now see if you can

00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:05,690
still search for something like that

00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:08,870
which or I don't know then this this

00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:11,330
thing appears and then so so it is

00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:14,420
possible to install these metal packages

00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:17,000
Pike was talking about Engram software

00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:21,400
I'm not gonna do this now in silica sort

00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:24,880
of to reboot to get it to appear but

00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,880
alright so that's

00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:40,339
[Music]

00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:59,159
yeah thirty-eight more just all right

00:29:48,330 --> 00:30:04,500
anyway um maybe I'll come back to flat

00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:06,929
packs later if we have time I think I

00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:13,889
already talked about this so I can

00:30:06,929 --> 00:30:15,659
probably skip this actually we were

00:30:13,889 --> 00:30:18,240
working with genomes office so that we

00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:23,059
can have Auto installation of long pack

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,059
meta packages so I can show small

00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:31,549
currently we are in simplified Chinese

00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:37,620
and we have three language packs

00:30:35,549 --> 00:30:40,529
installed Brazilian Portuguese English

00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:46,289
and simplified Chinese now let's switch

00:30:40,529 --> 00:30:54,630
our language to some other local see we

00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:57,480
are selecting Japanese here we need to

00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:59,929
log off and log in again to get into

00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,929
Japanese

00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:18,290
right so this is a small screen for

00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:20,480
renaming some of the holders actually

00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:29,420
I'll be using my development environment

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:32,420
to showcase this so the code is coupled

00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:34,880
with auto updates from genome software

00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:37,700
so it will take a minute to start the

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:41,590
auto update thing and then we can see

00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,590
how language packs are getting installed

00:31:46,900 --> 00:32:05,810
actually actually no notification on no

00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:07,760
permission I mean no dialogue box box is

00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:10,880
there if you are selecting your language

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,560
in anaconda itself and logging in so the

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,200
first time genome software will check

00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:18,440
for updates it will install the language

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,110
pack behind the scenes automatically

00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:25,210
right exactly and this will happen for a

00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:25,210
language switch as well so both means

00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:34,250
currently no so this here we can see

00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:47,120
that language for Japanese has been

00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:55,220
installed so here we have made a package

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:58,370
installed see then it will it will I

00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:00,530
mean it does a lot of operations it it

00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:02,180
it in the background researches for the

00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:04,520
language pack and then for that

00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:08,710
particular local it installs the meta

00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,710
package so that's it

00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:14,009
[Applause]

00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:24,270
all right so just one thing like if if

00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:26,420
our user uninstalls the meta package by

00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:28,980
itself then this feature will not

00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:34,350
reinstall it I mean the user will

00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:39,870
manually install yeah that may make

00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:41,640
sense I mean I think we with well I

00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:43,650
think you've just mentioned but I'm the

00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:46,470
idea of this feature is to kind of

00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:49,770
parallel how anaconda does Network

00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:51,210
installs currently so currently if you

00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:53,520
do add Network install say of

00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:55,590
workstation or Fedora server then you

00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:59,250
will get the line packs installed

00:33:55,590 --> 00:34:01,890
automatically so the henrys experience

00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:07,650
we wanted was that so you do a live

00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:09,660
install of say workstation then it will

00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:11,070
then post install that line pack which

00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,350
would have been installed by the network

00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:16,500
installer automatically and they will do

00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:18,000
it after but I agree it would it

00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:21,360
wouldn't hurt to have a little pop up or

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,360
something and originally I had kind of

00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,250
envisaged that it would be it would be a

00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,470
semi manual process in the sense that it

00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:31,890
would be included in a drum software

00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:34,080
transaction like when you first boot up

00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:35,220
so after a fresh install and usually

00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,380
there are updates and then Gramps

00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:39,120
waffles are you have there are ten

00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,620
updates available or something and I

00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,960
knew and then one of those would be the

00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:45,210
LEM tags but anyway the way it's been

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,910
done now is that it's done automatic

00:34:45,210 --> 00:35:00,300
fashion we may evolve this more in the

00:34:47,910 --> 00:35:03,870
future yeah yeah anyway I'm something

00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:05,790
like well a moment where something I fit

00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:08,400
with our silver blue it would have to be

00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:09,870
a reboot anyway so that's still well was

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,810
this sort of things I could have wanted

00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:15,870
to cover in this exploratory part of the

00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:19,340
talk but um how we want to improve this

00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:19,340
least going forward

00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:29,319
so what yeah the only a few more

00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:30,490
slightest there's not much time so I can

00:35:29,319 --> 00:35:32,589
talk a little more but if people have

00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:58,690
questions we'd love to hear any feedback

00:35:32,589 --> 00:36:02,460
or thoughts some people have them para

00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:02,460
concurrent lossless

00:36:27,220 --> 00:37:24,490
I think the biggest change is that

00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:28,359
previously do something like to a group

00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:31,240
install of the elements a French support

00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:34,990
now instead you just install the lung

00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:47,190
packs fr conceptually that's the biggest

00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:47,190
change any other questions

00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:59,750
I could just say female works and so for

00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:01,850
funds currently we're installing so it's

00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:04,330
a bit like the locale situation that

00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:07,670
currently we install lots of locales

00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:11,570
lots of well quite good amount of fonts

00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:16,160
and also input methods by default so so

00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:17,930
one question is how I don't know another

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,110
option would be to install less stuff

00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:25,070
and then install post install more

00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:27,950
things later and there's a bit of risk

00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:29,480
in the sense that it does make it a bit

00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:33,140
more difficult for international users

00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:36,350
but it also makes may be the you know

00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:38,990
the image smaller to download and so on

00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:41,390
so the kind of pros and cons to this and

00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:45,890
I think something we need to evaluate

00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:47,690
going forward right do we want to only

00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:50,540
install a few little kills do we only

00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:52,520
want to install to run until less fonts

00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:56,650
that we've made some progress on the

00:38:52,520 --> 00:39:03,820
front side for Fedora 31 in a sense that

00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:07,100
it's now easy to get fonts installed

00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:08,720
afterwards if you adding or if you're in

00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:12,920
tool box for example currently toolbox

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:16,070
doesn't use just the host fonts so you

00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:19,040
have to install fonts into the toolbox

00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:21,170
if you want them and also one thing like

00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,140
we may want to do is to mount the system

00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:26,630
fonts into the toolbox which would solve

00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:29,170
a problem in some sense but however

00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:35,690
another way would be to leverage the

00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:37,910
Olympics for that and I think for

00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:40,760
informatics is less of an issue in some

00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:42,650
sense I mean first installing implement

00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:48,950
accessibility is not quite as big a deal

00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:51,680
I mean I mean I'm not having funds and

00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:55,250
locales is kind of a showstopper uh I

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,790
mean for basic kind of bootstrapping and

00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,790
so on so

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:09,000
you know after that the most

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,859
controversial thing is about

00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:15,490
translations and this is really a bit

00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:18,099
big and difficult Maivia turns quite

00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:20,560
simple but actually we saw a little bit

00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:25,300
about it in the past but the idea is

00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:28,619
that currently most fedora packages just

00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:31,270
bundle all their translations in it and

00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:36,310
so kind of ugly hacks where you maybe

00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:39,940
just exclude a tilapia and don't install

00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:44,260
translations for example and in fact I

00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:47,099
think this affects well I think it's

00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:49,210
going to be done for documentation but

00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:52,089
but it gets quite messy and then if you

00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:53,680
want to enable translations and you know

00:40:52,089 --> 00:40:55,270
I wasn't pretty neat to reinstall the

00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,170
package and so on so it's not very nice

00:40:55,270 --> 00:41:01,480
so an idea well it'd be nice if you

00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:03,580
could only install the translations you

00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,410
need rather than 50 different

00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:10,470
translations you probably only need one

00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:12,700
or two of those at maximum so yeah

00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:16,570
whether it should be done in some kind

00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:18,369
of enhancements to rpm or whether it

00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:19,990
should be done at the sort of build

00:41:18,369 --> 00:41:23,260

00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:41,040
