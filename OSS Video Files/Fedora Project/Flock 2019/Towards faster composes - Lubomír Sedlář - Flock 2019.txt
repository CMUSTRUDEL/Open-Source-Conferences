Title: Towards faster composes - Lubomír Sedlář - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-08-28
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	In this session I will talk about what is coming in the future for Pungi, the Fedora compose tool. Historically we have had issues with long compose times, and in this talk I want to explore some options for breaking the process into smaller chunks to enable faster iteration and delivery of consumable artifacts.
