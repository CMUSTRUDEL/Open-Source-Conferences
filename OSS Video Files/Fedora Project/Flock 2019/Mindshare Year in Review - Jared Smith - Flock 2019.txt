welcome to our mindshare year-in-review

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,459
just by way of announcement those who

00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:12,119
don't know me my name is jared smith

00:00:09,459 --> 00:00:14,019
i've been around for a little while

00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:18,759
normally you wouldn't see me up here

00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:20,349
unshaven but due to my second flock in a

00:00:18,759 --> 00:00:21,910
row or maybe third flock in a row i

00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:24,759
can't remember now without my baggage

00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:28,150
arriving when I arrived you get me as I

00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:30,400
am today so anyway I want to talk a

00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,720
little bit about mine share talk about

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,880
what it is and then what we've

00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,860
accomplished over the last year in a

00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,510
little bit so how many people have a

00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,160
good solid understanding of what the

00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:46,120
mind share committee actually is and

00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:48,100
what they do one cool good-o - yes I I

00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,430
hope you do too otherwise we're both in

00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,620
trouble so I want to spend a few minutes

00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,570
at the front end of the conversation

00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,830
talking about what is my cheer what are

00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,430
kind of our goals with my entire

00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:01,960
committee what we try to focus on and

00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,220
then talk about what we've accomplished

00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,390
because it doesn't make sense to talk

00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,680
about what we've accomplished if you

00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,650
don't understand what our goals and

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,910
ambitions are so the mind sheriff

00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,690
committee was formed what's have been

00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:16,680
two years ago now roughly almost but but

00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:19,300
really got kicked off in in full swing

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,140
about a year ago March when we had a

00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:25,090
fedora activity day and a fad meeting

00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,380
and we kind of kicked things up said

00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,760
what do we want to do what are we gonna

00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,080
try to accomplish what can we get done

00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,659
in the short term what a little more

00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,909
kind of medium term long term goals so

00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:37,200
to take a step back and explain what

00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:39,130
mine share the mind share committee is

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,960
when we're talking about kind of the

00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,520
organizational structure of Fedora we

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,420
have a Fedora project leader wave your

00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,979
hand Matthew and and not only is he the

00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,560
Fedora project leader but he's also the

00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:51,490
leader of the flora council right

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,229
Council makes all the big Heavy's

00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,690
decisions and has the long boring

00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:58,180
meetings that to get things done right

00:01:55,690 --> 00:02:00,580
and then underneath the fedora council

00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,960
there are two two major committees the

00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,430
one on the technical side of the house

00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,979
is called fess coats the Fedora

00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:07,360
engineering steering committee and they

00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:08,769
do all the technical stuff what's going

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,239
what features going into this new

00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:12,069
release of fedora how do we deal with

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,060
this technical problem you know those

00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:14,620
sorts of things so it's kind of the

00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,810
umbrella committee overall the technical

00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,310
things and all the cigs and special

00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,989
interest groups and secondary

00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,840
architectures and fun things like that

00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:25,090
all kind of roll up under fess Co on the

00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,620
other side of the house we have what we

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,989
call the mind share committee which is

00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:33,629
kind of the umbrella organization over

00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:35,680
things like you know outreach events

00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:40,120
communities you know the the comm ops

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,860
team documentation websites design kind

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,319
of the more human focused rather than

00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:47,890
technical focused side of the house that

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,140
make sense and so when we you know when

00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:52,000
when this mind share committee started

00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,680
up I you know there was a there are

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,410
several seats that are appointed you

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,150
know at the various groups but there's

00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,560
also a couple that are elected and I

00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,819
thought you know I've been on fest Co

00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,650
for a number of years I've done the

00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:05,379
technical side of things I was an FPL

00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,790
for a little while maybe I should you

00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:09,579
know mix things up a little bit and

00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,959
focus on the kind of the human element

00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:13,359
of this rather than just on the

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,760
technical so I ran for the mind sure

00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,599
committee somehow got elected and that's

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,910
why I'm here today

00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:20,980
so really mindshare focuses like I said

00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:25,209
on the on the human outreach marketing

00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:27,669
design websites Docs badges comm ops the

00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:31,419
ambassador's program events that sort of

00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:33,700
thing and more than anything else I

00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:35,230
think our our first year and little year

00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,079
in a little bit now you know counting

00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:41,650
from last March is really in getting

00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:43,299
organized making sure we have documented

00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,889
processes for how are we going to

00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:47,169
approve such as such a thing or how do

00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:49,060
we want to approach these sorts of

00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:50,889
things we've tried really hard at

00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,650
increasing communications now that's not

00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:54,819
always easy especially when you know the

00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,260
people who serve on the mindshare

00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:59,560
committee are already very very busy

00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,760
doing other things and you know there's

00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,959
an old adage that says if you want to

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,280
get something done give it to a busy

00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:04,629
person because they'll be organized

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,400
enough to get it done now we haven't

00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:08,799
completely done that but we have tried

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,810
very hard to despite our crazy busy

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,280
schedules amongst all of us to increase

00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,290
communication between the teams whether

00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,320
that's the marketing team or the docs

00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,639
team or the badges or the ambassadors

00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,910
program or or these sorts of things

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,729
increased communication and then trying

00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:27,460
to improve the process trying to you

00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:28,290
know to get things as things moving

00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,090
better

00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:32,400
and also you know just reduce some of

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,680
those pain points I'll talk more about

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,840
that in a minute when we talk about the

00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,340
ambassador's program having been a

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,050
Fedora project leader I know where some

00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,790
of the pain points in Fedora are I know

00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,560
where some of the conversations at the

00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,750
end of every fudk honor flock are gonna

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,860
be and and we're trying on the mind

00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,270
chair committee to say hey what are

00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,090
those pain points how can we address

00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:53,760
those so we'll get into that in a minute

00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:57,390
that being said it's been a very very

00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,860
fast year a year in three months it

00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:01,280
feels at least to me like it's just

00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,020
absolutely flown by and so let's get

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,580
let's talk about some of the things

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,890
we've done but before I do that I just

00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,360
want to talk about that this is still a

00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,670
work in progress we still have many

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,800
things we'd like to do we still want to

00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:15,330
get more community involvement we get

00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,740
want to get more of you understanding

00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:20,070
what we're doing and then involved in

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,890
what we're doing so it is very much a

00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:26,190
work in progress I think the first thing

00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:28,110
that we've done is taken and maybe a

00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:30,870
slightly different approach than other

00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:33,120
committees have in Fedora weave we

00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:37,910
focused on being pragmatic over being

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:40,140
perfect we have focused on process I

00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:44,400
will I'm getting I'm getting there

00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:47,880
Matthew we've focused on process rather

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,890
than programs we've tried to get things

00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,260
done you know we've tried to focus on

00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,640
using lazy consensus when we can rather

00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,100
than having to have every committee

00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,720
member vote on every single ticket we've

00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,930
really really focused on what we call

00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,280
low friction things which will explain

00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:05,430
the slide why would you want a banana

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,920
peel on ice so for it just just as as

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,540
one example we'd like to have release

00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:24,870
parties and I'll give you a copy of the

00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:25,380
slides later okay I will go back you're

00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,930
welcome

00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:30,150
so for example one of one of the things

00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,530
we focused on is is we want to increase

00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,240
the number of release parties that

00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:35,370
happen when we release a new version of

00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,720
fedora well how can we do that so we

00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,240
come up with what we call our low

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,310
friction release party process it used

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,100
to be that getting a release party

00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,780
approved was

00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,640
a little bit of a headache you'd go file

00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,590
a ticket you'd wait a few weeks you'd

00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,910
hope they voted on it maybe they did

00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,560
maybe they didn't maybe you hadn't

00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,760
provided all the information upfront

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,290
that they needed and there was often

00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,730
several weeks of back and forth and back

00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,590
and forth that can I get this money and

00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:58,180
okay we had a release party now what do

00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,860
I have to do to get reimbursed and oh

00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,420
can I get some swag shipped to that

00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,070
release party oh that's another process

00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,330
I have to go follow and it's it's a big

00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:06,670
pain anybody been there I've been there

00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:09,310
it's it's not fun um so what we tried to

00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:11,800
do is make that as low low friction as

00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:14,050
possible so what we said is if you want

00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,060
to have a release party shell out a

00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:18,760
ticket it's going to be approved within

00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:21,340
days not weeks or months but days I

00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:24,010
think that the if I remember correctly

00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,390
it has to have either to a to positive

00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,190
votes for members on the committee and

00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:30,700
no negative votes within three days and

00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:33,340
and then it's approved that gets you up

00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:37,000
to $100 one hundred US dollars in

00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:38,950
reimbursement for the for the party it

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,480
will get you stickers and maybe a little

00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,560
bit of swag shipped directly from Red

00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,090
Hat that you don't have to worry about

00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,150
opening another ticket to get that on

00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,980
its way and that sort of thing so that

00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,240
was just one of the early wins as being

00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,510
able to focus on how can we make this

00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:55,240
process simple and easy for people to

00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:57,190
release parties and then we've done some

00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,140
work around trying to make it easier for

00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,670
maybe larger events maybe a small event

00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,590
that's a few hundred dollars or maybe a

00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,390
medium-size event that's you know maybe

00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:06,760
a thousand dollars or so to throw or

00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:09,580
other things to get that approval

00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,840
process shortened down into for those

00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,550
larger events weeks instead of months

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,420
and for the small events you know days

00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:18,220
instead of instead of weeks so that's

00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,950
that's one major accomplishment another

00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:22,120
major accomplishment we've we'd like to

00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:24,760
take credit for really this is all

00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,490
red-hats fault is that

00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:30,520
shipping swag used to be one of the

00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:33,219
biggest pains we had in the ambassadors

00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,780
program certainly especially you know in

00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:36,280
countries where it's hard to get things

00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,400
shipped from one country to another I

00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,590
see several people nodding their heads I

00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,789
can't tell you how much of my my loss of

00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,680
hair while I was the Fedora project

00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,090
leader was attributed just to trying to

00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,460
get stuff shipped from one country to

00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:49,690
another or get somebody to take an extra

00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,490
suitcase when they're flying from

00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,500
country a to country be full of stickers

00:08:51,490 --> 00:09:03,990
or USB keys and hope they don't get

00:08:53,500 --> 00:09:03,990
I'm stuck in customs somewhere so yes

00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:12,460
yes it's nice nice to have an F cake

00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:14,680
except now you need a new F cake so so

00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,080
so not having to worry about that so so

00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,000
Bex has gone above and beyond the call

00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:22,360
of duty in this case to get Red Hat to

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,510
just store that swag centrally and then

00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:30,700
we say hey will you ship XYZ to country

00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:33,760
Z and they and all that shipping does

00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,680
not go on our budget so so yeah a big

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,970
and a round of applause to red hat for

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,190
stepping up there and being willing to

00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:43,690
make that easier for us that saves us a

00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:46,270
lot and if I never have to drag a

00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:49,330
suitcase of stickers you know again I'll

00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:51,340
be a happy man um another thing that we

00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:53,410
focused on is improving the budget

00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,610
process both in terms of better process

00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:57,550
for getting things approved and

00:09:54,610 --> 00:10:00,850
reimbursed more quickly as well as

00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:02,200
better transparency I don't know how

00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,580
many of you know this but we have a

00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,500
budget website where you can go see

00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,150
what's been spent what's been allocated

00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,710
to different groups and and what's still

00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,870
out there remaining that we could spend

00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:13,960
on an event if it was you know we deemed

00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:15,310
it or they to be used there is we just

00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,690
put out to put this out there there is

00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,890
money out there that we can use for

00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,600
events if they're the right kind of

00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:21,190
events and it's the right kind of thing

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,190
I'm not saying that hey we've got money

00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:25,570
let's go spend it willy-nilly but if you

00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,310
if you're thinking about holding an

00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,870
event come talk to us well we'll

00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,060
evaluate that and we may be able to help

00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:35,410
you fund fund an event if that's if

00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:36,640
that's necessary so I think that's an

00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,980
improvement one of the things that's

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,280
still a work in progress is this right

00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:46,090
here anybody know what car that is what

00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:47,350
is it it's an ambassador right anybody

00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:50,680
who's been to India knows the the

00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:52,420
Hindustan and you know motors ambassador

00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,880
it's a classic it's an absolute classic

00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,680
car if you're in India and so we've

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,490
we've in the mine chair committee we've

00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:02,620
been working on the ambassador's program

00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:04,089
trying to figure out well how does that

00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,280
work now we've we've made some changes

00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:06,590
to it for example ambassadors used to be

00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,000
on a

00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,740
regional basis so there was a North

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
America group and there was an European

00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,560
group and there was a Latin American

00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,770
group and there was an Asian group right

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,720
and a lot of the budget decisions a lot

00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:20,480
of the approval decisions a lot of the

00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,610
hey what swag are we gonna develop and

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,670
ship and that sort of thing was done on

00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:29,740
a regional basis and to be honest that

00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:33,500
led to a lot of flame wars yeah a lot

00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:35,390
led to a lot of angry conversations and

00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,410
we found that was easier for us to say

00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,640
okay we're gonna get it rid of the

00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,650
region's we're gonna keep the Ambassador

00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,390
program as it is for now basically the

00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:43,400
same but I'm gonna get rid of the

00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:45,140
region's will centralize that those that

00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,670
decision-making process try to improve

00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,200
the process try to speed it up because

00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,880
there was nothing more frustrating than

00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,500
having a region where they couldn't get

00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,420
enough people in the room at the same

00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,950
time to have a meeting to have the

00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,920
didn't you know at the debate to have

00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:59,510
the decision and approved things and I

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,550
think that's gone fairly well I think

00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,320
some of the some of the ambassadors are

00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,490
like well that's what I did was I was in

00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,230
that regional meeting and now the

00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,240
regional meetings gone away what do I do

00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:10,070
and so we're trying to figure out does

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,650
it make sense to keep the Ambassador

00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:14,960
Program as it is we change it do we get

00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:16,490
rid of it in the meantime what we've

00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,200
come up with is what we call our

00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:22,480
advocates program which you can think of

00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:24,800
is a very again low friction light-touch

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,850
program it doesn't have all the formal

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,470
mentoring and everything like The

00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,480
Ambassadors program did but it's a it's

00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,190
an easy way for somebody who's either

00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,950
already in fedora and wants to start

00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:35,360
doing outreach or is new to fedora wants

00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,580
to do outreach as they learn the ropes

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,630
to come in and join them and do that

00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,690
kind of you know person-to-person

00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:43,250
outreach so more details on that on the

00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:44,660
docs site if you go to the mind chair

00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,910
committee there's some information on

00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,110
the program but we're still trying to

00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:50,030
figure out what to do with the

00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:51,350
ambassador's program I know there's been

00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,550
some discussions with the council

00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,050
there's been a discussion on the

00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:57,050
ambassador's mailing list and we've got

00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:58,400
an outstanding ticket the mind share of

00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,810
you're a tracker if you want to if you

00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,560
want to add your comments we'd loved it

00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,120
we'd love to get your feedback

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,830
especially those of you who have been in

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,420
the ambassador's program for a long time

00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,830
kinda know the ins and outs and what's

00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,630
what works and what doesn't we would

00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:11,960
love your feedback as we try to evaluate

00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:16,060
that over the next several months so

00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:18,980
that's that's my chair in in a nutshell

00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:21,370
questions comments complaints rotten

00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,370
tomatos

00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:43,959
month and a half ago maybe

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,930
right

00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,820
right and Annette

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,779
right well

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,910
yep so so just for that for the record

00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:43,110
and the camera here Nick was that asking

00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,120
about you know when we were having this

00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,680
discussion you know in the in the mind

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,690
chair committee one of the questions

00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,660
that come up is what what what do the

00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:53,250
ambassadors do that that they couldn't

00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,440
already do without that title of

00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:58,290
ambassador and so I have I have some

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,060
opinions on that I'll try not to taint

00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,620
your opinion with my opinion on that I

00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,150
know several of you have come to me with

00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,980
your opinions and well we'll have a

00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:08,100
healthy debate about that

00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,780
but but that's really again if if if

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,040
there's a friction point there of the

00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,690
only reason I'm becoming an ambassador

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,400
going through those hoops is so that I

00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:17,130
can help plan an event if we could make

00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,510
it easier with less friction then that's

00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:21,180
something we want to focus on but still

00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:23,340
we there's absolute value in having

00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:26,040
people who are out there and feel like

00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,930
they're empowered to hold events to to

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,690
do outreach to talk to other people to

00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:31,680
help bring other people into into fedora

00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,750
we don't want to get rid of the work

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,490
that the ambassador program is doing but

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,080
we may change the program such that it's

00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:42,960
that it's a little less owner us to get

00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:45,170
involved in that three parts okay let me

00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,170
take notes

00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,270
Thanks hello so I'm just going to say

00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,710
made for people who haven't been looking

00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:01,240
at the mind your ticket tracker been

00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,280
following at all or looking they're

00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,820
closely could you just briefly summarize

00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:10,300
that that ambassador proposal and then

00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:12,820
maybe direct where to bring any feedback

00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:17,050
if someone has any and when to do that

00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:19,600
by sure okay three things what how and

00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:23,110
when okay I can I can do that okay so

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:26,770
the the basic proposal as it is now is

00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:29,770
to dissolve the ambassador's program as

00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:31,330
it is today but instead use this at this

00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:35,860
this advocates program that we had

00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:37,540
started up as well as the join sig to

00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,550
keep to take on those those same roles

00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,470
of getting people involved in fedora

00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:44,920
helping them know where to get started

00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:49,270
as well as planning events and doing

00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:51,220
doing sorts of things I go back and

00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:53,050
forth on whether like yeah we can do

00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,640
that or I'm not sure that's gonna work I

00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:57,790
I personally think there's still some

00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,500
value in having people in your region

00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,030
that speak your same native language and

00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,870
not just one sig they handle all that

00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:06,040
all but you know I'm open to ideas

00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,900
anyway that's that's the basic proposal

00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,700
as I understand is that pretty pretty

00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:12,930
accurate Justin I think you were more

00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,930
involved in the proposals that I was

00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,189
raining like we're summarizing where we

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,439
want to go with this program and what

00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:25,449
makes the most sense for fedora and 2019

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,890
so yeah yep you got it okay this the

00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:30,940
second part of the three-part question

00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:32,830
was where should you give feedback no

00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,320
that's that's part three is when part

00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:37,299
part two is where the best place to give

00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,809
that feedback would be in in the

00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:43,000
mindshare Committee Aguiar ticket if you

00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:44,890
need that link hit me up you know after

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,059
the talk or any time during flock here

00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,950
and I'll send you the link or find me on

00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:50,140
IRC I'm Jay Smith I'm really hard to

00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:51,370
track down I'll send you the link

00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,280
straight to that ticket that's the

00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,870
preferred place to have that discussion

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,280
there we were also hoping for some

00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:00,250
discussion on the ambassador's mailing

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,200
list I haven't seen a lot there yet but

00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,700
we've preferred in the ticket so it's

00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,130
easier for us on the committee to go

00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,179
through that and address those concerns

00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,440
so the third part of the three part

00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:10,929
question is when should you give that

00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,000
feedback since since you know I would

00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:15,010
like to say yesterday we were hoping to

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,750
have this this finalized before flock

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,730
we're not there yet we would love more

00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,950
feedback part of the reason we haven't

00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,240
made the decision yet is we don't feel

00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,710
like we've had enough feedback so please

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,510
make your feedback in the next week

00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:28,150
maybe the next week and a half at the

00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:29,919
outset because you know we need we need

00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:36,370
your feedback so we can go ahead and

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:38,679
make that decision our Council hackfest

00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:42,520
one of the things we sort of said was

00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:44,169
this $150 at the mindshare hackfest

00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,059
you know every year and a half ago we

00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:47,890
came up with this $150 low-friction

00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:49,600
thing which can be used for more than

00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,950
just release parties basically or

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,380
anything that seems like a good idea

00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,460
just go do it so at the hackfest we kind

00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,260
of set a metric

00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,960
we'd like to have two of those a week

00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:02,350
this year and you know spend that comes

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,270
out to $15,000 on these over the course

00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:07,900
of the whole year how are we doing on

00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:09,940
that metric and if I think we're below

00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,049
it as I understand

00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,320
or I answer my own question a little bit

00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:15,640
as I understand it the committee has

00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,380
basically approved all the reasonable

00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,450
requests that come in so it doesn't seem

00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:21,520
like a committee level problem exactly

00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,679
but we're also not at the metric what

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,020
can we do to make more of those things

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,340
happen so my first opinion is I don't

00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,840
think there's enough people in the

00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,730
Fedora community who know

00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,760
what that one that know that that's

00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:35,440
available and to that know that we've

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,179
made the process that much easier to do

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,289
I think it's a I think it's a

00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:39,880
communications problem more than

00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:42,100
anything at least in my mind I don't

00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,480
think we've you know and that's part of

00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,159
the reason why I wanted to do this talk

00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,900
here is to help people understand hey

00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:49,570
what does this we've done and why is it

00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:52,240
easier and then how can we I have in my

00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:55,059
mind idea of a per week graph that shows

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,190
this that we could publish I don't like

00:19:55,059 --> 00:20:00,250
your graphs on I do like graphs here

00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:02,320
Justin and maybe this is more

00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,730
appropriate for the the hackfest but

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,039
maybe just kind of food for thought of

00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:07,570
this is in the greater context of the

00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:09,309
marketing team right now which is I

00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,169
think trying to figure out it's larger

00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:13,440
purpose there's been some really great

00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:16,450
discussion in their own ticket tracker

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,330
about where they're best use of their

00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:21,520
time energy and focus is so I think like

00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:23,260
coming up with these bite-sized tasks

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,580
that are very small and like using

00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:27,220
social media as a way to do

00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,990
communication and engagement could be a

00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,350
really effective way of trying to get

00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:34,299
people who are outside of our usual

00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:36,159
circles of communication like at some

00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:38,620
point I think we can only reach so far

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,899
within like mailing lists and IRC and

00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,669
these other established places that the

00:20:40,899 --> 00:20:43,870
Fedora project operates but I think

00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:46,029
maybe we could work with the marketing

00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:47,890
team to get creative on some of these

00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:50,260
other things that we were already doing

00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:52,000
to some extent you know and we could

00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,039
maybe engage a little bit more but I

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,149
think we have to think a little to kind

00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:58,929
of wrap this up I guess that we have to

00:20:55,149 --> 00:21:00,309
think about how we engage with the

00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:02,919
marketing teams I think they've struggle

00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:05,380
with these really big broad things that

00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:06,909
are very hard to approach but I think we

00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:09,010
need to think really small I like what's

00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:12,190
one thing we could do in the next two

00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:14,679
weeks like the talking points or maybe a

00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:16,299
social media like strategy for release

00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:18,700
parties you know two weeks before a

00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:19,750
release party so well I mean let me ask

00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,570
this question how many people have

00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:26,679
attended a fedora release party

00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:28,990
show of hands how many people have

00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:33,970
actually done a release party themselves

00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:35,919
they've led1 us how many people would be

00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,360
willing to and just didn't know that the

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,260
funds were available to do that and

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,200
that's something that we would help

00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:43,820
sponsor a few great so

00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,289
I guess I guess we get we all need to

00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:49,190
pitch in and help Mathieu make his

00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:50,749
numbers so it's just one idea it could

00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:52,909
be it could be other events whether it's

00:21:50,749 --> 00:21:53,899
a local meetup whether it's a hey

00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:56,119
working that we're gonna get together

00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:57,980
and we're gonna focus on you know it's a

00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:59,960
it's a hack fest for fedora IOT here

00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:02,139
it's a container hack fest or something

00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,139
like that

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,200
yeah because it's it's yeah

00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:25,860
appreciate Justin's implication that the

00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:28,630
marketing team exists in as functional

00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,760
because that leads into my question is

00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:33,130
you know the marketing team has largely

00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,169
relied on the volunteer effort of a

00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:38,770
single person with a couple of us

00:22:35,169 --> 00:22:41,799
pitching in very sporadically but what

00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:43,870
is mindshare doing or considering to

00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:45,880
help beef up these volunteer efforts

00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:47,940
where we can't really get sustained

00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,700
momentum because we're relying on people

00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:54,039
donating their precious spare time you

00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:55,840
know that's a really good question I

00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,700
wish I had a perfect answer for it I

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,309
think one just increasing communication

00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,929
and getting getting the word out that

00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:04,960
these things are happening is part of

00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:08,350
that I think too it may be that that

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,659
having a separate you know marketing

00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:12,280
team and a design team and you know a

00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:14,350
bunch of little teeny tiny teams that

00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,330
are maybe one or two people in the long

00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,710
run may not be as efficient of having

00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,809
some some you know maybe some

00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,460
consolidation there and maybe design and

00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:23,590
websites and marketing work together as

00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,090
I you know don't know what that team

00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:27,220
would be called but it doesn't

00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:28,690
necessarily have to be individual teams

00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:32,020
they can they can share work in a

00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:34,659
slightly larger team there is no team of

00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:36,220
one you know every team should be big

00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:37,960
enough to you know big enough to feed

00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,640
with two piece pizzas but small enough

00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:44,080
that you don't need more than two pizzas

00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:46,030
to feed right all right any other

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:50,860
questions comments complaints rotten

00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:52,929
tomatoes funny jokes all right well

00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,280
don't let me keep you from I think is it

00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:55,840
lunch an hour's at 12:30 a.m. right

00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,250
let's lunch now I don't even get to let
