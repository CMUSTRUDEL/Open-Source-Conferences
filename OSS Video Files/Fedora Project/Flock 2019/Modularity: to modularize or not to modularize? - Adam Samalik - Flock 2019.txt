Title: Modularity: to modularize or not to modularize? - Adam Samalik - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-08-28
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	The goal of this talk is to provide a higher-level guidance about more complex module packaging, and to set a common ground before discussing this and other topics at the Modularity & packager experience BoF.

I'll have a multiple packaging problems prepared, and demonstrating how Modularity can help with some of them, but also which ones Modularity can't help with. I'll offer existing non-modular solutions to some of the problems as well.

This is a higher-level talk than tooling and making modules, but more detailed and guiding than my previous introductory talks.

	00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:11,940
so my name is Adam and this would be

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:14,610
mostly discussion about mutuality and

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,369
then we can discuss various problems

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,520
mostly like what should be mutual eyes

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:42,539
what should my eyes what is it useful

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:50,030
for etc so right and this is the basics

00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:53,219
but when they start a question and

00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:55,829
that's where we have some confusion

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,859
because the answers definitely no not

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,510
really

00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:06,390
there are things that you could do

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:08,370
before it helps with some things that

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,400
you couldn't do before but also cases

00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:14,280
that you could do without modularity but

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,540
mortality doesn't really help to you and

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,670
we'll dig into those so let's have a

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,010
quick recap first before we start

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,360
discussing like about the modularity

00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:30,510
concepts what it is

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:32,670
so of course

00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:35,520
so just to recap is to push it super

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,430
simple like if I have Fedora releases

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,020
and there are some packages if I want to

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,480
modularize something if I want to

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,010
motorize the language what happens is

00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,460
that just like there's some this

00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,310
envelope around the factory

00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:51,820
language and that's it it's built a

00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:54,100
little bit differently it's consumed it

00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,570
can become some very similar way but

00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,880
that's basically all the difference but

00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,650
this isn't why we made it right we made

00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:04,090
it before because we want to have

00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:05,770
multiple versions so there are two

00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,270
versions of the language I still have

00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:10,000
the two versions of the language but I

00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:11,080
can build both those that are racist so

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,660
there's more flexible let's see what

00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,880
version you want to have and you don't

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:19,110
need to really care about like what to

00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,110
do or at least you have because it's

00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:27,280
because we have to like modules and you

00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:29,800
can think about it that's just one slot

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,690
on your system for every module so you

00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:35,739
can install books right you can only

00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:39,959
install one version at the same time so

00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:47,769
this is streams I don't think that's

00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:51,220
about stream expansion so stream

00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:56,890
expansion is something how do we deal

00:02:51,220 --> 00:03:00,100
with multiple versions so imagine I have

00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:04,049
two language streams the same ones we

00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:08,799
had before and I have two applications

00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:12,280
with both languages I can say that I

00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:14,049
just want to build this and it somehow

00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,810
expands and that what happens with the

00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:19,900
binaries I end up with four binaries on

00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:22,269
the app and for each language I get two

00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:25,750
so I can basically deploy both

00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:29,320
combinations on my system and this is

00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:31,390
the way how I can deal with switching

00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,130
the languages but keeping the version of

00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:38,769
the application like that's how we can

00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:40,570
do stays the same um and I know this is

00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:42,430
a little bit confusing but you can also

00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,019
look at it from the other side so you

00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,940
can say that I have two versions of

00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:48,910
applications that are compatible

00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:53,500
both with two languages so that's

00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:55,780
basically stream expansion and then I've

00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,950
already mentioned this but no parallel

00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,319
installation so

00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:04,160
victory so I can only saw one stream of

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:07,250
language onto a given system um and that

00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:11,269
was basically the basics of like really

00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:13,819
high high level and now I have some

00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:17,389
examples I have three examples of

00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:19,269
packages that we can look at modularity

00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:22,880
can help unknown

00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:25,130
so because modularity is still in

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,080
progress like a lot of things have been

00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:31,040
already completed but not everything has

00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:33,979
been done so I'll be looking if it's if

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,510
it helps right now and if it helps by

00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:39,500
design which means like when all the

00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:42,560
features are completed um so the first

00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:47,090
one is DWM anyone knows DW and by the

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:50,180
way um it's just like it's a package

00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:52,910
that nothing depends on so it's just a

00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:54,740
no application and like we can see if it

00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,540
would Euler eyes is right um the answer

00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,000
is yes it does

00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,070
by the way that's right now because you

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,669
can just put it in the envelope build

00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:06,320
it's even in multiple versions I think

00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:11,090
we had like four streams for versions

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:13,490
available you can install it the same

00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:20,450
way you did before this is the most

00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:23,950
simple example um okay no js' it's a

00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,950
language it's an interpreted language

00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,850
there are also multiple versions but

00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:32,090
some applications my requires at both

00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:36,950
build timer runtime and I have the same

00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:39,380
question if it will work fine um okay

00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:44,270
the answer is current state almost and

00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:47,300
by design yes why I say almost so if

00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:50,750
something requires no js' at Build time

00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:54,430
which is not a module that's a problem

00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,430
right now but

00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,260
by then what about design if you have a

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,280
mini Jas and if you have a default

00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,200
string with no choice

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,980
I don't think I've mentioned default

00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,960
screams who knows about people's dreams

00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:11,060
cool so if you have a modulus thing as a

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,460
default scheme as a normal package so

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,350
you shouldn't see a difference and but

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,570
there's a difference now in the doll

00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:20,750
truth it's not visible so that's why I'm

00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:22,550
saying it's almost how we got around how

00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,160
we basically work around this that we've

00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:28,250
built also non GS and standalone

00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:31,670
packages I'm Steven did that so that

00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:34,070
works so there are still some things

00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:36,530
that need to be coming um and the last

00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:38,660
example I couldn't think about anything

00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:41,450
specific but it's a library it changes

00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:45,320
very rapidly and application need to

00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:49,160
adopt right at the same time so you will

00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:51,680
need multiple versions of the library on

00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:55,240
the system at the same time

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,240
so again

00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:14,910
two examples of this and the answer is

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:18,210
no and no modulation but existing

00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:27,300
mechanisms that we can still use compact

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:28,590
packages for example but yeah so this is

00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,330
something the majority doesn't address

00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:33,030
but it's been addressed before and we

00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:35,490
don't have to solve it again if that

00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:49,110
makes sense yeah

00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:49,890
I can so just a few people all right

00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,690
sorry about that

00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:53,690
so in fedora or in

00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,399
[Music]

00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:37,890
at the same time more importantly it

00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,510
doesn't it doesn't actually matter how

00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,700
the RPMs reserve it or anything

00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,770
yeah you can only have one copy of the

00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,500
same library that the rest of the system

00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:52,800
is aware of because it does dynamic

00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:58,860
libraries on the system yeah so yeah

00:08:52,800 --> 00:09:01,470
like the power right if it doesn't do

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,880
the version so but they have the

00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,440
libraries that needs to be there in

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,480
multiple regions so what happens so you

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,790
can rename the file so it's a different

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,830
final name so it exists the same time

00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,530
but you also need in the package so

00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:19,380
people do they would either version into

00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:20,520
the package name and there are ways how

00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,540
to deal with this but you need to

00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,610
basically change the name of the package

00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,560
and change them of the files so that's

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:29,940
how you can install multiple versions at

00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:31,770
the next to each other and this is

00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,630
something that motivated doesn't address

00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:39,300
because modularity deals with

00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:45,530
alternatives basically so if I show the

00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:48,090
slide that we have there ideally choose

00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:50,790
and I want them to behave the same I

00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,860
want to have the same executable for

00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,880
example on the system I just want to

00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,260
choose the version I don't want to

00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,540
change the packages in the way that they

00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,040
will install somewhere else like for

00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,140
example with software collections or

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:07,650
other mechanisms that can mangle that

00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:08,540
right so whenever I don't want to change

00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,190
the package and

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,709
want to have multiple alternatives

00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:17,240
modularity is the could be the good

00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:20,329
solution but when I need other hacks it

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:29,240
basically doesn't help if that makes

00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:31,480
sense introduce the concept of compact

00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,480
module

00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:55,670
and layering Ruby nesting model layer is

00:10:50,350 --> 00:11:01,100
but very luxuries which are tightly

00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:02,750
coupled to each other the box but I want

00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,019
to see who skis

00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:07,819
we stole commissions of this library on

00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:10,339
the system at the same time but these

00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:13,550
are each of us

00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:17,749
actually the but we teach and ever

00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:19,639
better it's a wake up one day group the

00:11:17,749 --> 00:11:23,209
group of beverages which work together

00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:26,059
and they want you to be installed in the

00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:28,200
same time Bennett who come to want the

00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:32,550
shirt but again nice I still think that

00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:38,760
I am side where monetary one will a

00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:43,860
merry dependency a market would be who

00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:46,590
carried about two so what I think is

00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,370
going on here is that um if I have when

00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:50,010
I have modules

00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:52,560
I have only one package language one but

00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:55,560
they can have multiple packages in there

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,510
and what modules can also represent is

00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:03,210
like an application language runtime and

00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:04,560
they can help you but from an

00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,690
application you can even have multiple

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,600
ways how to install the application like

00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:11,670
a motivation to additional features or a

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,650
database server client so you can music

00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:19,530
groups on packages in one module and use

00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:21,600
it as an envelope now do you want to

00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,340
have this two versions at the same time

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,770
right you want to have like the envelope

00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:31,140
feature but you want the final

00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:32,490
installation so for that we can do

00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,460
something like this and we're already

00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:40,290
doing it with Python for example which

00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:43,950
is a but we have Python modules that are

00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:46,380
called Python version like Python three

00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:48,420
six five three seven and because there

00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:51,120
are different module names that contain

00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,890
rpm with different rpm names the content

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,260
file with different file names they

00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:58,410
don't collide so you can basically do

00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,640
that so this is like a compact module I

00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:02,100
don't want to say that because that

00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:05,120
might stick but yeah you can you can

00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,120
visit the engineer

00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:19,550
yes yeah between exactly so it's a it's

00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,019
a similar concept to higher PM's like

00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,850
whatever is the name you can have it

00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:25,790
only once on your system so you can have

00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:29,209
one system one module name on the system

00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:32,980
but yeah if you make sure that like best

00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:32,980
on collisions you can definitely do that

00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:28,260
but it is it's kind of

00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:41,600
and then we use of an efficient

00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:43,140
effective benefits in defending

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,390
something our history

00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:48,140
and even the example I had like that we

00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:52,320
just wants to eat you can bet from that

00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:53,700
service like this that you can instead

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,829
of building all the packaged

00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,779
individually something individual built

00:14:55,829 --> 00:15:00,029
every single package for every single

00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:05,100
Ernie's again something emotional just

00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:10,140
once just the one who built those for

00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:11,970
you then begin to describe builders so

00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:14,130
like easier for you to describe the

00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:18,060
complications in this place than having

00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:23,720
it of mine I'm gonna give enough sub

00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:23,720
plate back

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,000
[Music]

00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:18,420
the stream expansion like this if it's a

00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:18,420
language you can let people

00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:41,690
I just wanted to basically walk through

00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:56,660
these examples and make sure that like

00:16:41,690 --> 00:17:09,829
everyone is maybe trying to memorize

00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:12,980
this example which maybe we'll discuss

00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:14,230
then we can all learn and maybe take

00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:17,669
notes

00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:20,230
vision is right for that do things

00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:24,939
everything is displayed that might be

00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:35,080
useful also to explain because this was

00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:37,809
not it just yeah that was this is yeah

00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:42,840
this is by design because we don't want

00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:42,840
to read about things if your goal is

00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:47,950
something we all want different things

00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:51,820
that were not possible easily before

00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:54,070
right but no installation them existing

00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,230
ways like the compact package use for

00:17:54,070 --> 00:18:01,600
containers or other ways how you can

00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:04,149
achieve that we don't we just will make

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,580
easy to big the alternatives which was

00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:08,740
which was the most design you schedule I

00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:12,360
can enter a squirrel's way one

00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,360
application money make money into space

00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:24,360
software collections but but

00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:32,390
hold the users over time and that's my

00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,010
review and they really liked the concept

00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:36,260
of being installed

00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:38,630
it's a having available a variety of

00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:42,590
different versions of things to install

00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:44,750
different type etc but they really

00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:46,760
didn't like the way a sales force them

00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,530
to figure to to install stuff in

00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,840
alternate locations that we run there to

00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:55,910
rewrite their software to find us the

00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:57,950
elevations so what it turns out is that

00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:00,320
they were almost never used in the

00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,610
higher-level install the new feature i

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,860
see on anyway they were generally

00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:08,440
created containers or civil war or the

00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,440
MMO stand pick one it just used it

00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:34,019
[Music]

00:19:39,810 --> 00:20:05,470
I despise even a decision it's like

00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:08,710
right after this one will be decision by

00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:19,720
Iranian Jews by their teach you come to

00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:22,270
the oceans and we'll have one more for

00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,700
the discussion that will be actually

00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:30,640
actively solving problems like this one

00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:32,380
is employed to figure out things but

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,110
later though much more focused group

00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,140
they were

00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,140
Oh

00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,559
[Music]

00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,350
[Music]

00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:54,350
we chose to salt just

00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,350
but

00:20:54,869 --> 00:21:01,899
the concept of India to adjust and

00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,590
modify attributes of module so I think

00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:04,590
this is

00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,690
what

00:21:48,859 --> 00:21:56,279
so yeah um if you with multiple packages

00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:58,619
and the module has a stream and I have

00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:01,200
for example the language one language

00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:03,090
too and if you use language one the new

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,639
updates you will give the latest version

00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:07,109
one but you will be switched to the

00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:09,929
version - this is for compatibility

00:22:07,109 --> 00:22:13,169
reasons and the compatibility is defined

00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:15,389
somehow and if for some reason there are

00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:18,210
multiple packages like language one and

00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:20,279
something that no one even uses we can

00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:23,190
express that the compatibility is only

00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:27,090
in the language one package so the other

00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:29,009
one can get changed maybe even randomly

00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:31,859
and you shouldn't expect it to let the

00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:33,330
change because we find a guarantee in

00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:35,479
the language package will bethe does the

00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,479
API

00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,079
[Music]

00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:50,139
the other the other aspect in the

00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:55,929
interview is expressly to describe to

00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:57,610
your community that we only we only all

00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:00,870
these other components that are part of

00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:04,539
it are supported insofar as they

00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:06,130
implement that is apart as far as they

00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:06,669
support this package if you have other

00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:10,990
problems

00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:12,730
I either I can't or won't maintain for

00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,049
that because I don't have that expertise

00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,549
a you know I pulled this into this a

00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:18,639
tendency I'm nobody else'll to maintain

00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:21,429
unity Dora so I'm gonna say I'm putting

00:23:18,639 --> 00:23:23,380
in this in this module stream it's just

00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:26,590
for my module if it needs to be used

00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:29,679
from other for important for one module

00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:31,029
that at that point those two the two

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,710
module others needs to describe it

00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:37,289
decide greater going to put it are they

00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:37,289
gonna maintain fully engage

00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:42,360
my little stream that they have up there

00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:46,110
- depend on so that extent they can

00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:47,430
remain limited in scope so there's a

00:23:46,110 --> 00:24:02,360
problem that needs to be sorted out

00:23:47,430 --> 00:24:02,360
between the money authors but difference

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,720
don't see in any way

00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,300
yeah

same space as any other produce I don't

00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:27,270
get eaten alert since I'm using an old

[Music]

00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:58,140
what you're describing is exactly the

00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:01,020
problem like Braille optional right is

00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,460
they you know we've had this we probably

00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,550
from a u.s. perspective you probably

00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:07,710
should more than somehow write that

00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:09,420
these things are you know less

00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:12,920
supportive whatever that means

00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:16,769
there's no playgrounds in this this is

00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,769
[Music]

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,260
100% why optional kept getting using

00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:24,180
everyone thought it was supported the

00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,950
other day this exact scenario but the

00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:28,200
same exact problem but if you've been on

00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:29,910
much of Miller's talk in the morning he

00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,299
was talking about people

00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:34,999
someone packaged in a publication

00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:36,950
like 300 packages dependencies that they

00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:39,320
built one of me I think of everyone and

00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:42,369
this is basically it like with a

00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:45,739
functionality that was a problem with

00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:48,499
it's a different uncle of meditation but

00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:52,509
it's so there's at least feel that you

00:26:48,499 --> 00:26:52,509
can define it like these packages and

00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,049
[Music]

00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:10,149

00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,539
[Music]

00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:28,229
so I mean we have the bids from the

00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:29,909
sighs mushrooms to break and the your

00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:31,259
sentence probably comics for example

00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:33,619
right it's now you know you're

00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:35,999
accidentally using some library cover

00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:38,519
that you know you thought it was all

00:27:35,999 --> 00:28:02,190
coming from me my door right so we've

00:27:38,519 --> 00:28:11,609
probably been across the board but you

00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:13,859
can also see light from which is the

00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:16,889
same or the same problem for software

00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:19,970
questions brace much do you need to hold

00:28:16,889 --> 00:28:19,970
another face you don't know

00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:35,790
everything from the shake-app yeah but

00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:39,070
there are us because we do have that

00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:42,450
concern for drivers we probably could

00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:44,740
have been a police say the bottom is

00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:46,180
actually yes

00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,540
following that he resigned the following

00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:56,940
packages which are attended which are

00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:56,940

corporate kitchen voters will choose for

00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:32,310
something it's communities so I should

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,960
take some votes on that during that

00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:35,960
exact concept are you

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:50,719
three a big bass essentially it's

00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:55,219
maintained well there is this

00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:56,840
consciousness also yeah exactly how to

00:30:55,219 --> 00:31:00,200
do it but I think we probably want to be

00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:02,659
seen absolute in the actual babies that

00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,039
these are not full events that we know

00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:07,879
that this is where but the person who is

00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:09,440
doing the mills is not the real 18 which

00:31:07,879 --> 00:31:11,059
is happening which might be happening

00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,259
that was packaged about like this would

00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:14,259
be much more transparent yeah

00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:22,329
[Music]

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,260
we're actually looking for a proper

00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,000
maintainer of the package and about mr.

00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:33,190
psychic we need to advertise this

00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,450
possibility to take his name to be

00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:36,450
proper to the repository

00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,789
[Music]

00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:52,960
so yeah

00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:19,349
[Music]

00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:28,509
[Music]

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,029
[Music]

00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:47,779
[Music]

00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:08,490
if you for example enable this module I

00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:12,659
want to install the languages of baggage

00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:14,580
to induce to say so like all of the

00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:17,220
packages let's say our in one people

00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:20,279
okay the package one language one

00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:22,200
language - so first step is that you and

00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:26,820
they believe the language stream super

00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:29,039
cheap so what happens your package is

00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:31,769
all the numbers were packages you start

00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:35,119
with those and then you take all the

00:33:31,769 --> 00:33:35,119
package from the enabled modules

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,359
[Music]

00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:24,139
[Music]

00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,499
[Music]

00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,270
[Music]

00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:27,400
so this and we should make sure this

00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,400
broken

00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,400
so

00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:04,210
[Music]

00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:22,000
[Music]

00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:37,310
that sounds really

00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:43,450
yeah and that's that's a that means

00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:47,550
something you smiled about a good

00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:47,550
package and I expect to be part

00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:01,320
[Music]

00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:09,140
[Music]

00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:24,159
[Music]

00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:48,460
let me just with the slide like

00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:04,670
it's kind of complex but the concept is

00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:07,039
very simple it just people maybe expect

00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:08,890
more with the activities is basically

00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:10,549
putting money into an envelope

00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:13,690
ultimately straights

00:38:10,549 --> 00:38:13,690
basically nothing else

00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:27,479
very romantic anticipation was over

00:38:22,749 --> 00:38:27,479
there means that's pretty much

00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,790
[Music]

00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:09,420
and also we have those dependencies like

00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:27,680
the stream expansion for example like if

00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:30,120
I want to have an application to this

00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:33,300
automatically and from the build site is

00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:36,090
mostly most of this image like it just

00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:37,620
explodes automatically but it knows if

00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:39,860
you define that for example this

00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,860
language

00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:52,660
so yeah it's basically just because with

00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:52,660
automation other things yeah

00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:34,590
you don't want to seem like a problem

00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:34,590
you slowly somewhere else by a double se

00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:41,309
[Music]

00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:21,810
[Music]

00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:21,810
you can

00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:46,010
we had a little bit clashing with ice

00:41:48,769 --> 00:41:51,769
so

00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,480
counter stage was a fight

00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:30,250
so what list would make the Clippers

00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,809
would have built-in released if I may

00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:34,589
prefer or release it must be supported

00:42:31,809 --> 00:42:34,589
antibodies

00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,480
it's not

00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,590
[Music]

00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:25,960
[Music]

00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,959
[Music]

00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:49,119
well at least I'm trying to do a

00:43:47,769 --> 00:44:02,199
distribution upgrade between them and

00:43:49,119 --> 00:44:04,900
stop you from 1331 during a breast of

00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:10,529
that revolution would say to say oh yes

00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:10,529
one accessory is no longer available

00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:19,130
we pacific either the same time to

00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:26,790
decide like the Dutchman looks like the

00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:29,130
upgrade you don't have to decide of the

00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:41,250
right the key when you go to trim this

00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:42,990
and now we start - yes that's yeah we're

00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:44,400
trying to basically with it's one of

00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:47,310
those things where you know he'll know

00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:50,370
so you know we have bad moments like

00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:52,740
there is docks there it's just we didn't

00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:58,800
know what things were missing until we

00:44:52,740 --> 00:45:00,810
ran into the problems but yet this is

00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:14,580
exactly what that was most people

00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:17,840
decision like to collect well write it

00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:20,959
again whether it's who remembers right

00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,959
[Music]

00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:31,599
pleasure of creating modules for quite

00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:38,979
efficient

00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:40,630
it depends on the package about the

00:45:38,979 --> 00:45:43,150
purpose of stream is to maintain it is

00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:45,579
to provide updates that remained in that

00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:48,009
everything path if you have a project

00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:52,690
that you know on each mine at least

00:45:48,009 --> 00:45:54,609
likes a v8 changes API then it's TFS

00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:59,430
upstream we have a project like no js'

00:45:54,609 --> 00:45:59,430
which was a major release the Nationals

00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:12,740
they stuff we had to talk about long

00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:15,410
while about the fact that this is the

00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:17,780
dark peg that's built on sometimes

00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:20,600
changes ABI you my reasons and sometimes

00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:23,870
doesn't so yeah redefined that it's you

00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:26,330
know 10.6 means 10.6 and forward until

00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:28,160
it's no longer until it's no longer so

00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:33,280
compatible and then you have so 10v

00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:35,770
might be in usually is 10 6 & 7 words

00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,550
that was company and that was mostly

00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:39,820
because they're terrible

00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:42,070
versioning give me sorry excuse me

00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:44,230
right like that but you can physically

00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:47,770
decide if you create the vitamin 3

00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:51,250
screen or three seven three seven what

00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:53,620
is like to help by how much do people

00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:55,990
care like the upstream basically how

00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:58,180
power they crave and as human cells like

00:46:55,990 --> 00:47:00,040
you can have three by three six three

00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:02,770
seven be the same we hope that the

00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:05,170
different so if you get to another

00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:07,330
stream and if they don't make sense

00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:11,250
yeah use the best judgment really

00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:11,250
shocked to think that your packaging

00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:21,290
I don't have any kind of consistency

00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:23,090
whatsoever just always really just

00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:25,970
acknowledge that it's not going to get

00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:28,460
that which is just telling your users we

00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:30,950
can't guarantee this listen this means

00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:32,930
I'll get those things don't need to

00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:34,550
represent versions we both entered into

00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:36,470
a purchase for this recent pickles a

00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:38,600
some kind of like speeds updates that

00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:40,820
makes sense and you can say these have

00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,650
vectors competitive over these make

00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:46,090
sense in this way so like a good define

00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:50,110
exchange doesn't mean I'm say isn't the

00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:52,940
DWS dead or whatever there's one version

00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:56,660
in the bananas yeah

00:47:52,940 --> 00:48:00,190
PWM have like four streams three

00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:00,190
operations and the one is ladies

00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:05,750
[Music]

00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:12,590
[Music]

00:48:39,769 --> 00:48:43,969
innovation sometimes something breaks on

00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:52,170
I would also like to point out yet again

00:48:48,769 --> 00:48:54,450
you know the guidelines and rules and

00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:57,029
all that stuff around rpm did not spring

00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:59,640
wholly from the mind of God at one point

00:48:57,029 --> 00:49:03,209
and then magically were correct around

00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:05,369
right it took many many years and many

00:49:03,209 --> 00:49:08,700
many revisions and many people ain't

00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:11,219
great efficacy to Putin to make what we

00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:13,259
have today module will suffer some of

00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:15,119
that same stuff you've learned some from

00:49:13,259 --> 00:49:17,190
from what we know on our camps and our

00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,349
games were the problem space is actually

00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:21,239
smaller so we think we can do a better

00:49:19,349 --> 00:49:23,699
job at the outset but we need feedback

00:49:21,239 --> 00:49:25,709
we need you know people to make comments

00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:42,809
and recognize it we didn't think of

00:49:25,709 --> 00:49:44,460
everything upfront and some things would

00:49:42,809 --> 00:49:48,839
you like to DES default

00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:51,020
a Sunday so it's in the schedule thanks
