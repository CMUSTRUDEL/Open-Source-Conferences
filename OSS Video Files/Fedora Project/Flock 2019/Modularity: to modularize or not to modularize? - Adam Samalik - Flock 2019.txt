Title: Modularity: to modularize or not to modularize? - Adam Samalik - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-08-28
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	The goal of this talk is to provide a higher-level guidance about more complex module packaging, and to set a common ground before discussing this and other topics at the Modularity & packager experience BoF.

I'll have a multiple packaging problems prepared, and demonstrating how Modularity can help with some of them, but also which ones Modularity can't help with. I'll offer existing non-modular solutions to some of the problems as well.

This is a higher-level talk than tooling and making modules, but more detailed and guiding than my previous introductory talks.
