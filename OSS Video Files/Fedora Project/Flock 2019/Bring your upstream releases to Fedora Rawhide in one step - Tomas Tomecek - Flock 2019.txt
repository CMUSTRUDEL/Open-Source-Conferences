Title: Bring your upstream releases to Fedora Rawhide in one step - Tomas Tomecek - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-09-02
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	Imagine a world where the only manual action you need to perform when putting a new upstream release into a Linux distro is to just approve it.

With packit service now live, this is the world we live in!

We will not stop there: as you develop your upstream project, packit service is giving you constant feedback on how your project is doing within Fedora OS: can it be built? Do the tests pass? Is my change breaking a compose?
