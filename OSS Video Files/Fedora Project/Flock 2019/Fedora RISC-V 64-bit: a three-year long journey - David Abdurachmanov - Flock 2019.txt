Title: Fedora RISC-V 64-bit: a three-year long journey - David Abdurachmanov - Flock 2019

Description: 
	Flock marks three years for Fedora RISC-V 64-bit (riscv64) efforts. August 10, 2016 was the day we could run rpmbuild on riscv64 [0]. We had multiple talks about Fedora and RISC-V in a number of RISC-V Workshops (Europe & Asia) and FOSDEM, but not directly with wider Fedora community. We would like to provide a quick introduction into RISC-V, Fedora RISC-V efforts (past, present and future). Furthermore we would like to gather some feedback on where we should focus the most.
