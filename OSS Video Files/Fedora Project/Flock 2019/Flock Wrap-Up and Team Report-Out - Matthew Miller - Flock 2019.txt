I welcome everybody to the final session

00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:11,299
of what I think is the seventh flock

00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,950
some sort of horrific lehigh number

00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:17,060
we're almost at double digits with this

00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:18,230
it might not know Mike okay there right

00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,330
yes

00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,880
sorry welcome everybody to the final

00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,980
session of like the seventh

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:31,100
I think flock here's Ben who has made it

00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:33,110
awake for the thank you all for being

00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,780
here and for all of your energy and hard

00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:38,359
work I really felt like this was a great

00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:41,120
conference and I felt a lot of positive

00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:43,370
energy and a lot of working together in

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,140
collaboration and talking and I feel you

00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,469
know energized for the next year until

00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:50,539
the next flock if you have any feedback

00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:51,920
on the conference anything that we could

00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:53,839
have done better there's always room to

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,059
improve it like next year's to be even

00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:58,129
better yet I wish we could announce

00:00:56,059 --> 00:00:59,629
where exactly it's going to be but we're

00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:01,219
still not we'd still don't quite have

00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:03,159
our stuff together on that but it's

00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:05,390
going to be somewhere in the middle

00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:08,450
portion of the United States we'll

00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,820
figure out exactly exactly where to come

00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,950
I said Midwest and somehow Denver got

00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,750
onto the list because people who are

00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:18,229
making the list don't don't know what

00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:20,509
the Midwest is but yep anyways here's

00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:22,880
our wrap-up session and we'll start with

00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:25,520
Adam with minimisation I guess is out

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,320
you're presenting on weight minimization

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,700
is that you're okay

00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:34,340
and I'm gonna get off the stage because

00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:36,590
I'm done know the minimization

00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:40,100
objectively and that was one of the

00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:42,350
reasons why I'm here about that so I

00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,929
gave a talk we had some discussions

00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:47,899
after that and I was very happy that

00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:49,899
people say that it makes sense and I got

00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:52,219
like 10 people from the community

00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:54,799
wanting to join the initiative and

00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:57,320
that's like I don't know 60% redhead and

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,999
it had so III think like this is not

00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,710
just a redhead objective it's just

00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:02,420
something that everyone cares about I

00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,820
feel so that's great and we'll be

00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:10,280
starting having first meeting next week

00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:12,860
on Wednesday and yeah it goes for other

00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,750
things like the federal ilt everyone

00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,420
wants things smaller and what I learn

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,940
about

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:21,890
for example what I didn't know is well

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:24,810
haven't realized is that it's not just a

00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:29,670
small system that needs to be immutable

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:33,060
and small and whatever but it's about

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:36,690
this it's outside its accessible there's

00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:41,060
no physical security and also some of

00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:43,440
the connections are super super slow so

00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,940
that's like one of the reasons why it

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,310
also needs to be minimal not just the

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,620
device is tiny um anyway so that's

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,560
minimization then we had modularity

00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:55,440
we had a fantastic burst of a feather

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,410
even discussion it was quite productive

00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,810
we discussed topic like modules in the

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:03,060
belt route that brought many people I

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:08,310
guess and we have steps how to how to

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:10,110
move forward there were some may be a

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,170
little bit cross this too but like third

00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,120
party things like how to enable people

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:17,100
to build modules without using our

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,320
infrastructure using their current ways

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:23,730
of things like in OBS or in copper even

00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:27,360
so yeah modularity things that was great

00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,440
I talked to Ben cotton and Paul about

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,739
for a magazine

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,739
we designed a new workflow for

00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,690
contributors to be much easier to make

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:39,570
the much more easier for people to

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:42,030
submit ideas and to pick something up

00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:45,420
and write it down so that might be

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:49,320
interesting there was something else um

00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:51,890
I forgot okay I'll just let other people

00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,890
speak Thanks

00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,290
[Applause]

00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:04,310
hello everyone so I ran the federal of

00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:08,510
Spion session so there's this fedora

00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:10,970
laughs Python slogan movement whatever

00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,650
nobody knows what it actually is and

00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:15,079
apparently we're not getting any more

00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:17,900
stickers printed unless we have some

00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:18,829
kind of marketing story so that's what

00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,019
that was about

00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:22,729
we have lots of notes that we need to

00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:25,370
clean up and post somewhere on the

00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:27,770
mailing list turns out the best thing

00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:30,800
about Python and fedora is that you can

00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:35,600
use all the multiple interpreters we can

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,789
support if you're building a Fedora

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,419
package there's one you have to use but

00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:43,669
otherwise if you're fine with upstreams

00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:45,320
upstream sources you can use any one you

00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:47,510
want and tested on all the different

00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:51,320
versions so people tend to like that a

00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:55,280
lot the other thing that we are missing

00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,810
in our sort of marketing for this is

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,840
that Fedora

00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,550
stays close to upstream which is quite

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,120
hard because we need to make the changes

00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:09,110
upstream and argue about them a lot but

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:12,020
it it pays off so we need to talk about

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:14,000
that somewhat more unfortunately there

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:20,120
were no marketing people in this session

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,889
so yeah we have stuff to talk about but

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:26,419
we don't know how to talk about them so

00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:29,690
we'll try to figure that out later the

00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:32,960
other session I I was part of was my

00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:36,169
project macros so that's an initiative

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,599
for not storing information in spec

00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,940
files but rather pull them from the

00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:41,710
upstream projects so you don't have to

00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,300
copy paste

00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,190
unfortunately this involves changing the

00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:50,090
upstream standards to actually have a

00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:53,180
place to have this information so we had

00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:56,150
a hackfest on the current iteration that

00:05:53,180 --> 00:06:00,620
will hopefully get it for there are 32

00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:06,540
or so and we got some useful feedback

00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:17,440
and and some PRS merged as well

00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:20,440
so that's me hello everyone I had two

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,450
sessions first of all I introduced our

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,000
community shift instance which is an

00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:28,330
open shift instance for people to

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,950
prototype applications run things that

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,600
are good for fedora run community

00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:34,210
applications that we don't have time to

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,040
run all that good stuff if you want

00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,350
access to that if you were not at the

00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,910
talk you can email me or file an

00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:43,810
infrastructure ticket either one and

00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:46,210
I'll be happy to add you so there was

00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:48,130
that and then we have the CPE hackfest

00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:51,310
this morning and we kind of broke up

00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:53,490
into groups there so I will just speak

00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:56,290
of the groups that I was involved in

00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:58,150
we've been kind of over our backlog of

00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:01,630
things that we want to do that are

00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:04,510
upcoming and we scoped out several of

00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:07,840
those to a pretty good extent we talked

00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:12,220
a lot about our monitoring story about

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,930
our logging and stuff make Matthews life

00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:18,430
better so he doesn't have to like look

00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:21,220
at aw stats ever again and we went over

00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:23,950
several other things that were upcoming

00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:26,590
and kind of how we could spec them out

00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:30,550
and get them prioritized for our for our

00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:32,380
team and just had a ton of hallway

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,300
discussions I do want to mention one

00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,479
other thing that I didn't do

00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:40,360
smooch could not be here this year but

00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:43,930
he has been working on epilate a lot

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,669
very hard and I think things are to the

00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,490
point where he has an announcement ready

00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:51,400
that will probably go out after flock

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:53,169
that epilate is is ready to go so that's

00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,200
that's awesome work from him and I just

00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:58,380
thought I'd mention it

00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,380
[Applause]

00:08:00,749 --> 00:08:06,059
so I was adding the the second group in

00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,889
the Indus EP act fest and we tried to

00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:09,749
bring some a little bit on now we want

00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:12,779
the package our workflow to look like in

00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:14,520
fira in in the long term in a long term

00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:16,740
because we currently have a lot of

00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,479
initiatives going on in fira about that

00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,729
touching the package of workflow the

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,490
package or user experience and we saw

00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:25,589
that if we don't come up with an unified

00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,569
vision on what the package our workflow

00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:30,860
should look like in you know a year or

00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:32,819
two or three from now we may have

00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,819
contradicting initiative contracting

00:08:32,819 --> 00:08:37,649
worked and if you know we want to we

00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:39,449
want to achieve that point but then this

00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:41,610
idea which may be a good idea by insole

00:08:39,449 --> 00:08:43,260
is actually contrapositive to the to the

00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,389
end goal so we tried to bring some a

00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,550
little bit on now that workflow should

00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:49,649
look like we'll need to spend some time

00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:52,610
on on this tool it's definitely it's

00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:55,410
still rough I'll try to recalculate

00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:57,240
recapitulate everything we said send an

00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,949
email to the to the devil list for for

00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,290
more feedback it's not going to be

00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:03,510
something that would be you know we all

00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,370
agree on from the start but it is a

00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,709
discussion that I think we should be

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,779
looking at so that we can actually align

00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:11,790
all of our work using a within one

00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:14,040
direction the second thing which are

00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,779
presenting was the right getting work so

00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,120
I'm very happy that's why I didn't get

00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:20,190
any rotten tomatoes with nobody's run

00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,519
over ran out of the room screaming and

00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,660
shouting and so I'm very glad for that

00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:26,310
there will be more changes coming into

00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,779
that there will be more unknowns if

00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,670
you're interesting give us your feedback

00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:32,040
if you're not interesting give us your

00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,959
feedback if we are blocking you give us

00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,790
your feedback and if we are enabling you

00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:38,329
please give us your feedback and with

00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,329
that thank you

00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:49,280
hello I have some notes hope you don't

00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:54,420
mind

00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:58,140
so this is the design team recap Renata

00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:00,360
gave a 101 session on UX UI and there

00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:03,270
were about a dozen attendees there we

00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,210
also had a fedora badges hackfest with

00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:08,460
some very lofty goals and a couple

00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,500
accomplishments we did a lot of

00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,950
brainstorming on different topics such

00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:16,500
as a pattern library how to incorporate

00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:19,700
badges into different processes and

00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:22,650
workflows in the Fedora project already

00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:27,120
and our biggest idea really there was

00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:30,600
visibility really ideas would be to

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,540
revive blog posts maybe create some

00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,930
infographics get more on social media

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,940
platforms just kind of blast it out

00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,680
there as much as we can and get it in

00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,840
everyone's minds that this is a tool

00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:46,200
that you can use to improve your

00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:48,560
individual projects and initiatives we

00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,930
also talked about badge criteria and

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:55,140
retiring some badges may be that they

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:57,450
don't work anymore style guide updates

00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:00,330
and we discussed a lot about the look

00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:04,800
and feel of the badges and how we might

00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:07,380
want to see that evolve Renata and Tanvi

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,840
ransom usability tests to get

00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,550
information that will inform a redesign

00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:15,210
that hopefully we can see in the next

00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:18,720
year or to happen and Renata is going to

00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:21,570
provide a report for us some ticket riaj

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,000
we kind of ran out of time on that in

00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:27,810
the afternoon we had members of the

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,390
infor team attend and we discussed pain

00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:32,550
points of the badges project things that

00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,670
need to be done things that would be

00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:37,470
nice to be done things that would be

00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:40,170
nice to have in the future such as

00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:43,710
improving the website speed moving to

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:46,910
Python 3 a website facelift further

00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:49,140
social media integration on the website

00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:52,499
potentially integration with the Fedora

00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:54,869
OS interface for their websites of

00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:59,609
categorization organization filters

00:11:54,869 --> 00:12:02,579
basically a better a better experience

00:11:59,609 --> 00:12:05,099
for people using the website the biggest

00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:08,309
issue we found on the development side

00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:10,889
is automation of badges so if people

00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:12,899
want to work on that that would be great

00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:15,659
the biggest success we have on the

00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,939
development side is that we started a

00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:20,239
discussion and planning for an outreach

00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:25,199
intern so hopefully we can get that

00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:27,509
moving for the next session and there is

00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:31,559
some mentor commitment behind that so

00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:33,029
overall it was a success the main thing

00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:37,799
we got out of the session this session

00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:42,719
was surprised a lot more work to do

00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:47,939
and hope that the project is not going

00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:49,709
to die overall for the design team you

00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:52,379
know there was three of us here this

00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:56,489
year unless there's some people hiding

00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:58,529
in the Woodworks it's it's a little

00:12:56,489 --> 00:13:00,569
discouraging I think at my first flock

00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:03,569
like five years ago there was maybe a

00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:07,429
dozen or more so it kind of feels like

00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:10,049
the team might be dwindling a little bit

00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:12,479
so I had a lot of discussions with the

00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:15,209
people who were here about why and how

00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:19,649
and where we've gotten to the point that

00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:21,449
we are right so there are things that I

00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:23,669
feel can be changed from inside the

00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:26,789
design team like lowering the barrier

00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:29,639
entry the best that we can creating a

00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:31,769
more welcoming environment spending more

00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,989
time connecting with each other on IRC

00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:36,119
like I used to hear that the IRC was

00:13:33,989 --> 00:13:40,619
like hoppin cool place to be and now

00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:43,019
it's like crickets but there are also

00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:45,419
things that can be changed from the

00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:49,109
outside and the inside working together

00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:50,969
right so just like any relationship we

00:13:49,109 --> 00:13:55,739
need to identify and understand those

00:13:50,969 --> 00:13:58,319
issues communicate them and come up with

00:13:55,739 --> 00:14:01,229
solutions and then work from all sides

00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:04,229
to kind of come up and figure how we can

00:14:01,229 --> 00:14:05,939
make this a better thing so this topic

00:14:04,229 --> 00:14:10,159
brings me back to Kate Houston

00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:13,499
talk right clarity capacity and

00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:16,259
incentives and feedback right so I think

00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:18,089
the main incentive we can ask for from

00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:22,529
the community as a whole is recognition

00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:23,189
and feedback right for example sorry to

00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,289
call you out

00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:27,869
but when Matt was talking about new

00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:30,029
projects in the state of Fedora and he

00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:32,339
brought up why the logos were great

00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:36,659
there was absolutely no mention of

00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:38,939
design or the design team like we talked

00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:41,519
about the projects and we said the logos

00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:44,399
are cool but the design team was not

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,949
brought up so I think that's the kind of

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,959
place that we need to think like this

00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:52,849
work is being done by real people and

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:55,019
they deserve recognition for it right

00:14:52,849 --> 00:14:58,649
I've been trying to figure out the right

00:14:55,019 --> 00:15:01,379
places people teams to connect with to

00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:04,769
improve these issues and the reality is

00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:07,019
that we need help I need help right I'm

00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:10,559
gonna make a write-up on a lot of these

00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:13,049
thoughts and try to say it as best as I

00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:15,179
can in a blog post and I hope that

00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:17,369
people will read it and reflect on it on

00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:23,009
what they personally can do and what

00:15:17,369 --> 00:15:24,720
their team's can do to kind of make the

00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:26,639
design team feel a little more valued

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,519
and recognized for the work that we do

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:34,139
and also what can we do for you

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:37,769
we need work to do to have that feedback

00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:40,190
loop so that's my thoughts for Vlach

00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:45,859
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:45,859
[Applause]

00:15:50,649 --> 00:16:00,110
hi this is Amita we have done da heck

00:15:54,559 --> 00:16:02,839
test yesterday and we have done a lot of

00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:08,509
work which were pending since last six

00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:12,559
months being together in a room with all

00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:14,809
the team members so since last few years

00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:16,790
this team is relatively very new as

00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:20,329
compared to the other teams in Fedora

00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:23,929
and we have very less volunteer and the

00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:27,410
team members in the team but still we

00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:29,389
are thinking that how we can with this

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:33,350
limited volunteer time how we can make

00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:35,480
the bigger impact so the one thing which

00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:37,670
we brainstorm about is collecting

00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,240
feedback from the community people how

00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:43,490
they feel about for example Marie has

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:46,309
correctly pointed out that there is the

00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:49,009
less appreciation for this volunteer

00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:52,220
work so such kind of feedback we are

00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:54,799
looking for and for that we that coffee

00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,959
with friends session throughout the

00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,360
flock some of the sessions tactical has

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,459
taken and we would like to continue with

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,370
this kind of sessions will open a window

00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:06,620
in three months of time period and you

00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:09,649
can just fill a form or over etiquette

00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:11,720
in DI Peggy repo that you would like to

00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:14,329
talk and you would like to express that

00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:17,329
what is the pin point which we can help

00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:20,299
with so that is one thing which we added

00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:23,029
in our goal we would like to connect

00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:25,130
with internationalization and

00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:27,649
globalization teams to identify that

00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:31,309
what are these important content which

00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:33,470
are being published on fedora bag scene

00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:36,020
or the community blog post like the

00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:39,980
federal strategy or or the mission

00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:43,760
statements which probably the most of

00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:46,399
the hire people thority people are

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,559
writing and most of them are from us and

00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:52,039
their native native language is English

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:55,010
so not everybody understands that quite

00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:57,200
well so we would like to figure out what

00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,880
that content is which needs to be

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,430
translated

00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:06,640
in other languages so that people will

00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:08,860
feel more inclusive that I need that and

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,080
as you have seen that we are very

00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,030
successful with federal Wednesday event

00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,890
which we have done last year in 10

00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:18,850
different countries at the same time

00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:21,280
period or the same month so we would

00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:23,020
like to do more such events like LGBTQ

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,390
events since we have that format

00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,910
existing baseline that how to pull out

00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:31,840
such events throughout the world so we

00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:34,780
would like to do such events more since

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,270
we are the diversity and inclusion team

00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,940
and we have done a great job of being

00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:41,530
diverse I mean look around you how many

00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,510
different kinds of people are sitting in

00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:45,160
this room from different country from

00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:47,980
different culture from the of different

00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:50,500
languages but we need to folk you know

00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,810
extend our focus to the inclusion side

00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:57,640
as well are we including them well or

00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:59,080
not so for that we are working on taking

00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,210
some steps and working on the event

00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,510
guidelines as well so these guidelines

00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:06,640
be has done a great job in drafting that

00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:11,470
guidelines and she would like to share a

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:13,420
few points with you so we we have been

00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,940
working on a proposal for launching

00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:18,670
event guidelines for fedora like event

00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,470
organizers so people ambassadors who

00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:22,750
organize federal release parties or

00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:25,030
organizers for flock to help them make

00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,500
these events have like a more diverse

00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:29,680
audience and to make these more

00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,630
inclusive and till now like we worked

00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,150
started work on this two years ago and

00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:36,250
we had a lot of feedback from last flock

00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:38,620
which we incorporated in a recent

00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:41,050
proposal and this time we have a lot of

00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:43,030
actionable items and recommendations not

00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:45,760
just to the flock organizing committee

00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:49,360
but also for like other like smaller

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,130
local event organizers so during the

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,540
hackfest especially we got a lot of

00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,520
feedback from different organize

00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:56,980
ambassadors from different communities

00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,380
and we like compiled this recommendation

00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:01,600
and we will provide them to the relevant

00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,260
people but what we need from you right

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,880
now

00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,950
is to also go through this proposal

00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,290
because right now the only people who

00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:09,580
have reviewed this is like a few people

00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,500
but we need feedback from the whole

00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,020
community about this because this is

00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,720
for you and this will affect you so we

00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,820
will publish community blog post and I

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,590
really hope all of you look through it

00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,600
and give us our feedback if you don't

00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:25,300
like something if you feel it is not

00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:28,420
relevant or if it is hard for you to

00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:31,530
implement it please let us know and I

00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:34,450
would really like to hear back from you

00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:36,700
thanks thanks for that so other than

00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:39,100
that we also talked about some internal

00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,440
team processes we would like to improve

00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,540
them like decision-making process and di

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,880
advisor elections you will soon see that

00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:49,390
there will be DI elections in November

00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,910
timeframe other than that we would like

00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:54,760
to focus on the content creation and we

00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:57,850
did create a video which we would like

00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:01,900
to show you and before that I would just

00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:04,390
say that like Denise is here and she

00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:07,240
pointed out that how important this

00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:10,210
community is it's made by people right

00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,700
so these memories needs to be captured

00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:16,210
and these memories needs to be shared in

00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:18,550
the graphical data data way and also the

00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,440
people needs to be appreciated in the

00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:23,200
right way that is the least thing we can

00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,960
do about the community so for that the

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,780
happiness packet is one thing which the

00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:31,300
DI team would like to market enough and

00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:33,970
please use these happiness packets where

00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:36,340
you can send the appreciated words or

00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:38,170
this kind of certificate to the people

00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,600
in the community who are doing the

00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:43,000
awesome job and we have some more ideas

00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,430
like five years completion t-shirt and

00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,380
ten years completion t-shirt in

00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:49,450
community so these are little ways or

00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:53,410
ideas which we would like to implement

00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:55,390
in coming days so now and please send

00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:57,160
some fedora happiness packets to flock

00:21:55,390 --> 00:22:00,540
event organizers because I think they

00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,540
have done like a great job

00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,200

thank you everyone

00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:42,429
thanks a lot now I have to bore you with

00:24:40,269 --> 00:24:46,899
cgroups we - after such a cool video

00:24:42,429 --> 00:24:49,479
right haha so Laura is cheering that is

00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:52,659
cool so I promise it's the last time i

00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:55,289
impersonate Dan Walsh here but I'm

00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:58,509
pretty sure he would have wanted me to

00:24:55,289 --> 00:25:00,519
talk in front of everybody here that

00:24:58,509 --> 00:25:04,029
cgroups me - is happening and it's

00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:07,450
coming and Dan actually pulled the

00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:10,419
trigger on it already and with Fedora 31

00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:14,619
the default installation when you

00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:17,289
install it from scratch the the kernel

00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:20,529
will run with cgroups v2 enabled only so

00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:23,849
Neal you might want to check snap we

00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:31,419
check today lipfird is also not working

00:25:23,849 --> 00:25:34,359
yet you it's up to you to decide right

00:25:31,419 --> 00:25:37,149
if you like that or not but here just

00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:41,080
basically another heads up that cgroups

00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:43,840
v2 is happening we want it or basically

00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,749
Dan was pushing on DEFCON 4 earlier this

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,690
year for it

00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:52,450
somebody needs to start with it cgroups

00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:54,070
v2 is out for many years and if Leonard

00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:57,609
would be here I'm pretty sure he could

00:25:54,070 --> 00:26:00,309
talk hours about why we need it and why

00:25:57,609 --> 00:26:03,519
it's technically superior so from the

00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:06,940
containers ecosystem side somebody just

00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:09,789
needs to start and well at this time

00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:12,399
it's us so technically it means we

00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:14,889
cannot use run see because the OCI

00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:17,769
specification is not there yet so we

00:26:14,889 --> 00:26:21,159
have to use C run from Joseph Scriven Oh

00:26:17,769 --> 00:26:23,019
which is good because he's working at

00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:24,099
Red Hat so we can really make sure that

00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:26,739
everything is working fine

00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:28,629
I just enabled it on my Fedora 30

00:26:26,739 --> 00:26:32,529
machine today and it's it's working

00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:36,070
nicely so I want to encourage more to

00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:41,320
follow and make sure that everything is

00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:45,450
running any comments any any feedbacks

00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:45,450
screams is anybody scared of it

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:56,150
it's a very good question we will so dan

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,700
and I will sit down with Giuseppe next

00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:01,280
week and prepare a blog post so what we

00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:05,140
wanted to do is ideally publish it on

00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:07,340
Fedora magazine so that we get the most

00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:10,220
visibility as possible

00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:14,870
and also to give a heads up early to

00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:17,210
avoid other communities or to avoid them

00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:19,400
to misinterpret our intention so for

00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:21,320
instance there's mobi docker kubernetes

00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,360
yada-yada and there's a lot of

00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,040
competition going on but this is really

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,010
not about blocking others from

00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:31,310
continuing to work but somebody needs to

00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:33,950
pioneer there because if not we will we

00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:35,420
will stick with v1 forever and from a

00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:39,110
technical perspective it doesn't make a

00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:41,630
lot of sense so we will prepare a blog

00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:45,770
post and make sure to give all the

00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:47,660
instructions from the kernel basically

00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:49,760
it's just it's just changing the command

00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:52,670
line of the kernel so you update the

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,340
grub config you make you regenerate it

00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:57,460
and then it should work my famous last

00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,460
words

00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:08,240
for me can you repeat the question yes

00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:10,160
so if you upgrade at least that's the

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,990
plan nothing will change because we

00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,240
don't want to break exec existing

00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:17,480
deployments and workloads but if you

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,720
install a fresh Fedora 31 this should be

00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,720
enabled

00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:31,170
I have no idea

00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:56,660
in the end blame then that's right

00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:59,840
that's its hello engineer and I don't

00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:01,790
have any funny stuff in these crazy

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,450
stuff but the stuff that people hate me

00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:08,180
for yes I retired a few hundred packages

00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:14,980
few days back that booked rawhide and

00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:19,580
get texts is one of them anyway so I

00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:21,830
have given two talks this flock one is

00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:25,490
about mass branching and mass rebuilding

00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:27,920
modularity and one thing that I wanted

00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:30,050
to ask people who are here who maintain

00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:32,330
modules some modules that are tagged in

00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:33,920
to rawhide which are not supposed to be

00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:37,160
please let me know I sent an email to

00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,660
the devil list and please create a

00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,510
ticket in valence repose so that I can

00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:45,140
remove them from there and the other

00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:48,260
thing is a federal compost tracker which

00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:49,850
actually tracks the composer's and lets

00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:52,870
people know what has been failing gives

00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:56,810
some statistics and stuff like that

00:29:52,870 --> 00:30:00,260
I've I wish all the Sigma antennas

00:29:56,810 --> 00:30:01,820
especially the spins and laps

00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:06,170
maintenance will get a lot of advantage

00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:08,210
of out of it and then the other thing

00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:11,780
that I wanted to let you know is about a

00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:16,280
plate as Kevin mentioned smoochy worked

00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:21,920
on it or not and I enabled all the koji

00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:25,340
tags and body updates and nightly

00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:28,010
composes and stuff like that so I it

00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:30,580
will be coming pretty soon so look for

00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:30,580
it thank you

00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:34,130
[Applause]

00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:46,830
hi all myself Praveen my first language

00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:49,770
is Marathi and second language is

00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:51,810
English so in this audience how many

00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:55,710
people have first language other than

00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:59,880
English okay wow that's great very good

00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:02,490
so you know like in this flock we had

00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:05,370
six sessions on for non-english

00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:09,360
languages it included the technology

00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:14,220
plus language part 3 where the talks and

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:17,940
three where the workshop I was lead for

00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:19,730
CI and test cases workshop luckily I

00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,990
think many people turn out there and

00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:24,210
when you have many people in workshop I

00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:25,650
think best thing which you can do is

00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:27,840
like you know collaborate talk

00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:30,840
prioritize stuff so be able to

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:34,820
prioritize the stuff what we know now

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:38,670
what we have to do incoming one year

00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:41,040
that's what we did there was two

00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:43,920
sessions from the John Baptist the nice

00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:46,830
French guy who was in video so he left

00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,280
so I'm covering once one of his session

00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:52,590
as well

00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:55,710
where he he has excellent charts okay

00:31:52,590 --> 00:32:01,380
many float float or something for maybe

00:31:55,710 --> 00:32:03,300
last eight federal religious and so he

00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,920
basically demonstrated that the

00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,320
contribution at translation side the

00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:10,020
localization side is getting you know

00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:13,140
lower and lower and lower because of

00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:15,180
multiple issues so I will recommend

00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,280
people since there were so many

00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,900
parallels talks so people who are

00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:22,650
interested to please go through his

00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:24,240
video I think it's recorded that's what

00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:27,230
I will cover I think remaining part

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,230
gents will cover thanks

00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:37,279

00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:39,620
day Thursday we had a session on lang

00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:43,039
tax I will be covered to connect

00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:44,929
evolution of lamp action fedora and we

00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:50,360
demoed some of the changes coming into

00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:52,340
Fedora 31 like line pack score and blank

00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:54,139
packs auto installation supporting drum

00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:58,009
software and we thought a bit about

00:32:54,139 --> 00:33:00,230
future developments and the other thing

00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:02,779
well which is kind of interface of I

00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:04,759

and we had a great

00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:16,790
we had a great hackathon on Friday

00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:19,970
Saturday morning and people showed up

00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:22,100
contributed tools got some new finite

00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:25,280
element tools in that were very excited

00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:27,909
about and we presented a poster this

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,929
year at computational neuroscience and

00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:32,360
hopefully next year at human brain

00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:35,960
mapping for the Vener imaging pipelines

00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:38,270
so I hope everybody can have a look at

00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:41,929
