Title: Fedora kernel tree... OF THE FUTURE - Laura Abbott, Jeremy Cline, Justin Forbes - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-09-02
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	The primary way Fedora kernel developers work on the Fedora kernel is via the kernel dist-git repo. This has served us well for years. The preferred way for most developers to interact with a kernel tree is via a src-git tree. The focus of this talk is about ongoing work to produce a src-git tree suitable for use in Fedora and the unique pain points for a kernel. Part of this talk is also a follow up to last years talk about aligning Fedora + RHEL and how this work fits into that.
