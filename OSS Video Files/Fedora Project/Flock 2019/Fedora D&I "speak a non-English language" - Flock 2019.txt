Title: Fedora D&I "speak a non-English language" - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-10-15
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	Maria Leandro, Bhagyashree Padalka, Jona Azizaj, Luis Enrique Bazán De León

This is a two-part evening activity proposal. One evening of Flock, we will gather together and plan a conversation. Each part of the conversation will be spoken in a different language. The languages we choose will be from what languages are spoken by whoever participates. On the last day of Flock during the wrap-up session, we would present the multi-lingual conversation to the rest of Flock.

--
Recordings of talks at Flock are a community effort. Unfortunately not everything works perfectly every time. If you're interested in helping us improve, let us know.

thanks for coming for the DI heck fest

00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:10,059
I'll just go through the agenda

00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:30,790
so if you see we these are the beggar

00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:32,739
tickets which we want to complete few

00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,989
months back but they are still pending

00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:36,809
so we would like to complete them during

00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:40,449
the heck fest

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:42,580
and we'll go through these tickets one

00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:45,190
by one who will discuss them where we

00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:47,230
are what these tickets are all about

00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,180
we'll give you the summary and then

00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,100
we'll discuss the open-ended things and

00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,590
if you think that there are few things

00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,239
which you can also contribute to towards

00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:59,320
with these tickets to be accomplished

00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:02,380
please feel free and that is the way you

00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,809
will be get involved so the first thing

00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:08,890
we would like to discuss about our is

00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:11,560
our team goal and we have some existing

00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:15,039
goal for our team and we also had this

00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:18,610
great idea from tactical that we should

00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:23,050
be doing a coffee session among friends

00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:24,670
so we did few coffee sessions tactic I

00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,920
did it with some of the contributors

00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,289
during the flock and we wanted to know

00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,959
some pain points if there are any and we

00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:36,869
wanted to involve them as the work we

00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:39,580
want to do within the DI team - you know

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,209
suggest some solutions towards these

00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:45,009
issues or the pain points so we would

00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:46,750
brainstorm these ideas and we will

00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:49,599
figure out that if there are any more

00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,700
goals which we would like to involve any

00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:54,039
short term long term or any future goals

00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:58,509
and then we have this fedora even

00:01:54,039 --> 00:02:01,479
guidelines which we started I guess here

00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:03,280
earlier so if you have seen the

00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:07,050
gender-neutral bathrooms and the quiet

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:10,149
room or during flock so these all are

00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:12,910
coming from the ideas we are designing

00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:15,430
under the fedora event guidelines the

00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:18,010
majority of the work is done by be here

00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:20,650
so we will take over these slides and

00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,720
she will share what work we have done so

00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,720
far what is covered and what is the

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,349
future goals under this particular topic

00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:32,079
then fedora Women's Day I think this is

00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:34,110
the third year of federal men's Day we

00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:36,810
are running we

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:40,050
started it three years back and with

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:42,000
with I guess few three three fedorovna

00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,670
three or four food or many events across

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,410
the globe but but last year we have done

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,500
a great job and we have done 10 federal

00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:52,830
mainstays across the globe and this year

00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,930
we are targeting even more so if you if

00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:58,350
you also want to do federal women stay

00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,420
at your place this is the right time to

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:04,410
submit your proposals and we will talk

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:08,220
about it more under this topic then

00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:10,590
these are the few team related things we

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,989
would like to refine the team processes

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,000
a little bit more or by defining the

00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:18,989
federal council diversity advisor Tom

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,840
and diversity inclusion teams lead rules

00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:29,520
so that will be more of the team

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:32,850
specific things so I just give you a

00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:37,920
brief about what we have done in the

00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:40,049
past year in DI team we are

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,950
let me tell users that we are very a

00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:49,320
small team of few people and last year

00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:52,980
it was like very less of you know active

00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:55,590
volunteers we had in this team still we

00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:59,220
did a great job and accomplished many of

00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:02,340
things which are listed over here di

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,320
team always sponsored outreach program

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,390
and that we have done last year as well

00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,120
we have organized Fedora Women's Day

00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:12,420
which I told you that ten of these

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,730
events we have done across the globe we

00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:19,049
have done good content creation we

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:23,729
created a fantastic video I think we

00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:27,710
have the link here be if we have the

00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:27,710
link we can show that later as well

00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:35,160
even guidelines which is the ongoing

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,960
work and some of them that we have

00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,520
already accomplished which I have

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,090
mentioned like the gender-neutral

00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:44,880
bathroom in the white room cetera we own

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,290
boarded few new contributors as well

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,640
because that was the need of the time

00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:54,060
and Nikhil puja and tactic ice back in

00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:57,920
the team so we have more energy and more

00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:00,900
resources in the team to work together

00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,610
we have also enhanced internal processes

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,890
in the team like the decision making

00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,980
process was not there now it is there

00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:11,690
and we still need to finalize it but yes

00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:14,010
that's their D I represent

00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:16,290
representative team representative and

00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:18,810
the council representative that is what

00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:22,200
we are working on the documentation and

00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:26,760
that side we are also improving our

00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:29,520
prison presence at flock is was always

00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,360
fantastic and this year as well we have

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,410
done a great job

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:38,100
we did it organize a transition session

00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:40,230
and we created a video and we are having

00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:47,160
this hackfest as well we did the coffee

00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:50,070
of its friends so that's about the walk

00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:53,790
which we have done so far and some of

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:55,950
them are still we are but you wanna know

00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:58,620
what is the aim of this head fest what

00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:03,210
we would like to take away from this HEC

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:07,320
fastest so you have seen that we have

00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:09,540
some of the tickets listed but they are

00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,600
not the things which we can accomplish

00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,940
within these two ours our main basic aim

00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,220
is to branch rainstorm what should be

00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,410
the next step for these tickets and take

00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,750
away the action items which we need to

00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:24,450
do because diversity and inclusion is

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,910
not a very easy and stateful topic it's

00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:30,150
not like a programming that if this has

00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:33,169
this true or false no it's it's a lot

00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:36,379
for effort of many people and many

00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:38,539
and many thoughtful processes that we

00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:41,110
would like to implement in the community

00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:44,300
to make it more diverse and inclusive

00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:46,939
without hurting anyone's sentiments so

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,919
it takes a lot of effort of everybody to

00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:52,550
brainstorm these ideas and come up with

00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:55,069
with the next steps and getting it

00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,590
approved from the council's and legals

00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:59,029
also takes time so that is not the aim

00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:01,400
to finish anything

00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:08,389
then the aim is to brainstorm these

00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:11,150
ideas and take it forward so as I told

00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:13,400
you earlier how do we do it we gonna go

00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:15,949
through the piece tickets one by one we

00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,810
give you the summary what we have done

00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:20,539
where we are at what is the next step

00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:23,360
we'll brainstorm about it and then some

00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:25,699
of you I think Justin told that he want

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,089
to do it he wants to do with that he

00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:30,469
will update the ticket accordingly

00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:35,389
whatever we have done for that ticket

00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:40,360
booth but all this we have helping hands

00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:44,930
who can help you with that okay so

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:46,969
without wasting further time let's get

00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:50,599
forward start with the first ticket the

00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:53,360
I team goals we have these goals listed

00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:56,509
and it's kind of divided into two parts

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,849
one part says our talks about what we

00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:04,060
would like to do or what we have done in

00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:07,099
the community and another is in specific

00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,639
so I would rather focus in this side

00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:09,889
Phest

00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,199
the first part and the second part

00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:14,479
weekend anyways have informal

00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:18,139
conversation within the team to

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,960
accomplish those goals so first of all

00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:24,129
is the outreach is summer called

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,860
internship this we have been sponsoring

00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:32,329
like the three years from three years

00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:34,220
now and we need to think about it and we

00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:36,200
need to come up

00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,270
we would like to continue doing it and

00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,060
if we would like to continue doing it

00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:44,390
how if we can improve this process more

00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:47,210
for the benefit of the community another

00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:49,760
one is the free development stay created

00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,420
content that will make impact in the

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,020
community

00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:57,290
so like the video creation blog blog

00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:59,750
post and such content which will reach

00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:03,580
to the people and educate them about the

00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:07,250
diversity and inclusion even guidelines

00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:11,080
and the translation on important content

00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:14,150
like for example Matthew Miller came up

00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:17,590
with the Fedora mission statement with

00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:22,340
with the new goals of the community but

00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:25,990
they be from the native language native

00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:29,360
speaker of English they end up using I

00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:32,440
mean not basic English maybe some jargon

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:36,950
switch which not everybody's aware of so

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:38,360
our aim is to reach to the all the

00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,610
people the maximum people of the

00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,190
community so that they understand this

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:47,650
important content so that is what we

00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:47,650
also would like to discuss about

00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:57,560
so here is the open questions we have

00:09:53,720 --> 00:10:00,840
what we would like to continue with

00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:05,490
these are the goals listed which we

00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:09,330
already have so out of these goals what

00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:13,500
we would like to continue with what we

00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:16,140
should improve on what we should stop

00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:20,160
doing and what we would like to

00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:21,810
interview new so this a section tactic

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,090
are you need to come over here in the

00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:27,810
last section what we would like to

00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:31,320
include new because we would like to

00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:33,660
hear the feedback which we gathered by

00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:53,130
the coffee sessions and we would like to

00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:56,520
know that what people would like us so I

00:10:53,130 --> 00:11:00,810
didn't come you have the slide man okay

00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:02,490
so it was there was not that many people

00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:07,860
but for me I think was more than enough

00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:12,360
was we had 8 people participating 5% 3

00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:14,730
we're online so for having such a short

00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,750
notice I think that it was it was a

00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:21,750
green but I had new people and I had all

00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:25,680
contributors so I got feedback from both

00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:29,400
sides of the coin most of the people

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:33,720
felt that they were comfortable in terms

00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:36,780
of inclusion inside the community half

00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:39,420
of the people felt that they had done

00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:43,580
something that had hurt someone in some

00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:47,730
way non-intentional inside the community

00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:50,960
but the cool part of that information

00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:54,000
was that since the creation of the

00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:56,940
entire of the diversity advisory

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,220
position they kind of started to over

00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,480
thinking a bit you know thinking a bit

00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,900
more about

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:09,270
how inclusive it was how their actions

00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:12,370
were and what were they doing with their

00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:14,560
other members of the community so it was

00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:17,830
good that at least the creation of the

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:22,450
position kind of put them into reality

00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:25,210
that there is people who needs who has

00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:27,850
their needs their likes their shares and

00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:33,790
all that they that we are all different

00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:36,670
so what I felt

00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:38,650
well that one of the questions were what

00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:43,500
do you think about the Fedora diversity

00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:47,260
and inclusion team is doing well and I

00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:49,870
have only been in this conference in a

00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:52,120
long time but most people said that

00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:55,210
evens had more information for making

00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:59,260
people feel more comfortable including

00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:03,930
the the tax and all of that but they

00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:07,110
pointed out that there is still some non

00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:11,260
cooperative relationships on the big

00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:13,420
support social channels meaning big IRC

00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:17,710
channels big big telegram channels like

00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:19,840
big ones they usually get some not

00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:22,870
harassment but meaning comments that

00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,940
should not be there the bigger the crew

00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:28,750
the harder to handle so it's kind of

00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:31,870
understandable but now with more that

00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:35,310
means I know that it's easier to to

00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,310
solve that in a short amount of time

00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:42,160
what I did had a feeling in the

00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:45,850
community in this probably is not too

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:49,710
related to the diversity team but I

00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:53,590
don't know if we can do something there

00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:58,650
was that they were worried about the

00:13:53,590 --> 00:14:01,360
drop-off rate they were worried that the

00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:03,910
activities that they have been doing in

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,000
the past two or three years have been

00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,030
mostly putting down some fires instead

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,980
doing you

00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:15,580
things and the overall feeling of the

00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:18,350
members that I could interview was that

00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:23,090
they felt comfortable but they were

00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:26,810
quite bored so again probably not

00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:28,850
diversity but it is inclusion so we need

00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:31,430
to make people feel included into

00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:33,560
something that has meaning to be part of

00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:37,670
a community because at the end isn't

00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:42,490
that what is this all about so maybe we

00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:45,350
as a an inclusion team can work on

00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:49,940
providing more challenges making the

00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:52,220
right connection between teams and the

00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:54,620
making of connections between teams that

00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:57,650
probably are not related in some levels

00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,000
it's going to make them not just feel

00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,830
that they have a purpose inside a

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,580
community and that they are doing new

00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:07,880
things but also will allow people to

00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:09,650
also made new people inside a community

00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,500
and have a different approach of the

00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:15,230
reality of each one so we will be not

00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:18,770
only making them do something but

00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:21,410
knowing people and that's probably what

00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:26,210
we should be doing on a regular basis on

00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:30,670
this thing that was mostly the input I

00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:33,200
would like to continue with this I

00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,940
cannot say that word because it's going

00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,860
to be recorded so with this

00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,440
conversations this informal

00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,360
conversations for a bit longer

00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:45,440
probably a couple of months I know some

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:50,450
people who has something to share but

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:53,270
probably do time and a bit of panic they

00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:57,680
didn't share it and have a better input

00:15:53,270 --> 00:16:00,250
with at least 30 or 40 people that that

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,690
we can reach out and have a bigger

00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:05,330
multiple but I think that that was

00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:09,110
really good information for having just

00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:11,510
a couple of people dozen people a year

00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,950
putting together the word that we cannot

00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:16,480
say and all the information that we

00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,480
cannot gather but it's there

00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:37,790
the first section I think because like a

00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,680
frenemy microphone Amida you make me

00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,810
using like a franca I wasn't like so

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,840
these are the things which are listed in

00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:46,580
the first half of the section are which

00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,610
we have been doing so far

00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:52,550
these are the things which have impact

00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:56,420
in the diversity part of the DI team and

00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:58,880
I feel that diversity is already there

00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:02,180
now we are already there now I mean look

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,850
around around you and see the difference

00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:07,459
in the numbers of of the ratio of

00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:10,550
different kind of people now it is time

00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:15,320
to shift our focus a little bit to the

00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:18,650
inclusion side and adding a goal for

00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:21,440
that which tactical also brought up a

00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:23,839
fair point here they're talking to

00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,730
different people this is this is the

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,040
topic or this is the thing where we

00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:33,770
would like to focus more and at least

00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:36,800
add a goal for the next year in for the

00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:40,760
team so what do you think what what it

00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:42,970
can be that will resolve this problem

00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,970
and

00:17:54,270 --> 00:18:01,500
I think one of the things that because

00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,820
of our our team size I think one of the

00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,180
things that we are in a unique position

00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:09,120
to do especially if you look at the

00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:10,770
council flowchart or that the in the

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,370
council Docs there's the flowchart of

00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:16,200
the broader Fedora community and where

00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:19,170
the diversity inclusion team is seated

00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:22,050
we have this really great opportunity to

00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:25,890
help these other higher level bodies in

00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:27,660
Fedora Drive policy and like think about

00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:30,990
things that are outside of their day to

00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,520
day work right so I think that's been in

00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:35,780
the back of my mind is instead of us

00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:39,650
trying to take on new work as a team

00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:42,120
maybe shifting our focus towards

00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:43,980
advising other groups like so like

00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,990
specifically around mind share like what

00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,670
what came up in tactic has feedback

00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,530
about making better connections between

00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:52,860
teams that are unrelated to each other

00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:55,140
as an equity to that like and today in

00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,270
the badges hackfest we had these three

00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,790
groups of people for the longest time

00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,530
have not had conversations together we

00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:03,900
had the designers of the Fedora badges

00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,730
we had the infrastructure team and we

00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,100
had programmer like the developers

00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:10,710
working or people who are more familiar

00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,570
of the development of badges all sitting

00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:14,280
in the same room and talking together

00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:16,710
for the first time that I've seen in

00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,510
like six years and it's like that's the

00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:20,760
kind of engagement I think that we can

00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,290
want that we want to encourage and I

00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,940
think one way that we can try to

00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,170
influence as out is like we can see

00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,330
these things or we can come up with

00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:29,520
suggestions and work with the mindshare

00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:32,280
committee who is charged with this

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,770
specific task in the Fedora community

00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,720
and work with them as partners and co

00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:38,970
collaborators and trying to push some of

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,900
this forward same thing with the fedora

00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:44,700
council outside of the like better

00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,710
connections with teams there was some

00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,270
else so like the the telegram or like

00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:52,440
not it was a telegram specifically but

00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:56,910
the user communities aspect that is a

00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:59,220
really hard and very high burnout area I

00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,720
think about managing like for example we

00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:05,280
have these user communities and there

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,260
was this big keeping short there's a lot

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,690
of these really huge you

00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,400
communities I think have good intentions

00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:12,140
in the beginning but then suddenly they

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,390
grow to this point where it's very

00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,980
difficult for them to manage and I think

00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:18,230
it might help to come up with some

00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:20,540
recommendations and guidelines for

00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:22,400
community moderation you know if we have

00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:26,810
a code of conduct but what happens if

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:31,250
you are like a smaller piece or in a

00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:33,080
smaller group in Fedora and you take the

00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:35,660
code of conduct and use the Fedora logo

00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,700
you know okay we have it when then you

00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,140
enter a situation where it's obviously

00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:42,530
like what's happening in the group or

00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:44,660
the chat is not compliant or it's it's

00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:46,040
it's not great behavior it's not being

00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,890
people being excellent to each other and

00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,420
then it's kind of like like the thing

00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,760
that was documenting the code of conduct

00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:55,400
now is okay open a ticket with the

00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,080
Fedora Council which it works well if

00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,850
it's or it's better that's better suited

00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,110
if it's within the contributor community

00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:02,540
but what about when it's a user

00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:04,700
community you know like it's like oh

00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,440
there's this telegram user who I have no

00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,660
idea who this is random person on the

00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,640
internet who harassed me and like well I

00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,530
mean it's a problem but there's not like

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,760
a it's not a thing that fedora council

00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:17,000
can you know oh but you open a ticket

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,440
with the council right so one thing I

00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,410
think we could suggest with the fedora

00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,300
council to do is what we're seeing these

00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:24,860
things so maybe we should suggest it and

00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,440
like open a ticket or open a proposal

00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,630
with them draft community moderation

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,510
guidelines so if you are one of these

00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:34,010
derivative communities in Fedora because

00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:38,780
we are such a huge community and there's

00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:41,600
no reasonable way that we can keep eyes

00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,850
on everything you know how can we

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,090
empower the people who have good

00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:50,060
intentions and want to be good community

00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:51,950
leads to do the right thing without acts

00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,840
like without feeling overwhelmed or

00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,070
getting burned out when it's grown to a

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,600
point where like they can't keep up with

00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:58,610
it anymore and it has a life of its own

00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,050
like I mean I think that was some of the

00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,790
user communities I've moderated and

00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:05,090
Fedora and Beyond like that's a problem

00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:06,920
a lot of communities in open-source in

00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,750
technology anywhere are having that

00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,360
problem and like I think it would be

00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,890
really great it'd be standing on the

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,910
shoulders of other giants like Mozilla

00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:15,740
has done I think

00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:18,290
a really great set of guidelines around

00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,580
this so we wouldn't have to reinvent the

00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:21,170
wheel but we could think of like what

00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:23,720
does that look like for the Fedora

00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:25,490
community but instead of our team being

00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,380
the one let's sit down and draft these

00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:29,120
guidelines I think we need to find our

00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:31,910
partners in the community that we can

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,910
have as our Co collaborators and I see

00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:36,380
like thinking of the flow chart with the

00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:38,090
fedora council in the middle of the

00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,430
engineering branch and we have the

00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:43,250
mindshare branch like I see the mine

00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:46,700
share and fedora council and Bess go to

00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:48,440
some extent - those are our partners

00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:53,000
right those are our areas where we can

00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:55,790
try to add perspective to these higher

00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,710
level places in the community to try to

00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:59,390
effect positive change and hopefully

00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,570
have it be a trickle down you know if

00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:04,700
you see the graph have that flow chart

00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:07,760
work its way down into these smaller

00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:09,680
pieces instead of trying to like take

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,910
each of these I which I actually should

00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,250
put that in the slides now I think about

00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:14,180
it it's a really great visual but it's

00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,100
just like you see all these different

00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:18,170
arms you know branching out in so many

00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,370
different directions and maybe for a

00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,750
long time we've been thinking like

00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:22,490
instead of looking at the individual

00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:24,710
pieces like each arm and be like okay

00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:26,180
well how can we make things good here or

00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:28,400
make things better here well maybe we

00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:30,800
should look at like move the feedback

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,480
loop into the top and hope try to affect

00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,790
change that way and I feel like now I'm

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,720
just kind of repeating myself but that's

00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,130
just I mean that cane of my and I

00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,020
listening to that feedback like there's

00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:40,400
a lot of things I've been like that's

00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,570
kind of in my mind if it like the back

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,370
of my mind with some of the user

00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:45,110
communities I'm in on like I'm telegram

00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:47,150
just because that's what I use more and

00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:49,100
it's just like it's at a point now or

00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:51,380
it's like sometimes I'm just so

00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,360
overwhelmed and like you know I look

00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:56,240
away for an hour and now there's 200

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,190
messages and like I can't read all those

00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,540
and let alone like I know there's

00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:02,390
probably things in there that are not

00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:04,220
really comfortable with but it's just

00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:05,870
like I don't have the tools in my

00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:08,060
toolbox right now and like I mean I

00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:10,160
could sit down and like draft these

00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,240
guidelines for telegram but then it's

00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,070
going to be I'm gonna be in my own

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,870
little niche and I'm sure there's other

00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:17,420
places other teams that could use these

00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:19,370
things that would have you know would be

00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,990
really helpful to have guidelines and

00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:23,040
and here's the I don't know if we can

00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:24,840
link that somewhere like in the

00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:30,270
diversity chat maybe in the channel just

00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:31,620
put a link to that that image but like I

00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:33,000
that's coming that's been the back of my

00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,190
mind because I think for a long time

00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,350
we've tried to take this very hands-on

00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:39,030
approach to doing these things ourselves

00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,650
and sometimes that's the right approach

00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,570
ik Fedora Women's Day I think is a great

00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:45,720
example of that because that's like a

00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:47,250
very collaborative I think it's a great

00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,380
example the kind of things that we as

00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,630
our team can do and like have an impact

00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:54,330
on but when it comes to these really big

00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:56,700
challenges of and maybe this could be

00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:57,960
one way I don't want to I don't know we

00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,980
can probably come back to the event

00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,630
guidelines like but that could be one

00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,179
example of like we can work with you

00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:06,050
know the fedora council as maybe that's

00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:08,040
like one direction to push those forward

00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:11,720
I have a question

00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:15,620
so going back and do all the things that

00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:18,900
we could approach and try to help with

00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:23,610
will the burnout rate be something that

00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:27,240
it's in our side of the of the work 13

00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:29,460
yeah or is more into all their community

00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,500
because it's not like we are going to

00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,270
recruit more people that's marketing and

00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:37,190
buzzing doors are advocates whatever the

00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:41,910
problem that it's going to handle Dallas

00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:48,210
but burnout rate the drop-off rate who

00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:49,470
is in charge of it so I want to I want

00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,970
to pull some there's something that a

00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:53,370
really interesting term that I was

00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:55,320
reading about a while ago and it's when

00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:59,670
your this team is in a unique role

00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:01,800
because I think we are we hear more

00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:03,330
about the things that are bad or

00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,059
negative like when there's problems in

00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:08,309
the community we get it or we you we see

00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:10,740
that negative feedback more than maybe

00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:13,230
the fedora council would and we as a

00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:16,350
team but we as individual people in the

00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:18,840
Fedora community and so there's this

00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:20,820
term like being a toxic handling right

00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,850
and this is something that can exist in

00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:26,220
any organization any open-source project

00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:30,380
but the idea is that the toxic handler

00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:33,480
is the kind of person who provides like

00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:35,669
informal not it's not like a role that

00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,990
you were given or assigned but you

00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:41,210
happen to receive a lot of like neg

00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:43,710
psychological effects of like negative

00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:45,210
feedback around like different things

00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,559
that are toxic in a workplace

00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:49,559
environment or in an open source

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,059
community and so like I think that

00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:53,309
that's definitely something that we as a

00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:57,300
team should be mindful of is that we do

00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:59,130
see probably a different perspective on

00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:01,320
some of the things happening in the

00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:03,270
community just because we notice a not

00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,470
saying like everything's terrible I

00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:07,080
guess not what I'm saying at all but

00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:08,460
like we just have to think we are more

00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:13,559
in the loop on some of that that

00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:15,419
feedback and I see the council mindshare

00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:20,490
way of trying to drive the discussion

00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:25,080
forward that could be a way to try to

00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:26,460
reduce that a little bit that's what I

00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,110
think like that would help us be mindful

00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,309
of that realizing that we do see a lot

00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,690
of that instead of us try and like

00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:32,280
internalize that and think of like how

00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,169
do we how does the diversity inclusion

00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,000
team solve this let's work with our

00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:37,980
partners in our co-collaborators the

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,020
mindshare committee a federal council

00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,790
may be at some point like one

00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,620
relationship I would love to think about

00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:45,570
is like how confess Co and the diversity

00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,490
inclusion team work together like

00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:50,610
because we don't we don't do anything

00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:51,929
really and that is a huge part like if

00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:55,429
you look at the flow chart that was

00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:59,790
linked in the channel like that's huge

00:27:55,429 --> 00:28:02,490
so I got your point with that I just

00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:06,600
want to remind that for each topic we

00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:08,400
have 45 minutes for for two topics we

00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:11,640
have 45 minutes and then the topic we

00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,500
have like 30 minutes or so so we would

00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:17,700
like to stick to the timelines as well

00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:19,679
for that is a very great perspective

00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,169
what I what is the takeaway from that is

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,870
I think what we can do is there are two

00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:28,320
part of it one is taking the guidelines

00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:31,980
which are done by our other partners in

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,780
DI space in open source and sharing

00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:36,179
those guidelines with the rest of the

00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:40,320
community people like fresco or the

00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:43,230
mindshare community teams who can help

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:46,290
us implement those guidelines to

00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:48,840
different teams and six so that is what

00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:53,040
is the basic idea which I got from your

00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:54,470
point of view I also would like to say

00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:58,470
about inclusion

00:28:54,470 --> 00:29:00,840
this tactic ah which you have initiated

00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:03,990
a coffee with friends I think we should

00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:06,810
we can make it an ongoing activity we

00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:09,120
can do it open a window once in a month

00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:11,610
or once in a three months that this is

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,429
the time one week or where

00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:17,310
few offers are available from the DI

00:29:14,429 --> 00:29:19,380
team to have coffee with friends and to

00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:21,840
listen to their ideas and their pain

00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,510
points and things and there we can get

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,130
what what are the actual things are

00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:29,520
happening in the community to get that

00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:31,860
idea so that we can address them with

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,750
the proper guidelines and not bombarding

00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:38,929
them with a lot of guidelines which are

00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:38,929
not required in our community was their

00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:45,080
anonymous form kind of thing like an

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,080
online like

00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:55,050
mm-hmm maybe we can just open a Google

00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:57,059
phone kind of thing that you can submit

00:29:55,050 --> 00:30:07,200
your request to have to have a coffee

00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:11,510
with friend like like anyone in how

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,510
implementation part but I think

00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:29,570
whatever we are so we will have the

00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:31,429
people from in the DI team we have nice

00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:33,950
blend of people from different time

00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:36,110
zones so they can choose pick and choose

00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:40,190
who is their favorite one and where is

00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:42,230
the comfortable time for them and I

00:30:40,190 --> 00:31:13,220
would just like to add one more

00:30:42,230 --> 00:31:15,830
suggestion to this so I just wanted to

00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:18,590
say like we already have the Federer

00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:21,409
happiness packets project so maybe we

00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:23,600
can use that more or link it linked to

00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:25,879
it more so that people use it so they

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,990
know there's also a way to like

00:31:25,879 --> 00:31:31,370
appreciate others so like we decided to

00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:34,159
create this so that people in the

00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:36,289
community like Satan thanks more to each

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,000
other and appreciate each other for they

00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:40,639
work more and one thing we are trying to

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,700
do like from what Justin said is like

00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:46,399
making different groups interact so if

00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:48,559
they have like already interacted or if

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,029
they have even like the note of each

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,220
other's work I think this would be a

00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:54,500
good way to like start those small

00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,330
interactions or at least so show some

00:31:54,500 --> 00:32:02,000
appreciation so the people who are

00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:03,559
feeling like too bold or too like mmm

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,740
they're having like negative thoughts

00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:08,330
them they might start feeling more a bit

00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:11,889
more positive about the community

00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:14,210
experience so if we can just link to the

00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:17,750
federal happiness packets website

00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:20,690
somewhere or like put it somewhere more

00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:23,649
visible which people can use regularly I

00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:27,559
think it would be a good thing to do -

00:32:23,649 --> 00:32:29,870
yeah okay so if somebody has taking

00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:33,289
notes the action item or the takeaway

00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:35,330
for fro for this one is like we should

00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:37,100
make the coffee with friend activity

00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:38,960
continuous activity with

00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:41,000
come back to the implementation part

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,809
later that how we would like to do it

00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,150
once in two months or so next is the

00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:49,299
guidelines for taking the guidelines

00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:52,070
from the different communities and

00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:55,010
sharing them with the with the other

00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:57,350
groups in Fedora which are appropriate

00:32:55,010 --> 00:33:00,650
or which are required for federal

00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:05,179
community and the last one which I would

00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:09,140
like to okay that that's a different

00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:10,549
totally different one the like we have

00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:12,919
been to in the federal Women's Day and

00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:15,470
on the similar line we are have we are

00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:18,530
successful to doing that so I would like

00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:21,679
to initiate one more event or once a

00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:24,110
year from our team that is LGBTQ II but

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:28,030
that that also depends on our bandwidth

00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:30,679
and and how we would like to do it just

00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:32,150
I was just going to say one action item

00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:34,280
I think we should also take away from

00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:38,270
that as I feel like we have a lot of

00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:40,250
things in our issue tracker that while

00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:41,870
they're good ideas I think we might need

00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,669
to reconsider how we want to approach

00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:45,559
them and I see you're thinking of it

00:33:43,669 --> 00:33:48,200
from the perspective of how can we

00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:50,780
partner with other groups so I think the

00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,580
action item is review our all of our

00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:54,559
like tickets that have been open for a

00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:57,679
really long time we've been stuck on the

00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:01,909
ones that are older than eight months a

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:04,039
year and figure out like can we as a as

00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:06,200
a small team that we are push these

00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:10,220
things forward or do we need to find

00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:11,659
partners to help us like move this

00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:14,260
feedback in a place where it can be

00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:14,260
acted on

00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:29,020
what we would like to stop doing what we

00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:31,060
need to eliminate so so I can action I

00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:32,920
can I could take that action item to do

00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,400
like a preliminary review through all

00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,650
right

00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:38,440
or a holistic review through all of our

00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:40,270
tickets and put some feedback in like

00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,470
for questions to ask and then we could

00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:44,230
review them at a meeting or

00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:47,980
asynchronously later on I think what we

00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:50,920
can do is we can make repo of the ears

00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:52,780
like the current ear the goals we have

00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:56,290
discussed we should have the issues of

00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:59,640
those goals in under that year only and

00:34:56,290 --> 00:35:03,160
the next year we have another one so

00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:06,220
even if we have some ticket or the idea

00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:08,710
for the future one we just keep it in

00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:11,770
the separate repo so that we don't go

00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:27,010
there and spend time over there I'm not

00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:28,960
sure if I follow the suggestion which is

00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:31,210
something that every team is suffering

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:35,380
in Fedora like including fiscal for

00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:37,750
example design so like we can kind of

00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:40,050
have it as a test for our team seeing

00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:43,900
how to make the onboarding easier and

00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:46,030
having also like people that they were

00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:48,130
very active in our team but they were

00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:50,320
kind of burned out or whatever and they

00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:52,180
are not active anymore even like what

00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,830
approach to have even for that is

00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,060
something that will be helpful not only

00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:58,060
for our team

00:35:55,060 --> 00:36:00,160
but for every team in federal and it's

00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:03,160
something super helpful and I think like

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:06,430
super important that we can work on yeah

00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:09,220
for all the teams exactly that's a very

00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:11,710
good point even a while back I was like

00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:13,630
hesitant to send an email you remember

00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:16,450
that right and we have to do it because

00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:17,950
we I had talked with discussion with Ben

00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:20,440
cotton which I need to share in the

00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:21,910
upcoming slides about the elections and

00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,070
he was talking to me about the

00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:27,280
eligibility of the wood how people

00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:28,840
should vote on what criteria so I would

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,640
like to keep it in within the team I

00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,440
would like to know your perspective as

00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,750
well for the diversity advisor

00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:37,299
not many other people know the community

00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:39,789
know that what RDI advisor does and who

00:36:37,299 --> 00:36:41,980
it is that probably person for that but

00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:45,160
for that we need to clean our fast group

00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:46,779
right so and it was very difficult for

00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,750
me to send out that email I have never

00:36:46,779 --> 00:36:51,609
done it it is my draft so we have if we

00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,839
have the process in place we just need

00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:57,099
to follow that right

00:36:52,839 --> 00:37:01,869
we will not be like hesitant for

00:36:57,099 --> 00:37:05,559
implementing what is correct okay you

00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:07,990
will be taking care of cleaning the

00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:09,339
implementation I was in stasis the time

00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:11,589
check we're at three minutes till the

00:37:09,339 --> 00:37:16,869
first 45 minute mark so I was thinking

00:37:11,589 --> 00:37:18,759
maybe we can sew this are thinking like

00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:20,410
for the the general Golz maybe we can

00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:22,599
recap all of our action I am that we

00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:25,000
were just discussing and then wrap up

00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:27,789
here and move on to the event deadlines

00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,950
next so do you have all the action items

00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:31,900
up there on your end I have you want to

00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:36,130
read them out the coffee with friends

00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:38,019
we're gonna make it ongoing activity the

00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:40,450
second one is the guidelines we're gonna

00:37:38,019 --> 00:37:43,119
create bring in the guidelines the first

00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:45,759
one to start it with cleaning of the

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,130
fests or keeping that up to date that is

00:37:45,759 --> 00:37:49,599
the guideline we can go and look up to

00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:53,890
the different company communities and

00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:58,119
share it with our community groups the

00:37:53,890 --> 00:38:00,549
third one is making more connection with

00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:03,990
how do we develop more connection with

00:38:00,549 --> 00:38:06,940
the existing groups like my chair and

00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:08,950
Vesco the fourth one is which we have

00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:10,420
not discussed but we can still open or

00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:13,269
ticket and discuss over there is the

00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:21,819
LGBTQ event how we want to do it or if

00:38:13,269 --> 00:38:23,950
we want to do it as a team or okay and I

00:38:21,819 --> 00:38:27,009
guess also the like ticket triage as

00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:29,349
well was that a fifth one yes yes cool

00:38:27,009 --> 00:38:32,559
so do we want to put names on those for

00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:34,630
now or we want to try to time box I

00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:38,500
think we can we can we should put names

00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:41,769
that will be the best thing ticket

00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:44,490
triage so for the ticket triage I can I

00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:46,210
can follow up on our past ones and

00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,710
rethink about how

00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:49,900
I feel like in some ways maybe that's

00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:52,240
related to the working together maybe

00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,470
that's two action items in one because

00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,730
it's really thinking how can we

00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,660
collaborate with other communities well

00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:56,920
I think that's also looking at the

00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,990
things that we're doing already and

00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,360
seeing where can we push those like

00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:03,130
either can we do them or do we need to

00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,770
work with another group would you say

00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:09,430
that they're the same which do the

00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:10,930
sidelines one and the group cross all

00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,790
right thinking about how we can start

00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:14,830
collaborating with other other sub

00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:17,710
projects in Fedora like connecting them

00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:18,940
together and and driving that through

00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:21,670
like the other committees like mind

00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:23,410
share Council and me going through our

00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:25,000
ticket triage and thinking of that going

00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:29,890
in with that perspective makes sense

00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:33,430
okay this dwarf of Justin LGBTQ II event

00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:35,530
I can take if anybody wants to take

00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:38,050
please feel free

00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:40,150
there's coffee with friends I guess

00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:43,380
tactical you can take that up because

00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:48,280
you started it thank you

00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:50,860
guidelines for different things though I

00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:53,650
am okay nickel and puta to take it up

00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:56,490
but I feel somebody who has a little bit

00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:59,380
more experience should be helping them

00:39:56,490 --> 00:40:01,540
because you you will know the other

00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:04,770
communities more than them so you need

00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:08,170
to help them so Jana will help just in a

00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:11,290
nickel and pooja for that so nickel and

00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:14,040
pooja will be doing that and you know

00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:14,040
will be helping them

00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:38,959
so we are good here I think so cool

00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:48,939
I would like to invite B don't make

00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:48,939
anybody fall hello

00:40:52,359 --> 00:41:06,289
don't fall again please so now I'll be

00:41:04,249 --> 00:41:10,189
talking a little bit about the fedora

00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:14,539
even guidelines so we we have been

00:41:10,189 --> 00:41:18,829
working on this since the since last two

00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:21,859
years almost now and so the aim for this

00:41:18,829 --> 00:41:25,309
is that we want to make like Fedora

00:41:21,859 --> 00:41:27,589
events more diverse and inclusive so we

00:41:25,309 --> 00:41:29,989
want to provide a set of guidelines to

00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:35,569
event organizers within our community on

00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:38,150
how they can do this and I I had like

00:41:35,569 --> 00:41:41,089
last year at flop we presented like some

00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:42,769
draft of these guidelines however like

00:41:41,089 --> 00:41:44,509
we had received a lot of feedback on it

00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:46,939
and then now we have decided to

00:41:44,509 --> 00:41:48,319
rehydrate and here is the second draft

00:41:46,939 --> 00:41:51,380
proposal for this

00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:55,909
so I before so the link for the draft is

00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:58,369
their link which I recommend you to all

00:41:55,909 --> 00:42:04,900
open because we'll be having an activity

00:41:58,369 --> 00:42:07,880
based on the draft proposal now okay and

00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:10,729
so I just want to just highlight these

00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:13,309
two points before we before you read the

00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:16,549
draft the first thing is that like the

00:42:13,309 --> 00:42:18,529
draft proposal is for like oil event

00:42:16,549 --> 00:42:20,959
organizers who are a part of Federer

00:42:18,529 --> 00:42:23,150
community so if you are organizing a

00:42:20,959 --> 00:42:27,019
Federer event like a fedora release

00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:30,109
party or like Federer women's day or

00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:33,319
even flop it's applicable to them so the

00:42:30,109 --> 00:42:36,799
scale of events ranges from like local

00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:40,249
events say like 10 to 20 people to flock

00:42:36,799 --> 00:42:42,120
which is like 500 I don't know 100

00:42:40,249 --> 00:42:45,120
people but like pretty big

00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:47,340
so uh and another thing is like all

00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:49,650
these guidelines are suggestions they

00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:51,540
are nothing is mandatory here we want to

00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:53,910
discuss more about how we implement this

00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:56,910
if we want to make something mandatory

00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:58,740
or like how we ensure that community

00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:01,410
goes through this and tries to work

00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:03,630
through this but right now they are all

00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:06,000
like written up as suggestions nothing

00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:09,150
is mandatory and we I would love your

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:14,580
feedback on the whole draft proposal so

00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:18,270
I have created a small activity based on

00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:22,110
how we can how you can give feedback for

00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:26,630
this our draft so the first thing I want

00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:30,420
you to do is just go through the I in

00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:32,850
beginning sections introduction in the

00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:35,160
note on leaving feedback and how to use

00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:36,810
this guide I want like everyone to read

00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,880
this section so then you get a basic

00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:41,460
overview of what the guidelines are

00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,700
about and how to go through the proposal

00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:48,240
the next thing I want to do is pick a

00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:50,340
section of interest whichever you like

00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,560
ideally we would all pick different

00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:56,390
sections so that we can have different

00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:59,430
recommendations from each section and

00:43:56,390 --> 00:44:02,850
for that section I want you to go

00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:05,460
through like all the guidelines in that

00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:10,170
section and evaluate based on these

00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:12,810
three questions ABC so first one is like

00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:15,990
is this is the language clear is it

00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:19,700
understandable can you do know what it's

00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:22,020
saying the second one is for this

00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:24,120
suggestion what do you think like what

00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:26,100
would be the efforts required and what

00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:28,670
would be the impact you think it could

00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:31,800
have would it be low medium or high and

00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:34,590
I would prefer that you think like as

00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:38,280
you are organizer of a fedora release

00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:39,810
party so on a small scale so things like

00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,580
your you are going to organize the

00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:43,530
Fedora release party in your local

00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:45,450
community and like do you think you can

00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:47,310
implement this guideline what would be

00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:50,010
the efforts required from you what

00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:52,380
impact would you have and if you

00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:55,160
identify a low effort but like high

00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:58,989
impact guideline just

00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:01,940
put a small Apple near it and if you

00:44:58,989 --> 00:45:04,430
identify a high effort high impact

00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:06,680
guideline put a green checkmark near it

00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:07,220
we already have some of these in the

00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,279
document

00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:12,920
feel free to if some if you don't think

00:45:10,279 --> 00:45:15,829
some of the suggestions are tagged

00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:19,819
accurately feel free to write it down

00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:21,950
I'll pass you all sticky notes so you'll

00:45:19,819 --> 00:45:24,319
know about it and we can then discuss

00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:26,900
this later the third thing I want you to

00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:28,549
think about is like what more resources

00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,259
do you need to implement this do you

00:45:28,549 --> 00:45:32,839
need any support from the diversity and

00:45:30,259 --> 00:45:34,940
inclusion team or from somewhere outside

00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:37,489
of fedora or just do you need to do a

00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:39,559
lot of research work in on the internet

00:45:37,489 --> 00:45:41,359
to implement this and so it you don't

00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:43,880
think it would be feasible for you to do

00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:47,359
this so I want you to think of these

00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:50,599
three questions for each guideline in

00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:52,759
the section you select and one another

00:45:50,599 --> 00:45:55,999
broad thing I would like to use your

00:45:52,759 --> 00:45:57,859
thoughts on is that like the evaluation

00:45:55,999 --> 00:46:00,469
method like we discussed like should we

00:45:57,859 --> 00:46:02,539
have all these as suggestions but then

00:46:00,469 --> 00:46:04,460
if all of them are suggestions how do we

00:46:02,539 --> 00:46:07,969
actually ensure that the community tries

00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:10,579
to do some of them at least so so do

00:46:07,969 --> 00:46:14,569
bees encourage people to implement like

00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:18,440
all of the low effort ones or like how

00:46:14,569 --> 00:46:20,210
do we go on about this so please think

00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:23,539
about like the implementation

00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:25,609
suggestions - and then after 15-20

00:46:23,539 --> 00:46:28,880
minutes after you have gone through the

00:46:25,609 --> 00:46:31,210
selected section we can review the

00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,210
feedback

00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:43,050
yeah so if you can just tell me I will

00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,050
write down here what section you choose

00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:57,940
so Yona sequent COC feel free to take a

00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:59,860
smaller subsection to because sections

00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:01,840
are sometimes too long but then take

00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:25,900
like multiple ones so that it's not too

00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:31,260
small then tactical again Nikol wants

00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:31,260
even open the issue tracker

00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:45,260
I'm eatin do you want a section

00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:55,710
it's yeah don't mean to read out all the

00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:58,890
sections for everyone in the room or we

00:47:55,710 --> 00:48:02,010
split them up so we have an organizing

00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:07,470
committee we have venue selection and

00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:10,640
on-site services catering COC she own is

00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:13,490
doing participant and speaker selection

00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:17,099
event registration Nikhil's doing that

00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:21,480
childcare inclusive practices during

00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:24,359
check-in grants scholarships assessments

00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:26,520
of the event and then none of the

00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:40,230
resources are all there is resources one

00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:42,119
or all three of them okay so yes it

00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:45,470
would be nice to have your feedback here

00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:45,470
too in person so

00:48:50,040 --> 00:49:04,350
you want to be good selection would you

00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:08,300
I want to speaker selection inclusive

00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:08,300
practices during check-in for tactical

00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:31,260
no she's doing childcare so that's good

00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:33,780
so it leaves we have organizing

00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:51,750
committee venue selection and on-site

00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:53,280
services open the section I'll pass you

00:49:51,750 --> 00:50:01,800
sticky notes if you have any feedback

00:49:53,280 --> 00:50:06,030
right on the sticky notes so yeah you

00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:13,410
can do COC and organizing committee

00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:16,500
together yep you can add organizing

00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:21,000
committee for Jana I can do scholarships

00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:25,500
and grants figure out you be a student

00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,930
again so that leaves us with we still

00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:31,380
have catering which looks like a pretty

00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:33,090

we have provided some guidelines to the

00:52:31,049 --> 00:52:36,329
council and the event organizers that

00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:38,279
these should be included while doing the

00:52:36,329 --> 00:52:41,160
events so we have more guidelines and

00:52:38,279 --> 00:52:43,499
for under catering also we have provided

00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:45,210
some guidelines and we have written it

00:52:43,499 --> 00:52:48,170
in the dog we would like to have your

00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:52,200
feedback on that thank you very much I

hope everybody knows what to do so let's

00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,589
start

00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:02,700
[Music]

00:52:58,549 --> 00:53:07,289
what is training what is it for when you

00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:09,329
say training you have so usually like in

00:53:07,289 --> 00:53:10,950
other conferences what I have seen for

00:53:09,329 --> 00:53:13,440
speaker training is that they have a

00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:15,749
session a 30-minute like video call or a

00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,460
virtual session with new speakers who

00:53:15,749 --> 00:53:19,319
are like first time speakers they

00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:21,479
provide them like say these templates

00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:24,259
they give them guidelines on how you

00:53:21,479 --> 00:53:24,259
should like

00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:31,810
slides how you should speak what is okay

00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:35,829
what is not okay okay okay this you need

00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:40,270
much training with templates and with

00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:43,060
the expertise because when you send a

00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:48,339
new member of the community to the first

00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:51,599
talk release party I go with this member

00:53:48,339 --> 00:53:55,030
to the university to the release party

00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:58,680
whatever I go and I say okay no problem

00:53:55,030 --> 00:54:03,730
stay here speak I hope I have this guy

00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:05,440
this is yeah but you just this is sort

00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:08,200
of training but you are doing it as a

00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,420
mentor like for one person we want to do

00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:12,790
it for everybody like in a generalized

00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:15,250
way because sometimes not everybody

00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:18,160
might know you okay to do that

00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:19,960
so we just want to offer like some

00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,000
template some resources that you can

00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:25,000
read through this links if you are a new

00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,530
speaker and this will be helpful for how

00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,359
many years you have in the community a

00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:33,310
lot ten years ten years in the community

00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:37,030
you remember you remember the wiki page

00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:39,430
have a lot of templates for your science

00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:41,710
yes it's like template well I I think

00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:43,930
that's a conversation that we would want

00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:45,490
I think that it's a that's a great

00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:48,849
feedback I think that's the kind of like

00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:49,900
that would be like I think maybe we

00:54:48,849 --> 00:54:51,369
should try to take some of this feedback

00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,230
and come up with like our action items

00:54:51,369 --> 00:54:55,780
just as a time check because we have 45

00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:57,280
minutes I'm thinking like because that

00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:58,599
would actually be like like Lewis like

00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,460
that would be great feedback for the

00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:01,810
mindshare committee because you know

00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:04,690
they're they're the team that's trying

00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:06,280
to like make the you know going out to

00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:07,930
talk about fedora and make doing these

00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:10,450
things easier for people and that's

00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:12,010
exactly the kind of feedback that you

00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:13,540
know be like hey I'm trying to find

00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:16,089
these things and like I don't know where

00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:17,829
they are anymore that is like totally

00:55:16,089 --> 00:55:19,990
justifiable and that's the kind of thing

00:55:17,829 --> 00:55:21,369
to mindshare committee should be I

00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:23,020
really wish I could jump into their

00:55:21,369 --> 00:55:27,670
hackfest or their their workshop right

00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:30,250
now but specifically I don't think mine

00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:32,660
sure will have to do anything you should

00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:35,059
just fill the ticket with the sign

00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:36,410
for that kind of resources on do it no

00:55:35,059 --> 00:55:40,240
but I think because they're already

00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:40,240
created that's my interpretation

00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:47,299
I read Lewis's feedback differently that

00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:49,549
like there's not a refresh that's needed

00:55:47,299 --> 00:55:51,740
but like fine like resurfacing these

00:55:49,549 --> 00:55:54,890
resources maybe maybe what's better I

00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:56,390
don't use your time time you spawn do

00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:59,619
maybe like quick readouts everyone just

00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:59,619
like kind of goes through their feedback

00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:05,760
[Music]

00:56:15,339 --> 00:56:20,210
so the first thing which we already

00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:22,609
started discussion on was like speaker

00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:26,480
selection which and the feedback here

00:56:22,609 --> 00:56:30,589
from Lewis and pooja was like first what

00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:32,960
is the speaker training exactly and like

00:56:30,589 --> 00:56:35,240
do you offer templates for presentation

00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:37,160
or do you do sessions like how do you do

00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:41,990
it and Justin was saying that you

00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:50,200
collaborate with mine share another

00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:50,200
feedback here goes that like when yeah

00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:58,130
just could you could you take actions

00:56:54,970 --> 00:57:00,049
for the things that could be doable

00:56:58,130 --> 00:57:02,930
because for example I can take care of

00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:05,690
just doing an unified rep of designs and

00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:12,039
so for conferences that would be easy to

00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:21,220
open so we have actions for after this

00:57:12,039 --> 00:57:24,410
if you if you have template training

00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:28,339
much this this complete this is a

00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:31,309
one-hour COC training offer template is

00:57:28,339 --> 00:57:33,559
a one-line so we want to provide them

00:57:31,309 --> 00:57:35,390
CEOs like introduce them to what is our

00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:38,779
code of conduct for fedora we want to

00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:41,869
offer them templates if you complete

00:57:38,779 --> 00:57:44,960
these three lines you come you covered

00:57:41,869 --> 00:57:45,980
the COC board because okay you are on

00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:50,090
the lines you are

00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:54,050
completely compliance the guideline yeah

00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:58,550
and COC you need core offer templates

00:57:54,050 --> 00:58:04,670
training example illustrations like what

00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:08,540
shoes for like and what is offer stylish

00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:12,560
I see one life offer scholarship

00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:13,730
scholarship is the last scholarships is

00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:19,670
in 2011

00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:22,430
I remember for Itamar Itamar so we can

00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:24,830
just say that at flock we are also we

00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:27,050
have the diversity ground and like for

00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:30,109
people to come here and for smaller

00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:32,660
events I we can think about if we want

00:58:30,109 --> 00:58:34,550
to find them like but I but I think we

00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:36,290
find organizers we don't find attendees

00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:38,300
to travel so I don't think like this

00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:41,240
will be relevant for federal community I

00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:42,710
will just remove that line I will keep

00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:46,670
it I will remove the line from the dock

00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:58,550
and the feedback here is keep and kill

00:58:46,670 --> 00:59:02,950
maintain this is my okay now we have

00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:06,550
poojas feedback on speaker selection

00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:06,550
okay thank you

00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:25,730
would I invite you to speaker I have

00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:27,890
okay like we need to keep and maintain

00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:30,350
the list of possible speakers but how

00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:32,810
like we if you are organizing our event

00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:34,040
locally we don't have like the list like

00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:36,260
how we can approach with other

00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:38,450
organization or other like we have the

00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:41,150
local speakers but how to contact with

00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:46,520
other speakers is there any like

00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:48,710
platform where we can maybe we can do

00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:51,080
you are you saying that we provide links

00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:53,990
to nearby organizations like pi ladies

00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:55,700
or something like how we can connect you

00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:58,640
are they how there should be some

00:59:55,700 --> 01:00:00,590
harlech guidelines or some like platform

00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:05,000
you know like a template message which

01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:07,550
you can use to send do my ladies contact

01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,770
contacts yeah like you know for some

01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:11,510
lack context an empty region sometime we

01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:18,380
may not know like what are the other

01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:19,790
communities because sometimes we do we

01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,800
are like out of throat legs from BIA

01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:24,320
whom we should contact we don't have the

01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:26,180
speaker for the event every time the

01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:28,160
same speakers are there so to have the

01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:30,260
diversity or and to have the new

01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:32,530
speakers we should have something like

01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,530
that

01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:48,620
and for selecting speaker there was a

01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:51,080
consider colorblindness in slide design

01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:53,480
considered colorblindness in the slide

01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:59,810
design so I didn't get this like how the

01:00:53,480 --> 01:01:02,690
speaker will so usually to but generally

01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:04,760
people are like red-green color blind so

01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:09,890
then if you put some visualization which

01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:18,080
only has red so it's better to use

01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:20,930
colors like so like that so we can do it

01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:26,570
in the templates and I have just the

01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:27,680
training thank you thanks a lot for the

01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:33,640
feedback

01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:39,410
so next section we move on to Yona four

01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:44,720
one two so I'm just once again pujan can

01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:47,170
you name the notes okay so your honor

01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:55,120
section is on code of conduct and

01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:55,120
organizing and her feedback is like yeah

01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:08,480
no I have also written a document so

01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:09,940
basically like in general what is

01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:14,090
written

01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:16,970
yeah like is it's a very nice guide but

01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:19,430
it not really applies to fedora and

01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:22,730
especially keeping in mind that usually

01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:25,700
the organizing teams are very small so

01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:27,830
like having one person taking care of

01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:30,440
all this I feel it's too much

01:02:27,830 --> 01:02:34,760
maybe the DNI can help with some stuff

01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:40,180
but otherwise I think like it's putting

01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:43,010
them more work so like I said before

01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:46,490
everything has to be implemented by

01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:48,920
everyone so some some like suggestions

01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:51,620
are for like release parties but some

01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:53,300
are also a well only to flow yeah but I

01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:55,580
am saying that this applies even to

01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:59,030
flock I would say because it's not that

01:02:55,580 --> 01:03:02,090
many people that are part of the team I

01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:14,000
think then in the organizing which I

01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:16,820
really liked was to have like a I would

01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:19,520
say for example in that case would be

01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:24,170
great someone for example from our team

01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:26,090
to be kind of responsible and we keep in

01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:27,710
contact with them like keep in touch

01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:29,540
with them and tell them hey we would

01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:31,820
like to have these things that flock can

01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:34,340
we make sure this happened yes this like

01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:36,260
would be great for flock and maybe you

01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:38,300
apply the same even like for small

01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:40,250
smaller events but having something from

01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:42,380
their team to do this I think would be

01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:46,150
too much even if we have these things

01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:48,590
maybe I don't know written somewhere

01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:51,410
maybe a suggested action item from that

01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:53,180
we already have this flock CFP committee

01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:54,980
and the organizing committee and they do

01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:56,720
pull people from the community to

01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:58,670
already be on those teams but that how

01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:01,460
that's chosen is not clear we could

01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:02,960
deliver that feedback to try to make

01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:05,300
sure that a diversity perspective is

01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,860
included in the CFP a committee and like

01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:10,030
the existing teams that they the

01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:10,030
existing committees

01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:17,579
like yeah like I'd say just like I what

01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:21,060
I would say from this that would apply

01:04:17,579 --> 01:04:23,010
for our events not only flog even

01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:26,520
smaller ones is to have someone from the

01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:28,890
DNI speaking with the organizers

01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:33,990
especially I would say for flock because

01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:36,440
small ones the organizing team is even

01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:39,210
smaller but for flock having someone was

01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:42,210
responsible or someone that wants to

01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:45,150
take care of this and just like speaking

01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:47,910
with organizing team would be the best

01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:49,170
approach so we talk with the organizing

01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:50,940
committee give them a list of

01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:53,640
recommendations which we want to see for

01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:57,960
next year yes we keep in touch with them

01:04:53,640 --> 01:05:01,220
to see that they implement yeah yes so

01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:06,869
that's what I have from the organizing

01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:10,589
so for COC I have made some comments

01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:12,810
directly at the document mostly it's

01:05:10,589 --> 01:05:14,940
just to be honest just like the the way

01:05:12,810 --> 01:05:16,109
how they are meetings I don't think it's

01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:18,619
like very important like the

01:05:16,109 --> 01:05:20,010
registration which like should be

01:05:18,619 --> 01:05:23,040
registration form

01:05:20,010 --> 01:05:24,119
I guess because or it's because in the

01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:27,270
beginning I read it like the

01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:29,790
registration desk which I think is the

01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:32,250
registration form the second one is

01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:34,829
include a copy of the COC in the sponsor

01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:37,140
packet not sure what it means we can

01:05:34,829 --> 01:05:52,109
just like put a link to COC here on the

01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:55,970
badge well it is I think okay this is

01:05:52,109 --> 01:05:55,970
not written so maybe we should add this

01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,400
but sponsor packet I don't know what

01:05:58,619 --> 01:06:04,310
that means

01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:08,359
yeah so these guidelines

01:06:04,310 --> 01:06:10,310
devised version but it can be like the

01:06:08,359 --> 01:06:13,849
sponsorship prospectus probably and I

01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:15,800
think this can apply for even flock or

01:06:13,849 --> 01:06:21,710
small events when they want to partner

01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:27,770
with some other sponsors another okay

01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:29,869
and the other thing is that it's not

01:06:27,770 --> 01:06:32,000
very clear the last part when where it

01:06:29,869 --> 01:06:35,210
says like maybe make it clear what the

01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:38,450
consequences or resolutions of a

01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:41,150
violation are consider a visual workflow

01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:43,730
of code of contact violation so this

01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:46,550
needs to have more support from us

01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:49,430
something that can be done from the DNI

01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:51,680
team or someone that knows how to do it

01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:53,750
and just give them ready so they can

01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:56,030
have it at their event otherwise just

01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:59,210
reading like it is it's not clear would

01:06:56,030 --> 01:07:19,010
be way more work for them so that would

01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:20,330
make it more complicated yes so I was

01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:22,670
going through the venue selection

01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:27,349
feedback and I came up with one two

01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:29,270
three four five just five so I look at

01:07:27,349 --> 01:07:32,810
some specific things they were talked

01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:33,680
about ASL and captioning remote and

01:07:32,810 --> 01:07:35,510
remote access

01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:37,460
I thought captioning could be one

01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:39,830
investment from the DNI team for the

01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:44,630
flock video budget and also thinking of

01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:46,369
ASL captioning getting there so I think

01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:48,770
because later in the document it talks

01:07:46,369 --> 01:07:53,540
about ASL and captioning as an option

01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:55,550
for event talks and I thought maybe live

01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:58,550
captioning could be better than ASL as a

01:07:55,550 --> 01:08:01,940
way to start making this a part of the

01:07:58,550 --> 01:08:03,260
and this is missus flock specific as I

01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:05,300
know there's multiple sign languages

01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:06,740
it's not like ASL is really big in the

01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:08,690
US because it's American sign language

01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:10,580
but that's not consistent around the

01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:12,680
rest of the world and I also feel like

01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:14,420
with live captioning even non deaf

01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:16,850
hard-of-hearing people can also benefit

01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:17,900
from that so it might be an easier like

01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:21,440
you know like it be it

01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:22,730
after I get my you know if you have like

01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:30,620
that I can interpret our live

01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:32,540
interpreter and there's no one I like

01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:35,090
because I know this is a very

01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:36,890
contentious topic in the ASL or in the

01:08:35,090 --> 01:08:39,050
deaf hard-of-hearing community I'd like

01:08:36,890 --> 01:08:44,270
to get external feedback on that I think

01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:47,150
we need to like reach out I can't take

01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:49,730
that action item gender-neutral

01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:51,230
bathrooms in the dock it was a green

01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:55,820
checkmark but I think that could

01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:57,590
actually be an Apple for tampons and

01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:59,600
pads I thought that could be required

01:08:57,590 --> 01:09:02,000
for large events like flock and it

01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:04,760
mentioned doing it in both like both

01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,200
gender restrooms as well and then there

01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:09,610
was another part about no standing zone

01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:11,960
so this is something for when you have

01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:13,490
like in out in the hallways there would

01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:16,250
be like a taped off area that's

01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:17,600
explicitly like taped or tape the side

01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:19,100
so like someone with a wheelchair it'll

01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,750
always be free of people so someone with

01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:22,760
a wheelchair can get through a narrow

01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:24,650
hallway so people don't you know spread

01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:26,450
out in the hallway and I felt like

01:09:24,650 --> 01:09:28,190
that's easy enough to do like you just

01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:29,450
have to set tape in a hallway and like I

01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:31,250
know like and that's I mean it's easier

01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:33,530
for us to see because we have people in

01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:35,630
our community who are in wheelchairs too

01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:38,360
so I mean those are just five takeaways

01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:40,930
that I looked at some things that I okay

01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:40,930
I thought about

01:09:54,970 --> 01:10:01,880
okay so first first point was in the

01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:06,740
event registration it was regarding the

01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:10,130
what to ask and what do not maybe we

01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:11,900
should be specific here maybe collecting

01:10:10,130 --> 01:10:16,370
we are collecting the data from the

01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:22,460
users right so there are some policies

01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:24,140
in so there is this thing and I think we

01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:30,650
need to talk more if we are going to go

01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:32,120
back for a feedback survey after so we

01:10:30,650 --> 01:10:35,390
need to figure out the legal issues of

01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:38,240
that but apart from that what is that

01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:40,220
was the point and I guess we need to

01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:44,510
mention it somewhere or put it actual

01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:46,520
action item so for the people who joined

01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:50,120
recently we are working on a proposal

01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:52,460
for event guidelines to make our events

01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:54,380
more diverse and inclusive these are the

01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:56,870
areas we are covering we just did a

01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:58,580
quick review through the proposal and

01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:59,540
this is this is the feedback and

01:10:58,580 --> 01:11:02,060
everybody is going through their

01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:07,100
feedback like would based on the draft a

01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:09,410
meeting you know so for the childcare

01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:11,780
facilities the first point of course is

01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:15,350
the budget and we need to figure that

01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:17,510
out and then second even before the

01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:19,700
budget we would like to take the

01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:21,830
feedback from the people who are like

01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:24,200
the contributors and everybody the

01:11:21,830 --> 01:11:27,410
attendance of these events that would

01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:30,230
they like to take this facility or not

01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:33,470
would they actually be you know

01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:35,150
utilizing this facility and the second

01:11:33,470 --> 01:11:40,790
thing is or they would like to take a

01:11:35,150 --> 01:11:46,410
break from yeah

01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:49,560
exactly so and this second thing is will

01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:57,180
not having children around detectors

01:11:49,560 --> 01:12:00,690
from the work in evangelization second

01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:03,990
part was or t-shirts regarding the sizes

01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:06,450
there should be some standards as us

01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:26,790
sizes and some of the other countries

01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:30,830
sizes are different so maybe 32 maybe

01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:34,470
that point we can add it in here and

01:12:30,830 --> 01:12:41,550
regarding the last one that was related

01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:43,680
to the photo policy here you have

01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:45,330
included if you will have photographer

01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:48,000
at the event include information for

01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:50,490
attendees explaining that they may be

01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,590
photographs or not and how to offer

01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:55,290
opt-out them for the from the

01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:58,170
registration so uh so what is the

01:12:55,290 --> 01:13:07,980
implementation part for this already

01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:10,520
that you I think like for this block

01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:10,520
they have

01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:23,279
[Music]

01:13:44,500 --> 01:14:01,670
even if I'm just going to go through my

01:13:58,430 --> 01:14:07,340
feedback first because we are almost out

01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:11,060
of time so I so my feedback was mainly

01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:13,700
for like for the assessment part suppose

01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:16,850
if we decide to do a survey if it goes

01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:18,830
if we talk to legal and they say it's ok

01:14:16,850 --> 01:14:20,270
to go through like a survey which

01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:22,790
doesn't collect any demographic

01:14:20,270 --> 01:14:24,440
information or like organizers can

01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:26,510
themself ask through Eventbrite

01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:28,160
registration or something then for that

01:14:26,510 --> 01:14:31,160
survey maybe we need to provide like an

01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:32,870
assessment template to the organizer so

01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:35,120
that it is not like an additional world

01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:36,800
so we can have a small template and they

01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,160
can just use that template to collect

01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,600
feedback

01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:42,170
so that was my feedback on the

01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:44,510
assessment part and and for me the grant

01:14:42,170 --> 01:14:46,760
thing like donations were a good

01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:50,000
suggestion and I think we can do that it

01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:52,490
has like high impact and high effort so

01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,950
basically the idea was that for grants

01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:57,020
people can donate like we already do it

01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:59,390
flock so you can cover somebody's budget

01:14:57,020 --> 01:15:01,440
and so we are we are already doing that

01:14:59,390 --> 01:15:02,550
so I just like

01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:05,610
I think that was to put a green

01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:11,760
checkmark and for xavius feedback I

01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:13,469
think the feedback is like so his field

01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:16,370
like is open everything is pretty

01:15:13,469 --> 01:15:16,370
twisted here

01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:25,690
yeah

01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:40,190
so we are out of time so I think we

01:15:38,449 --> 01:15:41,749
should move on to next I will write down

01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:45,400
this feedback in the doc and we can

01:15:41,749 --> 01:15:45,400
rehydrate over the actionable item

01:16:02,409 --> 01:16:10,090
let's see what we have next

01:16:05,409 --> 01:16:12,010
kuduro mint state how much time 25

01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:43,239
minutes - everyone - somebody would like

01:16:12,010 --> 01:16:45,280
to come here and okay

01:16:43,239 --> 01:16:47,530
so the translation one the important

01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:53,050
content translation that's what you

01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:55,179
wanna cover that is okay so since we

01:16:53,050 --> 01:16:58,030
have the people from the translation

01:16:55,179 --> 01:17:01,539
team we would like to cover this ticket

01:16:58,030 --> 01:17:05,650
which we have opened few days back there

01:17:01,539 --> 01:17:07,449
was a comment on Matthew Miller's new

01:17:05,650 --> 01:17:11,499
strategy for fedora and the goals for

01:17:07,449 --> 01:17:14,439
Fedora poor article that the English

01:17:11,499 --> 01:17:16,659
returned over there is too complicated

01:17:14,439 --> 01:17:20,079
to understand for that person even if we

01:17:16,659 --> 01:17:23,229
understand that English so we wanted the

01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:24,760
diversity team want that these messages

01:17:23,229 --> 01:17:26,709
which are very critical for the

01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:29,800
community should reach out to more and

01:17:26,709 --> 01:17:32,469
more people and at least these important

01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:35,679
messages should be translated in the all

01:17:32,469 --> 01:17:38,650
possible languages from where our

01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:43,869
contributors are so that is what the

01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:45,519
topic was and maybe I think to add some

01:17:43,869 --> 01:17:48,099
context just to try to draw it really

01:17:45,519 --> 01:17:50,499
focuses conversation we realize that

01:17:48,099 --> 01:17:52,510
there's some things that may have like a

01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:54,760
really high impact value on the

01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:56,769
translation side but one of the things

01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:59,229
that's confusing for us is we don't we

01:17:56,769 --> 01:18:00,449
want to work better with the

01:17:59,229 --> 01:18:02,559
localization and internationalization

01:18:00,449 --> 01:18:04,809
teams and we want to find more ways that

01:18:02,559 --> 01:18:06,909
we as the diversity and inclusion team

01:18:04,809 --> 01:18:09,400
can collaborate better and have like

01:18:06,909 --> 01:18:11,139
because we don't want to do all the I

01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:12,400
realize we want to take on the work of

01:18:11,139 --> 01:18:14,349
the translations because that's what's

01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,519
already being done in the community so

01:18:14,349 --> 01:18:17,160
we want to find ways to better

01:18:15,519 --> 01:18:20,520
collaborate and kind of

01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:36,510
work together on these things I can pass

01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:39,540
them I do okay works so um there's two

01:18:36,510 --> 01:18:41,160
things the first one is the source

01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:43,110
longer just being too difficult to

01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:48,020
understand we cannot do anything this is

01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:52,260
the this is the writer who have to

01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:55,140
improve this and it's also an issue that

01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:57,360
we have we as translator to have some

01:18:55,140 --> 01:19:01,620
strings that are too technical law using

01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:03,900
a lot of French the name is jargon which

01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:06,660
is you use some technical words that you

01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:08,370
use up legs with the human people

01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:11,790
outside of this world not understand

01:19:08,370 --> 01:19:16,700
anything so this part we cannot do much

01:19:11,790 --> 01:19:20,430
but what we can do for for allowing to

01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:22,470
to translate announcement is you can do

01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:27,180
the new translation system of

01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:31,290
documentation and this is ready already

01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:34,910
I Adam and I we did the walk together so

01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:40,800
any any Content you will publish on the

01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:46,740
documentation diversity parts will be

01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:49,350
translatable in any kind of languages so

01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:51,780
maybe one way we can start collaborating

01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:54,960
better is when we see a que a high

01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:56,790
priority like item or something like you

01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:57,960
know they like the mission like the

01:19:56,790 --> 01:20:00,480
revision of the mission statement

01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:02,460
articles one way we could work with the

01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:04,290
maybe the fedora council is incorporate

01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:05,850
this feedback loop for them where they

01:20:04,290 --> 01:20:09,840
will go to a document like one of the

01:20:05,850 --> 01:20:12,450
Fedora Docs repositories and open an

01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:15,990
issue open a pull request with the

01:20:12,450 --> 01:20:17,190
source in like asciidoc and would that

01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:19,100
make it like what would make it easy

01:20:17,190 --> 01:20:21,030
what would make it easy for the

01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:23,220
internationalization team to take this

01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:25,290
content and translate it like what's the

01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:30,550
best approach that you that you think

01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:33,070
would be first of all we need no issue

01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:35,170
things like that no no on Pedro we need

01:20:33,070 --> 01:20:38,530
more emails on the international

01:20:35,170 --> 01:20:40,450
translation mailing list containing what

01:20:38,530 --> 01:20:44,800
is to translate what to translate and

01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:46,270
what's the publishing process so way to

01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,420
translate and what's the publishing

01:20:46,270 --> 01:20:52,210
process is can be solved if you use the

01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:55,300
token documentation translation system

01:20:52,210 --> 01:20:58,390
so you just have to send us an email we

01:20:55,300 --> 01:21:01,390
discussed with the conceal and our group

01:20:58,390 --> 01:21:03,250
we this page is very important for us to

01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:06,400
be translated can you please go

01:21:03,250 --> 01:21:09,070
translate it and and you give the link

01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:10,990
and we will do it but there is nothing

01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:14,410
really formal for now in their

01:21:10,990 --> 01:21:18,790
localization community we need to set up

01:21:14,410 --> 01:21:20,050
every new process so it's probably the

01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:21,910
best way to start driving the

01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:23,170
conversation is to better engage with

01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:25,750
like the mailing list since it seems

01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:28,600
like that's where most of the it's it's

01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:32,710
really what what is this will be

01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:35,800
mandatory yes it's the first step is to

01:21:32,710 --> 01:21:37,510
publish the internalization and the

01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:41,890
recognised content of the of our

01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:45,280
documentation system and this is will be

01:21:41,890 --> 01:21:47,200
done once we have a Webley translation

01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:49,540
platform in cell for the federal

01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:52,750
community which will be in the coming

01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:54,970
month before December for sure but in

01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:57,790
the coming month so once we have this

01:21:54,970 --> 01:22:00,190
life and walking then you can come and

01:21:57,790 --> 01:22:01,180
say this is we think this is very

01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:03,820
important for the international

01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:05,710
community to know and you will share the

01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:10,540
link and we will do our best to

01:22:05,710 --> 01:22:12,430
translate it and maybe just one more one

01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:14,800
more idea of one way we could do this is

01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:17,200
what if we I'm just curious if you think

01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:18,670
this would be helpful or not but working

01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:21,640
with the fedora council for them to

01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:23,320
create a dr. posit ori in their workflow

01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:24,790
and when they want to publish an

01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:26,410
announcement so that would be on the

01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:28,930
fedora magazine they might push the

01:22:26,410 --> 01:22:30,550
content into that Doc's repo as well and

01:22:28,930 --> 01:22:33,280
will be a special ike a specific

01:22:30,550 --> 01:22:35,800
repository for those announcements so

01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:38,410
you want to publish them some localized

01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:40,690
announcements and the federal magazines

01:22:38,410 --> 01:22:42,370
the ones that i say like further it

01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:43,900
wasn't all magazine articles but in this

01:22:42,370 --> 01:22:45,520
case it was like the mission

01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:47,050
mission the change of the mission

01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:50,710
statement and things and have a very

01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:52,420
like have very difficult to understand

01:22:50,710 --> 01:22:54,580
language for non-english speakers and

01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:56,199
might be harder to interpret so I think

01:22:54,580 --> 01:22:58,960
maybe like the first thing I'm hearing

01:22:56,199 --> 01:23:00,340
from you is one we need to engage better

01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:01,600
with the mailing list because that's

01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:04,540
where most of the internationalization

01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,920
community is exact and then to this is

01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:07,270
just me trying out an idea because I'm

01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:09,699
thinking like how can we get the fedora

01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:11,530
council to also buy in on this and how

01:23:09,699 --> 01:23:13,570
can we make it easy for localization and

01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:16,330
how can we make it easy for the fedora

01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:19,840
council to help you guys out with this -

01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:21,850
the challenge is the tooling we have an

01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:25,090
answer for the documentation that will

01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:27,640
come but we have no nothing for the

01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:30,370
community blog or the federal magazine

01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:33,190
for now it's part of the thing that we

01:23:30,370 --> 01:23:35,679
should address but for now we have no

01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:37,870
solution to publish on the federal

01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:40,420
magazine in multiple languages some

01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:43,719
community will love to do it but for the

01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:47,590
moment we're using WordPress and I'm not

01:23:43,719 --> 01:23:50,380
sure we have appropriate tooling in what

01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:54,070
ways to support our translation team so

01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:56,290
I mean like a initial thing we could do

01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:58,840
here to support different languages is

01:23:56,290 --> 01:24:02,440
that we just add links to the translated

01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:05,050
text in the original article published

01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:08,650
on say community block yes so we can do

01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:12,250
that for now you will be able to do it

01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:13,659
in a few months but not today today if

01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:16,030
you want to publish something in

01:24:13,659 --> 01:24:22,090
multiple language I just invite you to

01:24:16,030 --> 01:24:25,810
find a trick with the WordPress system

01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:28,739
to just display to make something with

01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:32,650
tabs and stuff but it will be a

01:24:28,739 --> 01:24:34,239
do-it-yourself solution like so I think

01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:35,560
since this is on the roadmap that seemed

01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:38,949
like this could be one way to do it

01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:41,620
since the darks localization is the only

01:24:38,949 --> 01:24:45,659
serious way to do it in the close future

01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:47,980
and we will love I think the the

01:24:45,659 --> 01:24:49,780
localization community would be enough

01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:52,210
to be able to publish some content on

01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:55,570
the website in their own language but

01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:56,949
for now there is no process for that and

01:24:55,570 --> 01:25:04,630
there is no tuning for that this

01:24:56,949 --> 01:25:06,729
the biggest problem okay for the Fedora

01:25:04,630 --> 01:25:09,099
magazine in the community blog I think

01:25:06,729 --> 01:25:11,590
for those workflows those aren't we have

01:25:09,099 --> 01:25:13,179
a lot of people who write articles with

01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:15,489
like the web interface and aren't really

01:25:13,179 --> 01:25:17,079
familiar with like it or there might be

01:25:15,489 --> 01:25:19,300
like first-time contributors I think

01:25:17,079 --> 01:25:21,670
it'd be really difficult to move outside

01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:24,340
of those those workflows for those teams

01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:26,289
so we're trying to find like the two

01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:29,349
kind of things I'm reading from this to

01:25:26,289 --> 01:25:31,659
take away are like one coming up with a

01:25:29,349 --> 01:25:33,369
better way for the DNI team and maybe

01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:35,050
the council as well to engage on the

01:25:33,369 --> 01:25:37,179
internationalization mailing lists and

01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:38,739
maybe as a workaround since we've we

01:25:37,179 --> 01:25:40,389
faced this issue even since like for

01:25:38,739 --> 01:25:42,519
four years I've I've seen the same

01:25:40,389 --> 01:25:44,800
conversation about the WordPress sites

01:25:42,519 --> 01:25:46,929
being difficult to translate so maybe

01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:49,929
now that we finally have this Doc's

01:25:46,929 --> 01:25:51,579
localization piece coming in and that's

01:25:49,929 --> 01:25:53,709
what we're already encouraging people to

01:25:51,579 --> 01:25:55,749
you will will use to do the

01:25:53,709 --> 01:25:57,159
internationalization so people will

01:25:55,749 --> 01:25:59,320
hopefully be comfortable with that

01:25:57,159 --> 01:26:01,420
already that could be a way that we

01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:04,719
could work around the pains of you know

01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:06,070
of the WordPress translation and we can

01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:07,900
try to focus on when there's really

01:26:06,070 --> 01:26:10,179
important things that the fedora council

01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:12,670
or someone is trying to push out to

01:26:10,179 --> 01:26:15,059
engage with that localization process

01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:18,579
for these articles before publishing

01:26:15,059 --> 01:26:22,449
does those two things sound like a fare

01:26:18,579 --> 01:26:25,599
to be efficient and to be to be able to

01:26:22,449 --> 01:26:29,110
scale like integrating multiple teams

01:26:25,599 --> 01:26:33,519
even if they are little is we need to

01:26:29,110 --> 01:26:35,429
always use the translation platform to

01:26:33,519 --> 01:26:39,329
use the translation platform means

01:26:35,429 --> 01:26:42,459
having a set of tools to generate

01:26:39,329 --> 01:26:45,249
content from English to translation for

01:26:42,459 --> 01:26:50,860
translation for them to look at its

01:26:45,249 --> 01:26:52,840
content and this is the way to be very

01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:56,199
efficient with the translator community

01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:59,229
if if you want from times to times you

01:26:56,199 --> 01:27:01,690
can totally send a text message to the

01:26:59,229 --> 01:27:04,030
translation mailing list saying please

01:27:01,690 --> 01:27:07,539
send us back this internalization of

01:27:04,030 --> 01:27:09,170
this text for this deadline make it

01:27:07,539 --> 01:27:13,100
reasonable so we have

01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:16,190
then you know what is translating this

01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:18,440
can walk for one or two times but it

01:27:16,190 --> 01:27:21,170
will never scale our business the number

01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:23,330
of the time so if we correct like you

01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:26,270
want to publish an article next week or

01:27:23,330 --> 01:27:28,910
next month I don't know and you want to

01:27:26,270 --> 01:27:31,670
translate our community to contribute

01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:34,219
this you create page of repository you

01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:36,469
put your content and you say you send an

01:27:34,219 --> 01:27:38,270
email say this is the content this is

01:27:36,469 --> 01:27:40,880
the deadline to publish the content

01:27:38,270 --> 01:27:44,060
either open a pull request upon an issue

01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:48,590
or send an email to that e that that

01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:52,940
email address and we can do that but I

01:27:48,590 --> 01:27:56,480
think the best is to first focus on the

01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:57,800
documentation system we use because I

01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:00,199
think it would be way easier for

01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:03,350
everyone you will be able to travel

01:28:00,199 --> 01:28:06,080
flowing you your reason and we will have

01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:08,870
orbit rules and our publishing system to

01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:13,130
do it automatically it will be way more

01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:16,100
smooth and for now I think the subject

01:28:13,130 --> 01:28:18,500
about localization of the federal

01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:20,780
magazine or federal community blog I

01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:24,560
think we are quite far from being able

01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:27,260
to do that so we just I think just using

01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:28,760
some tricks with the WordPress - once in

01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:32,540
a while publishing localized content

01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:37,820
will do it for now but it's my personal

01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:38,929
opinion and so just so I want to make

01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:40,580
sure we have time to cover the last

01:28:38,929 --> 01:28:42,230
topic for our session and make the group

01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:44,179
photo I'm going to say so here's what

01:28:42,230 --> 01:28:46,100
I'm going to do I'm gonna go into the

01:28:44,179 --> 01:28:49,340
the DNI team ticket and summarize about

01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:51,020
this discussion and I want to move this

01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:53,719
conversation to the council as well

01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:55,520
about how we can engage with them for

01:28:53,719 --> 01:28:57,290
content that they feel is important how

01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:59,989
we can have that relationship with the

01:28:57,290 --> 01:29:02,090
internationalisation team so that's what

01:28:59,989 --> 01:29:04,699
I'll do in the next 20 minutes here

01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:07,100
figure to drive this conversation to the

01:29:04,699 --> 01:29:10,239
other side of the session information as

01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:12,739
diversity teams with this morning about

01:29:10,239 --> 01:29:16,400
federal organization objectives we could

01:29:12,739 --> 01:29:19,750
have the first one is to help local

01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:19,750
communities to

01:29:19,910 --> 01:29:24,650
with providing some tools for them to

01:29:22,670 --> 01:29:26,630
discuss in their own knowledge and to

01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:29,360
exist in their own knowledge and the

01:29:26,630 --> 01:29:31,340
second one is to provide some tools for

01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:34,520
the translator community to help them

01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:37,280
being more efficient globally speaking

01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:38,660
in terms of translation so we will

01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:40,990
probably discuss the first point

01:29:38,660 --> 01:29:43,040
together because it's a huge subject

01:29:40,990 --> 01:29:44,390
excellent I'll tell you in the comment

01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,350
or in the ticket comment as well and we

01:29:44,390 --> 01:29:47,630
can follow up there

01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:49,670
very good thanks thanks for all the

01:29:47,630 --> 01:29:51,530
localization folks who came by do you

01:29:49,670 --> 01:29:54,490
have anything to add this is it good

01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:54,490
perfect

01:30:18,050 --> 01:30:23,820
so when one asked over here for the

01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:25,920
federal woman say is to ask more and

01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:29,100
more people to submit the proposal and

01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:31,050
it is for all of you that we got a ping

01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:34,730
more people to submit their proposals

01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:37,500
before the deadline okay and I will

01:30:34,730 --> 01:30:42,360
quickly move on to the team processes

01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:44,790
now I would like to brief about the DI

01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:47,640
council representative elections and

01:30:44,790 --> 01:30:51,090
what are the things which we need to

01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:53,250
cover in that I had a brief discussion

01:30:51,090 --> 01:30:54,930
with Ben cotton this morning about the

01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:58,080
election process which we need to follow

01:30:54,930 --> 01:31:01,410
and what data he needs so we need to

01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:03,540
open for open up the elections for the

01:31:01,410 --> 01:31:07,860
nominations first we need to decide on

01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:09,989
how much time duration this nomination

01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:11,719
will be open the nomination window and

01:31:09,989 --> 01:31:14,850
then we need to interview these

01:31:11,719 --> 01:31:16,800
nominated people for the position and

01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:19,290
then we need to open it up for the

01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:21,140
footing process so we first thing which

01:31:19,290 --> 01:31:24,030
we need to decide is on the time frame

01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:26,550
when we would like to do it and for how

01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:28,680
long we need to open these windows for

01:31:26,550 --> 01:31:31,350
the nominations for the interview and

01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:33,239
for the voting process and then the most

01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:35,630
critical part is the eligibility for the

01:31:33,239 --> 01:31:35,630
