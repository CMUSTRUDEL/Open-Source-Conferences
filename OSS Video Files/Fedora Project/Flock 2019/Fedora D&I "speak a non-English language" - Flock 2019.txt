Title: Fedora D&I "speak a non-English language" - Flock 2019
Publication date: 2019-10-15
Playlist: Flock 2019
Description: 
	Maria Leandro, Bhagyashree Padalka, Jona Azizaj, Luis Enrique Bazán De León

This is a two-part evening activity proposal. One evening of Flock, we will gather together and plan a conversation. Each part of the conversation will be spoken in a different language. The languages we choose will be from what languages are spoken by whoever participates. On the last day of Flock during the wrap-up session, we would present the multi-lingual conversation to the rest of Flock.
