Description: 
	If you are repository maintainer and if you like automatization and making your life easier you can be also interested in release-bot. Release-bot helps upstream maintainers deliver their software to users, via automated releases at GitHub and PyPI. Just create an issue in your repository and bot will make its job and create a new release on PyPi/Github/Pagure in a minute. In this short 25 min talk, we will look at release-bot closer. Show how we can configure it and what is the release-bot future.
