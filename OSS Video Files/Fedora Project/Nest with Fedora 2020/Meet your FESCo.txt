	00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,879
uh when we get things started by just

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,839
doing kind of a round table here um

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,280
we've got

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,040
i i assume we're going to have people

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,960
come in and out

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,880
and we can just do kind of a quick

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,600
introduction for those of you

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,640
know who we are uh and then take

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,039
questions from that

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,880
uh unless anyone has i don't know like

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,920
an agenda or something i don't think we

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,560
really have that

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,880
do we have an agenda is that a thing i i

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,400
don't think so yeah

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,920
like i don't actually know what we're

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,360
supposed to do

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,960
yeah so okay uh all right so if you've

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,320
been to a flock or even

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,719
a fud con there was always a session

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,440
where

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,879
you would get to talk to fazco members

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,120
and which is sort of an open q

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,000
a but also an opportunity to meet them

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,760
in person

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,760
uh this is the best we can do in these

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,239
times since it's a virtual event i guess

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,920
so

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,280
um yeah that uh given the time zones and

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,239
constraints

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,039
of everything this is uh five of us who

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,960
are here

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,479

linux user and developer since the

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,960
mid-90s

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,880
many changes uh throughout history many

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,479
distributions have come and gone

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:30,400
many technologies

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,040
now i'm here uh elected to tesco and

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,320
hopefully

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,360
hopefully uh doing some good uh so

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,479
i will pass it on over to

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,360
neil all right then so

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,520
my name is neil gampa i am actually kind

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,600
of new to this whole fasco thing like uh

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,360
uh but i have been around you know

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,479
around the block for a while i

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,079
i've been involved in fedora for

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,520
a little over 12 13 since 2007 i can't

00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,680
do math in my head right now

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,719
but i've been around since 2007 as a

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,360
contributor

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,520
um i've actually been a user of fedora

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,840
since it started as a project

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,759
um even before that with red hat linux

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,040
and stuff like that i've bounced around

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:16,160
using ubuntu uh gen2

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,520
that was um uh and and a few other

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,000
distributions here and there

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,000
uh and these days i'm involved you know

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,520
in fedora and maji open source and so

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,879
on for fresco stuff i i i guess today i

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,920
would be known as the

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:33,760
the one who has caused the most trouble

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,400
you know this cycle um both good and bad

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,480
hopefully mostly good but from some

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,840
people's perspective probably all bad

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,480
um so you know

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,519
my the thing i do is just i try to bring

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,120
a little bit of the

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,080
the world of linux perspective and also

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,239
tried to help bring

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,760
you know my expertise and a lot of the

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,879
plumbing layer stuff to

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,200
fesco um as well as a lot of the

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,400
packaging and things like that um so

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,319
i'll just kind of

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,720
throw my virtual baton to fabio

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,159
okay uh can anybody hear me i'm not sure

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,440
this microphone works

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,640
it works uh great um

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,920
all right i'm fabio and my nickname is

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,080
decathorp everywhere and not sure

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,599
anybody ever got that pun

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,239
uh but all right um i'm

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,239
mostly involved with packaging on fedora

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,680
and i've joined fesco

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,080
uh the cycle before this one

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,000
so my term is going to be up soon i

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,280
think

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,319
and i'm mostly involved with

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,599
some with maintaining the

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:48,720
pantheon desktop environment

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:52,159
a lot of java packages

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,720
so yeah um

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,799
and i've i think i've been packaging

00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,319
stuff for fedora

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,799
since 2015 or something like that

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,319
i made you do get into it with pantheon

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,720
yeah

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,159
i'm your fault neil it is my fault and

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,360
i'm okay with this

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,200
yeah it's okay it's not so bad i mean

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,079
pantheon desktop was probably better

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,199
than the java stack

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,639
yeah it's definitely less trouble

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:27,680
except when the gnome guys

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,680
are not helpful yeah well

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,880
yeah um well i think that's it for me

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,720
uh who should i pass the baton to

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,800
well you could throw it up to kevin or

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,199
throw it to the right to clement

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,280
uh okay kevin uh your turn

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,320
okay i i hope everyone can hear me my

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,639
mic is

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,759
being flaky and low but i'll try and

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,800
shout

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,639
um i'm kevin finzee nurik on irc i've

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,080
been involved in fedora since

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,960
uh 2005 i think it was when i started

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,160
taking over the

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,919
irc or the xfce packages from fedora

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,039
extras

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,120
so long long time ago i've been on fesco

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,880
for ages

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,960
i try and you know keep the historical

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,240
perspective around and

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,280
help folks where i where i can and um

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,280
yeah um

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,280
been really really really really busy

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,199
with the data center move lately and

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,360
things have been flaky in infrastructure

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,360
so i've been trying to calm that down

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,800
but hopefully we'll get to a nice place

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,039
here very soon and

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,240
and we can actually start getting more

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,400
more stuff done

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:41,600
so that's my hope so i will toss the

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,600
baton up to clemont

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,720

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,880
this year so

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,960

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,560
voice side of things also

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,600
and this is my first time in fiscal so

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,400
i've been

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,000
elected just for this cycle so i'm like

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,440
very new here

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,520

also

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,720
okay i've been watching the questions in

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,840
the in the chat here

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,360
and uh let's see the first one

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,600
that that when we started doing the

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,800
round table was uh they wanted neil to

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,759
explain

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,160
uh your irc knicks and how many you have

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,440
and

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,440
why you have so many

00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,360
[Music]

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,240
oh you're you're muted

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,919
it started with me having only one irc

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,599
nick i had conan

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,000
kudo which is the name i typically use

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,039
everywhere um

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,919
and i used to do this from a machine

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,199
that i had

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,000
rented from a friend that ran fedora

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,919
server on it

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,520
and i had earsy running on it and i

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:23,919
would just be in there for all

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:26,960
all the time um in 2015 that server

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,560
uh finally died like the hard

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,240
the hard drive just straight up failed

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,039
and it was not recoverable

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,160
and so i lost everything for that um at

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,840
the same time i

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,000
moved from where i used to live in

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,120
mississippi to connecticut

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,319
and then i lost access to a stable

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,879
computer

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,319
and so consequently i was always

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,240
juggling around

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,759
different devices but i needed some kind

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,039
of way to persistently keep track of

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,440
conversations

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,879
um but i didn't have a stable internet

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,000
connection anywhere so i couldn't run a

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,120
bouncer

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,639
so what wound up happening was that at

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,840
work i wound up having a computer that

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,360
was always running and i had a

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,000
connection in there and that was set up

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,240
with a

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,879
with an account that's faro attempt and

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,199
then on my laptop for a while i used sun

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,400
goku on my rc client there

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,960
and that was my macbook and then

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,520
um my phone used sir gallant mon for a

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,120
while

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,160
and then king inuyasha is my desktop

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,039
here

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,879
and then over and then i switched to

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,639
matrix a little while ago so i retired

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,960
using sun goku so much and i went to

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,519
eighth doctor which is my matrix client

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,039
and actually now you kind of get this

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,039
this is like all these different points

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,000
to interact with irc

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,959
is because i irc doesn't let me have one

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,399
persistent

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,480
thing that i can rotate the same

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,200
identity across computers

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,480
um however i've been generally happy

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,959
with matrix

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,560
and if i decide to go into setting up my

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,640
own matrix home server

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,320
i'll probably reconsolidate everything

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,120
again and go back to just using conan

00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,800
kudo everywhere

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,480
but that's sort of the story why i have

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,680
so many nicks um

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,200
also yeah and in some cases i wind up

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,920
having an alternate nick because some

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,600
networks

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,040
literally don't let me use my preferred

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,320
one like in

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,040
for example in um for a long time in

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,560
oftc

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,240
pharaoh 10 was actually reserved by

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,279
somebody else so i had to use a

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,720
different name

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:23,360
uh and a couple of other networks

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,399
uh had some of my other preferred nics

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,000
registered already

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,760
so i went up and used different names

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,360
there um

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,040
but yeah so that that's kind of the

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,720
story behind it's like for a year and a

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,160
half i lived as a nomad it didn't have a

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,600
persistent connection

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,279
and didn't have money to have a

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,680
persistence somewhere

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,279
so i wound up having to have multiple um

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,839
connections into irc

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,440
so that i could have you know the uh at

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,600
least the perception

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,560
of being always available in some form

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,360
or fashion

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,360
uh and it's sort of stuck i'm hoping

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,959
that eventually

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,040
as things get a little bit better i

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,920
still have to do like very expensive

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,800
housework

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,480
um that and once that's all done maybe

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,279
finally start fixing this and going back

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,120
to having

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,480
one nick again because like matrix has

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,240
actually worked out pretty well

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,560
it has a lot of the advantages of having

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,560
a bouncer while also giving me

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:18,720
um an actually decent experience

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,399
across um across jumping clients because

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,839
the one of the disadvantages i found

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,800
with having a bouncer when i used to do

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,720
that was

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,240
going to different computers and like

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,839
having to actually manually fetch the

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,279
logs rather than it just being

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,360
there for me to see so i could keep

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,680
track of my communications

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,880
so we'll see how that goes maybe i won't

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,079
be known as the guy with

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,920
six plus nicks eventually we'll see uh

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,640
but that that's the story behind it and

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,720
that's

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,880
you know and i think i have a list of

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,279
them my my list of them exists

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,800
on ironically my launchpad account but

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,079
once fast is replaced with the new

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,320
account system

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,880
they will also be there because they've

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:59,120
added the ability to store multiple nics

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,120
into fast so now that they will all work

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,560
so yeah that's the story

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,160
all right yeah that is that is

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,680
definitely

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:17,839
uh quite the irc history um

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:21,680
let's see uh as you were explaining that

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:25,200
um mostly it's people commenting on uh

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,640
on your irc mix um i'm looking back did

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,839
anyone see any questions

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,839
do we have any questions

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,240
it seems like someone's just placing

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,360
bets on which nick i will actually

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,600
whether or not i'll wind up with

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,040
multiple dicks even with matrix

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,640
i mean that's technically the current

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,160
situation but we'll see

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,320
i'd like to actually consolidate them

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,839
because having multiple knicks and

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,440
having multiple locations has some

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,639
really huge pitfalls

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,639
like i don't have i cannot maintain a

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,040
coherent state of what who i'm talking

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,000
to it's it's pretty hard to keep track

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,639
of everything

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,839
and this pandemic has made it worse like

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,320
some of my

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,160
workstation in the office is just

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,160
randomly going off and on because of

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,959
power outages and stuff like that and so

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,560
that's not

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:13,440
fun so i i would definitely like to fix

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,440
this at some point

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,959
and yes i'm on team having a fedora

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,240
project matrix home server i i would

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,720
definitely love

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,320
for us to have one because that would be

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,839
that

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,600
it would just be very cool i think it's

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,399
it's going to wind up being the future

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,240
of

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:39,839
of communications at least in the open

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,839
source realm if not everywhere else

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,360
okay here we go what are some of the

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,440
projects or goals

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:51,600
uh fesco has for fedora moving forward

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,279
past fedora 33 infra or other projects

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,600
um

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,959
wow okay i guess we can all probably say

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,120
something about this

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,200
uh we all know that uh the number of

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,320
change proposals approved right now has

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,440
hit a record

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,480
um and they're not all insignificant

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,079
changes these are

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,279
these are quite uh involved changes that

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,360
are going in

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:18,399
um some have a

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,639
far reaching impact uh probably you know

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,800
every user in some capacity and then

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,440
others are for specific interest groups

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,000
but

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:32,560
i think that what we're going to um

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,200
uh see is uh a lot of attention that we

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,079
have to re

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,320
revisit a lot of these to work out more

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,160
of the details for implementation

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,760
and integration into fedora and that's

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,320
that's kind of what we do

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,800
so um i you know having done this for

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,160
for quite a long time it's sort of the

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:53,600
the up and down cycle of um

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,120
uh you know introduce new new features

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,800
and then go through a period of

00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,079
stabilization and

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,839
sort of almost like reflection on okay

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,440
what are we doing why how do we want to

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,079
you know tweak it and tune it and stuff

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,959
like that

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,320
so i think that that probably is what we

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,399
need to focus on

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:15,040
after this um after these changes go in

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,360
uh hopefully we can hopefully we'll have

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,600
uh resources focused on that but

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,399
it's also hard to say we may see a brand

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,880
new

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,320
uh technology show up that we really

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,240
want to integrate into fedora

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,600
and that you know kind of stretches us

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,800
in again

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,560
i don't know but i guess

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,800
my thing is i would like to see us focus

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,760
on stability of what we're integrating

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,320
now what we've

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,279
uh decided that we're doing now for f 33

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,920
and beyond

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,440
anyone want to add to that sure i can i

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,560
can add a little bit to this because i i

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,839
think

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,000
as the one who is the two i think

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:53,199
arguably most disruptive changes

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,959
to for this cycle uh that is definitely

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,959
out well

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,000
has more probably more quote unquote

00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,680
disruptive is

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,120
the editor change which is not that

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,040
significant but whatever

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,040
um but like the two actually significant

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,040
changes i think what we're looking at

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,440
here is like i i looked back over the

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,079
past

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,880
five years of fedor releases and i think

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,880
what it what

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,240
winds up happening is that i think we're

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,639
starting to hit this cadence where every

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:20,399
five years we wind up having this huge

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,240
boost of like really big dramatic

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,320
you know things that we want to do and

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,560
then we refine those

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,760
over the course of the next five years

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,120
of releases like

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,519
fedora 21 was the beginning of

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,480
fedor.next and or fedora next or

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,920
whatever you want to call it

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,199
and that's when we did the focusing the

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,120
additions and all that stuff and that

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,199
was 62 changes by the way

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,279
that was that that was the high mark

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:45,360
until fedora 33

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:47,279
and over the course of releases from

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,519
fedora 21 to now

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,320
while we haven't necessarily had so many

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,680
changes

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,240
a lot of them have built on that

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,920
foundation that happened in 21

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,320
and what i see what we're doing right

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,120
now is we're laying the foundations

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,240
to iteratively develop and improve and

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,440
stabilize and

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,920
and make these technologies mature for

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,360
the next five years or the next 10 years

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,560
the next 15 years

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,680
like a lot of people see us

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,560
with the perspective of fedora brings

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,600
those features first um and bring that

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,440
innovation

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,120
to the to the wider ecosystem um

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,040
and and sometimes that means that

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,079
there's just a lot of stuff happening

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,839
and sometimes

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,519
and sometimes the schedules happen to

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,560
align in such a way where they just all

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,839
happen at once

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,160
that doesn't necessarily mean it's an

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,360
unstable release it actually shows that

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,279
from my perspective it shows that

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,120
there's a lot of people interested in

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,800
making fedora the best it could be

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,279
and that actually i think is a very

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,680
heartwarming sentiment and really

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,800
um is a testament to how successful our

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,320
community is

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,480
that people want to do this sort of

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,360
thing um and

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,160
we'll we'll see like as we go forward um

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,480
i think we'll

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,199
at least like in my personal roadmap yes

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,279
i did this

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,120
big change but i have plans about how to

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,680
iterate and build up on it and make it

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,919
better

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,799
that are not quite so like huge or

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,520
earth-shattering

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,199
levels of change but we'll see like i i

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,720
want to build upon what i've done and i

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,520
imagine many people

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,079
who have made these very big changes um

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,600
are

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,079
in the same boat they're trying to build

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,720
this foundation to to do something

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,160
better

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,400
and build upon it because that's all we

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,319
do like we we make these changes because

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,799
we have a vision of like how we want to

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,039
move the linux platform forward and this

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,440
is

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,120
this is how we do it so i'm actually

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,880
very excited and i'm

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,480
and i think that if we hit this like

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,840
five year mark basically every five

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,480
years we wind up having

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,400
a relatively big release which has a lot

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,160
of foundational technology

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,520
that then gets iterated on and built

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,960
upon i think that's not bad i think

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,559
that's actually

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,559
that shows that people are doing it

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,559
thoughtfully like if we were having

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,080
every single release we were having

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,000
massive breaking changes

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,679
and then nobody was like reflecting on

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,120
incrementally building fun i think we'd

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,400
be in big trouble

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,559
so so i think we're doing okay um and

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,039
i'll toss it to fabio let's see what he

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:10,720
thinks about it

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,360
um well i've i've been mostly thinking

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,520
about

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,280
how to

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,120
how the changes we're integrating with

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,960
fedora 33

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:25,440
are a bit more um

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,400
do have the potential for breaking a bit

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,600
more things

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,679
than usual i think so

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,480
um i've not really been thinking about

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,600
what to do for fedora 34th at the f-35

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,760
and so on

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:42,880
but right now i'm just

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:46,000
just a bit relieved that things

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:49,280
don't have haven't been blowing up

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:54,400
for fedora 33 right yet

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,400
maybe except for for meals cmake stuff

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,120
well i've i've been helping out by by

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,640
fixing a few dozen packages here and

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,320
there so

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:07,600
uh yeah and it's a lot

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:10,400
igor and i did like 510

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,960
20 or so and it i think the tally was

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,760
like

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,760
almost 1500 so we got a third of the way

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,120
through before mass rebuild

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,200
uh and so like that was by the way

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,200
if you think that it's easy to change

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,679
two lines in every spec file

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,200
no people do those two lines differently

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,440
in every spec file

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,280
and so i have to build and test every

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,919
single one of those locally

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:38,000
and that makes it very slow

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,910
it makes me wish i had a koji to do all

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,440
this stuff in

00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:44,480
[Laughter]

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,360
uh yeah and um i'm

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,919
kind of surprised that switching to java

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,360
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:54,400
from java 8 didn't break more stuff

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,600
which actually worked out quite well i

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,520
think there is one

00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:02,559
remaining problem with a free ipa

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:06,320
where one java component

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:09,679
isn't working right but

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,480
the same version in debian works

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,799
correctly so we're not quite sure where

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,679
the problem is

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,840
um yeah but i think that's that's being

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,480
worked on

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,799
so java 11 is looking great

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,080
matt booth has been working on

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,120
integrating

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:33,120
it back into main repo

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:36,240
from the modules again so that

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:40,320
looking great and yeah

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:46,480
there's lots of stuff that i was still

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:49,440
paying work on anybody want to jump in

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,440
yeah actually uh so i wanted to add on

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,720
to what uh david and neal said

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,559
about this cycle of of

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,080
you know a bunch of stuff landing

00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,520
stabilized whatever

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,440
and i think neil is right that it's been

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,640
a like a five-year cycle

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,919
but i think it's getting shorter i think

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,760
we're going to have to adapt to to

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,280
a shorter cycle and we're going to have

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,159
to do that by

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,520
you know ci automate stuff make things

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,320
easier

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,200
you know just do a lot of stuff so that

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,000
our

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,480
our pace can increase without

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,080
sacrificing that quality or that

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,400
that stability and i think that's going

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,440
to be a big challenge for the next

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,840
you know two or three or four years that

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,799
we

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,200
can get that going um i'm also really

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,640
excited about the lenovo stuff i'm

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,720
interested to see how that's going to

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,400
affect our community are we going to see

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,320
an influx of users

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,600
are we gonna see a influx of

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,440
contributors

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,400
now uh or both uh i hope i'm hopeful and

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,120
i'm

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,240
uh i'm really interested to see uh see

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,200
what happens from that

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,640
so very exciting i think that's i think

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,120
the biggest development

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,080
in linux in the past decade like that

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,559
we're now

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,960
like i mean 10 years ago there was the

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,080
triple e pcs with the netbook remix and

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,520
stuff like that

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,520
and that didn't last very long because

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,159
microsoft killed that with a stone fist

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,240
but

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:20,640
um but you know this time around

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,600
we have some very real plan for success

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,880
we have a

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:28,000
relatively mature linux desktop and

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,600
and and maybe my personal hope for that

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,360
is that maybe more people will start

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,720
focusing on our paper cuts

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,960
because i mean i will be the first to

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,840
admit we've got plenty of those in gnome

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,120
and kde

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,559
everywhere and like that's where i want

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,720
to see us grow

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,840
it's very it's very obvious and i think

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,000
everyone knows that

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,000
but it's just a matter of time and you

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,440
know effort to to get those things and

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,120
sometimes they're hard

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,799
you've got some little paper cut that's

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,679
like oh i'll just fix this in this

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,360
afternoon

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,720
and you know eight hours later you're

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,400
looking at something completely

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,120
different but it's related to the thing

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,120
you need to fix

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,640
i'll tell you right now that's pretty

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,880
much i wound up on

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,240
finally pushing my self over to do the

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,799
butterfest change

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,480
like the impetus was we have this space

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,320
contention issue and i need to figure

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,799
out a way to fix

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,240
how are we going to do like certain

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,080
quality of life improvements for

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,559
pre-loaded laptops

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,280
and every other strategy i could think

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,360
of

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,480
just could not be made to work i i've

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,080
really tried

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,760
and i've looked at what other vendors

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,400
have done and they suck

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,840
like if you look at what system 76 does

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,280
your first experience is you have to

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,760
reinstall your computer

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,400
like straight up though the welcome the

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,600
the

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,000
getting started with your computer

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,600
literally reinstalls your computer

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,880
you you do not have a working

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,000
environment to start from and then

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,720
customize

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,279
so that is an experience i want to avoid

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,440
i want to make it as smooth or smoother

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:55,600
than what people have on mac os and

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,880
windows that is my personal goal with

00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,559
these sorts of things

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,000
and i think that's i think where we're

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,039
going to start seeing more people do

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,840
that with the

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,840
lenovo laptop stuff

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,840
do you have anything to say i don't have

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,480
much

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,480
much to add

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:27,520
i think yeah one thing that maybe is

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,240
uh with the idea to going faster and

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,080
like

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,320
being able to make the make fedora

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,200
like make those big changes more often

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,919
it's all our tooling and

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,200
experience for packages and i think

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,360
there is a lot of

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,559
a lot of work there and that would be

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,679
good

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:50,880
to look at how we can

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,880
we can tackle textbooks

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,480
yeah we do have a um a lot of talk

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,360
around um

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,320
i mean kevin was just mentioning it with

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,960
with ci

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,919
and um all of the efforts around that

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,960
and i think that

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,080
that ties in very closely to um just

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,200
making it easier

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,919
for us to keep fedora updated and

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,400
tie more closely with upstream so things

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,360
that

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,760
are interesting to me which i mentioned

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,679
uh

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,600
in my questionnaire when i first ran for

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,640
fescos the stuff that i

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:30,080
am interested in is is how do we make it

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,320
easier for uh package maintainers and

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,480
developers to have their

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,440
projects built and integrated into

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,200
fedora

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,039
where what are the sticking points right

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,919
now that we can

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,559
make easier and we have a lot of efforts

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,960
underway

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,720
with that right now um and every little

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,200
thing that that we can think about as a

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,360
project

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,720
like before this i was in the uh the rpm

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,799
auto auto spec

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,919
uh talk which is really interesting and

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,440
you think about it it's like

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,760
oh well it's just you know this sort of

00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,000
one little thing in spec files but

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,159
all of those little things added up will

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,360
help us as a distribution

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:08,400
uh and as a project just move faster

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,480
and also have more uh reliable builds

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,919
and reliable

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:17,039
uh reliable output like like

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,679
tested output the the ci efforts help us

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,960
with that

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,720
quite a bit i know we recently had some

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,720
issues with tool chain

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,320
problems neil you had mentioned when we

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,919
used side tags for that so that's like

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,440
another thing like

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,120
you know we should categorize certain

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,880
aspects of

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,320
the project you know these things are

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,840
more important because they directly

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,640
impact other things

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,279
whereas you know a new build of nano

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,480
might not

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:44,159
necessarily impact everyone uh and

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,080
you know so not everything is created

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,600
equal but we need the right tools to

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,000
to do this kind of stuff so i think

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,480
we're gonna have a lot of that

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,400
happen more so throughout this sort of

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,400
stabilization period

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,919
and i think i've talked over some

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:03,520
questions uh let's see

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:05,840
let's see so mike rochefort asks um

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,440
a relationship between red hat and fesco

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,039
has been over the past few years

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,559
and how do you expect the relationship

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,080
to progress over the coming years

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,360
i feel like this is a question i really

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:18,240
can't answer because

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,600
i yeah i i think maybe maybe we should

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,120
have everyone's

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,720
take individually here um because yeah

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,720
i think it's going to be different a

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,159
different view from everyone

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:33,440
um so uh

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,240
the like for me uh you know i'm employed

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,360
by red hat

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:41,520
my manager has told me numerous times

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:44,880
uh i don't expect you to be on fezco

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,440
and also representing the interests of

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,919
rel

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,440
like you are doing this as part of the

00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,000
fedora project

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,480
and this is a fedora thing so fedora

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,039
first

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,120
upstream first so i can say with

00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:59,760
confidence that my role

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,720
in fesco is is purely because i want to

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,840
do it and

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,960
my interest is to make fedora better

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,559
um fortunately the tie with with red hat

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,279
allows me to do that as part of my day

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,480
job i don't

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:15,679
i know that not all of us

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,880
have that ability to to the same extent

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:23,120
but i i feel that red hat

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:26,240
has over the years deferred more to

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,279
fezco decisions for what you know

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,000
upstream uh engineering direction looks

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,360
like for the

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,159
project and i have not seen anything

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,279
come in where red hat will say oh fesco

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,240
we don't really agree

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,840
with this decision you made it's more

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,200
they recognize it and then they

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,840
understand that they have to start

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,480
planning for something different

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,840
in rel if they are if they need to be

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,360
different if it didn't

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,120
you know a change went in that they

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,640
don't want in rel for instance

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,159
um so i i think we'll continue to see

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,039
you know the support for what we do from

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,159
red hat but they don't they're not

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,120
from my point of view they're not

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,600
looking to take over and sort of drive

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,640
things

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:11,679
if if that is a concern anyone has

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,679
and that's my view so over to

00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,520
we're doing the same order here i'm i'm

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,520
going to the next person in my view here

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,200
which is neil

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,880
so my perspective is a little

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,640
interesting here because i don't work

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,840
for red hat contrary to what

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,600
so many people seem to think it's

00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,679
frighteningly bizarre how many people

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,279
think i work for red hat i really don't

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,919
i don't work for red hat i don't work

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:36,240
for souza i don't work for canonical

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,679
uh so like at least not right now at

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,440
least i don't think i do

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,880
um but anyway um my perspective on this

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,080
is that i think

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,840
generally speaking uh relation the

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,440
relationship between red hat

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,399
engineering and fesco is positive but

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,600
weak

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:57,520
so the the general communication between

00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,520
red hat enterprise linux engineering and

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,679
fedora is extremely weak

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,840
um it is it is pretty difficult if i

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,399
wanted to solicit information

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,120
feedback or advice or i just wanted to

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,480
like get

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,399
you know some sense of how they felt

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,000
about these things it's actually pretty

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,520
difficult without some back channeling

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
which i don't like doing

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,919
um i'm good at it at this point but like

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,200
i don't want to i'd like that stuff to

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:23,039
be in the open

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,919
um but in general red hat supports what

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,159
fedora does

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:31,600
and with some very very minor exceptions

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:34,480
um they actually are supportive

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,080
of the changes that we make like they

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,960
they recognize that we're making these

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,960
changes

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,399
to benefit the community to benefit the

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,559
fedor project and

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,240
they also use it as an opportunity to

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,120
take stock of what decisions they're

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,799
making

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,640
and start thinking about like do they

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,360
need to reevaluate their own choices in

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,360
life

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:55,520
um you know like it happens like

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,600
an example that i will probably call out

00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,120
to like my butter has changed

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:03,039
i did actually talk to

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,399
like i did have some conversations with

00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,799
people at red hat

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:08,240
about it before i proposed it i've had

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,679
conversations about it

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,240
actually for about a year before i

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,679
proposed it i've had conversations with

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,799
a number of other people with all the

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,200
different spins

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,240
i've had conversations with the upstream

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,679
projects

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,919
like there was a lot of work that went

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:25,679
up front before i actually proposed it

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:27,200
um in general this what this proposal

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,320
has done is it sparked an interesting

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,799
conversation

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,679
about people's expectations about how

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,799
storage

00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:37,279
should work and how it should service

00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,279
the overall computing experience which i

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,000
think is actually a good conversation to

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,720
have

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
no matter what technology you use and

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,000
this is

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,320
something that i think everyone cares

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,279
about they these changes and these sorts

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,519
of things

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,360
help bring those conversations forward

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,440
to make people think about it

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,200
and you know what i've been particularly

00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,159
happy about is that my employer

00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,200
datto actually the reason i ran for

00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,399
fescues was they said they were

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,799
supportive of me rep

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,840
working in fedora representing fedora's

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,559
interests

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,120
and and also you know being involved in

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,960
the project

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,399
because like i didn't want to do this

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,000
without you know being able to figure

00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:17,600
out if i could squeeze time for it

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,159
my manager his manager and his boss were

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,120
all very supportive of me doing this and

00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,480
like i

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,919
i actually want to see that kind of

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,960
attitude spread and it's nice to hear

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,159
that from david

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,640
that that's basically the same

00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,399
experience he's had within red hat which

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,840
to be fair i expected that because like

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,600
this is red hat and i expected to be

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,760
super cool about working in fedora

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,519
but like it's still nice to reaffirm

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,360
that um

00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,360
and it's also nice that like where i

00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,120
work at datto they're the same

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,120
uh if you're working in an open source

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,000
project and it's an open source project

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,320
that can help you

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,919
and help the community and help you know

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,600
and help datto in some way

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,640
like they're happy to let me do this

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,120
sort of thing and that's the way that

00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,840
it's been

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,519
that's been going and i'm very and i

00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,600
think that

00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,279
there we have while we could go

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,960
downwards i really don't think the

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,480
relationship's going to get any worse

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,360
between red hat and fedora i think it's

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,519
if anything

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,720
it's only going to get better as as we

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,480
do this and

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,159
this mixture for fesco this time where

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,559
it's like i think almost evenly split

00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,799
between red hatters and non-red hatters

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,240
makes it i think a much more interesting

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,080
dynamic where i think

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,320
this becomes much more obvious that red

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,440
hat is supportive of the fedora

00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,360
community

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,039
and not trying to do something like

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,000
strong arming it into doing what it

00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,240
wants

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,279
because because you know it's it's

00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,799
essentially

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,000
we all have to talk to each other we all

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,200
have to work with each other we have to

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,279
compromise and come to

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,960
come to a consensus and they're and

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,679
they're happy with that process because

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,760
they know

00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,200
that it helps makes the best solutions

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,120
that they can even take later to

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,440
productize if they so choose

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,880
so i think right the relationship with

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,360
red hat and fedora is

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,799
fantastic could it's a little bit on the

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,480
communications week

00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,960
but like overall i think it's generally

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,960
very good

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:07,840
communication is hard ah

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,840
yes don't i know that

00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:18,560
so maybe i haven't been invited to the

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:22,240
secret uh let's call holly living in

00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:25,280
fedora meeting yet but no yeah it's uh

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,679
you know the we we just

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,280
like the fact that to be in fiscal or

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,480
just part of the federal community is

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,679
not

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:37,280
is not really something that

00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:39,200
your manager would would ask you to

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,800
to do things specifically in the

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,560
interest of headlights so

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,520
obviously another has some objectives

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,560
and some ideas behind it but

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:51,839
it's much more vision

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:54,000
and like where they would like

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,839
the community to go anything like this

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,440
more than like a specific change or yeah

00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,000
you have to block best video or you have

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,160
to

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,640
to vote for the speak so that's i don't

00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,280
know i

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,079
i don't have like a gun on my on my head

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,780
or anything when

00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:10,640
when i got on changes

00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:14,640
[Music]

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,640
that's it for me i don't know if anyone

00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:21,599
so else i've got a few things to add um

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,320
i agree with the with david and uh come

00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,440
on

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,400
uh uh synopsis of things

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,520
but uh i will add that red hat actually

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,480
has a clause

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,000
in their code of business ethics that

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,800
all employees agree to and that the

00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,240
company agrees

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,839
this is the relationship between the

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,680
company and employees

00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:41,040
that says if you're working for an open

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,240
source if you're working on an open

00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,400
source project

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,160
you do not have to consider the

00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,160
interests of red hat above that project

00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,480
and in fact you can do the opposite

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,320
and that is perfectly acceptable to the

00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,160
the code of business ethics

00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,839
uh which is great i think that's one of

00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,960
the the most awesome things

00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:00,240
uh that any place i've worked says you

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,359
can go against the interests of the

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,000
company

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,520
and it's for an open source project

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,480
that's the way it is you know that's

00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,720
good

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,079
um i would agree that the the

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,640
communication is light

00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,280
between uh red hat or at least

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,920
officially

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,119
and and fesco and i think it's always

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,480
been that way because

00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:24,640
red hat doesn't want to start like

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,200
um uh directing things they don't want

00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,280
to have

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,880
like if red hat had say a representative

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,560
that went to fesco and said

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,920
here's what red hat thinks here's what

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,839
you should do

00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,560
then i think there would be a lot of a

00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:38,640
strange pressure there

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,160
and i think red hat is very cognizant of

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,839
that and don't they don't want to do

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,960
that they don't want to

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:46,800
influence the project the upstream

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,079
project fedora in this case

00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,920
uh you know directly because that's just

00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,400
that's going to result in in less

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:57,359
diversity it's going to result in

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,119
strange consequences and they just don't

00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,760
even want to go there so i think

00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,599
the the the communication is light but

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,680
for a reason

00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,200
uh i didn't think of it that way i

00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,160
didn't think of it that way

00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,680
that's a pretty good perspective in fact

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,920
there have been times when

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,760
i've really wished it was stronger like

00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,680
in the past we've had things where we're

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,680
we're confused we don't know which which

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,680
is the right path and i'm like

00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,599
well we have all these smart people in

00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,440
red hat we can go ask them but then

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,560
they're not going to really say because

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,079
they don't want to influence our

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,079
decision so

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,000
um you know it's a kind of a

00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:35,119
double-edged sword there

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,200
um and i'll throw in a story at the end

00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,520
uh in all the time i've been in fesco

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,839
which is since it's been around

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,720
uh i've had one incident where somebody

00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,640
mailed

00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,480
uh myself and several other fesco

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,320
members and said

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,079
oh it'd be really great if you decided

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,480
this for this thing

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,359
and before i could even reply to it my

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,119
boss

00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:57,200
replied to that and said this is

00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,440
completely inappropriate

00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,599
all of you do not answer this person i'm

00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,560
going to talk to their management

00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,680
done and so i mean they take very

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,440
seriously that

00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,960
you you shouldn't be influencing people

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,720
behind the scenes or

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,400
through a company relationship like that

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,200
and i i think that's great

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,200
so actually fantastic i've never i

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,119
didn't really think of it that way

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,320
again this shows that i'm the outsider i

00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,640
have no idea

00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,880
how this could be perceived and like

00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,760
that that makes a ton of sense to me so

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,880
i mean

00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,400
i think the only thing that i i i kind

00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,839
of

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,000
from a communications perspective i

00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:34,880
think that when sometimes when red hat

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,520
proposals

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,359
come in for changes and stuff like the

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,640
storage instantiation daemon change that

00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,320
came into f33

00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,400
i was super confused for what the point

00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,480
of the thing was because it's not used

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,440
by anything it was a system-wide change

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,839
and you weren't they weren't even

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,040
proposing enabling it and it doesn't do

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:54,480
anything

00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,760
and i i felt like

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,200
i mean yes i can improve it because

00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,240
you're just literally adding a package

00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,560
and doing nothing

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,000
but like what was what is the point of

00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,359
this what are you trying to do with this

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,440
what's your vision

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,400
i i think that's the part i tend to feel

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,560
like is missing

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,920
a lot from a lot of change proposals

00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,880
like if you look at my butterfest change

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,000
there's there's

00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,839
actually a fairly a concrete vision

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,119
laid out in there and a lot of good

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,920
change proposals include this

00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,680
information

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,599
in the benefit to fedora there's a

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,800
somewhat of a visionary statement

00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,240
involved in there

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,920
and and i feel like that's one of those

00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,720
things that i feel like i'm missing

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,480
from a lot of um a lot of change

00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,200
proposals from red hat or otherwise but

00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,040
like

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,640
the storage instantiation damon one was

00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,920
particularly egregious because i had no

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,920
idea what the point of it was

00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,200
and so like that's the kind of stuff

00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,359
that can help us factor into like our

00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,960
own community decision process

00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,760
so like just understanding the bigger

00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,800
picture

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,240
i think helps a lot uh and

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,720
and that's what i feel like i miss most

00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,640
the time when it comes to red hat

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,079
employees who make change proposals or

00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,040
even other people it's not specifically

00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,960
red hat but like

00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,119
i see it a lot more with the with

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,920
proposals of bigger changes by red hat

00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,280
employees

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,839
i think because they expect that

00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,040
everyone kind of already knows and we

00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:14,400
don't

00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,400
and so yeah

00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,160
there's a very small percentage also of

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,880
people

00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,880
red hat employees who are maintaining or

00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,160
doing something for their job

00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,839
and they're not interested in the

00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,960
community for whatever reason they don't

00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,680
have time or they're

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,480
they're just want to focus on their work

00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,160
and they're

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,079
sort of trying to get things upstream

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,200
but it's kind of a secondary goal to

00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,680
their goal of

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,200
you know and i think that happens with

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,920
other people too from other companies

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,680
you know

00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,520
oh get this in fedora all right i'll get

00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,599
it in fedora that's a check mark

00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,119
not a you know i'm i'm wanting to

00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,240
maintain this thing and

00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,960
and see it do better um and you know

00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,319
that's just

00:40:52,960 --> 00:41:00,079
everybody has their own level of

00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:02,960
uh participation there yeah

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,640
um i i think things could be better

00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,359
coming from red hat employees a lot of

00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,640
that

00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:11,359
is leading up to what will eventually

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,040
uh branch from fedora to become the

00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:16,720
basis for a new major

00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:19,520
rel version and some teams at red hat

00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,079
are better participants in fedora than

00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,480
others

00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,200
and when you see changes like that that

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,960
don't

00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,960
really make sense like that storage

00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,359
damon one for me

00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,359
like having having been involved with

00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:33,680
this for a while i

00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:35,119
i sort of read it i was like oh this

00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,560
looks like groundwork

00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:40,640
for something that that red hat wants to

00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,880
explore with rel i don't really know the

00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,960
details of what that would be

00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,800
but they know that if they want it in

00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,960
rel they should work to get it into

00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,400
fedora so that's why they're

00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,960
doing the change proposal um and so

00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,160
ben made the comment and the chat that

00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,200
you know

00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:01,280
while we're not held to you know

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,000
rel's every need and we don't have to

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,960
think about that with our decisions

00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,440
we still do need to remember that rel is

00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,319
uh

00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,200
sort of a downstream consumer of fedora

00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:16,560
and provides us with a lot of

00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:20,000
user types that we don't necessarily see

00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:21,280
every day so i

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,359
i think that's the only thing in the

00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,839
back of my head for that

00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:27,119
i don't really know how to improve that

00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:30,640
interaction with

00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:32,319
with red hat uh employees

00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,839
doing change proposals that are kind of

00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,040
weak um

00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,200
i don't i don't really know how to

00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,119
approach that and how to

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,720
uh how to improve it but maybe we can as

00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,760
a project

00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,880
and i see let's see uh

00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:49,040
we made it to about 11 45 my

00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,319
time uh before we got a modularity

00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,599
question so that was

00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:58,000
pretty good um i'm happy with that but

00:42:53,599 --> 00:43:00,800
people that's

00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,240
um do we want to do we want to take it

00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,160
or do we want it i'll take it

00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,240
pretend like we didn't see it oh i'm

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,960
gonna take it it's more fun this way

00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,240
um uh but yeah when it comes to

00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,240
influence and vision do red hat

00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,640
proposals and requests

00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,000
don't want to say directive come such as

00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,200
the recent one from modularity come down

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,800
from saying this is what we'd like you

00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,560
figure out the details

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,079
uh okay so i think this is a little bit

00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,160
unfair it's a little bit

00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,280
pejorative of how this is being

00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,400
described

00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:33,680
um there's there's a lot of

00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:36,079
the modularity proposal currently that's

00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,280
floating right now that that is trying

00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:41,200
to be worked on

00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:44,400
is essentially was a last-minute request

00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:47,440
by one of the fesco members to

00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,720
produce a generic policy so that the

00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,800
enterprise linux next project eln could

00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,000
start doing default module streams

00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,400
because he essentially

00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
wanted to make it so that whatever

00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,160
policies implemented is

00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,119
essentially usable in fedora as well

00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:06,160
which i think we all felt was fair

00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:08,160
because uh we do eventually want to see

00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,720
that technology stack succeed in some

00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,040
way

00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,800
like resolving the the some of the

00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,560
problems and making it usable

00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,480
for the use cases where it can really

00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,240
help make the platform better

00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,280
is definitely something that we all want

00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:23,920
to see um

00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,480
the way that it it seems to be is that

00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,160
there's

00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,599
a little bit of tension and frustration

00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,280
i mean as an outsider

00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,640
like i tend to have these conversations

00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,280
with these people talking to them trying

00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,800
to

00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,640
shepherd these things through into the

00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,680
right path and that happy paths

00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:40,079
there seems to be tension and and

00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,599
um and a little bit of frustration but

00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,440
they also have a genuine

00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,800
desire to try to make this the best

00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,839
possible thing

00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,839
for the community at large they

00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:51,599
the people that worked on the modularity

00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:53,599
technology stack

00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,200
know they screwed up with the way that

00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,400
they brought it into fedora the first

00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,800
time

00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,160
and they are trying very hard and very

00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:04,800
earnestly

00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:08,079
to fix that as they can keeping in mind

00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:11,520
their uh the limitations that they have

00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:13,359
today and i know that at least i've had

00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,359
conversations with them about

00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:17,520
how do we strategize to pull away from

00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:19,359
this from some of these

00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,200
broken paths into making this a much

00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:23,839
more successful part

00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,280
of of our ecosystem and also keeping in

00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,720
mind that i now have personal and

00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,400
professional experiences

00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,160
where modularity has been extremely

00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,319
helpful to me

00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,000
in the way that it that it works that i

00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,960
do want it to succeed and i want it to

00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,319
be there

00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,760
and it's it's hard these are these big

00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:42,160
fundamental things where like

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,000
we're essentially changing the world in

00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,880
a very big way

00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,560
um and changing the way you think about

00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,079
this in the way that you want to do this

00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,560
is very very hard

00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,520
and getting there is even more difficult

00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,880
uh

00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:58,880
like so um i think it's just gonna be

00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,520
one of those long hard paths to get

00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,560
there

00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,920
but i'm optimistic that things will in

00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,599
fact get better

00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,839
and yes it is much better than software

00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:10,560
collections i just

00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:15,839
software collections hurt they they are

00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:15,839
very painful

00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:20,480
i i don't have anything else to add on

00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,359
what you said neil

00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,880
um it is a a difficult thing to deal

00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:27,760
with but i think overall we

00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,560
we do want to see some success without

00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,560
um

00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:34,480
reintroducing uh things that cause major

00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,160
problems for all users and it's just

00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,720
it's a tedious process

00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,839
uh because it's a it's a tough puzzle to

00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:44,640
work through i think

00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:48,560
um anyone else have anything to add

00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:49,599
on modularity no okay uh so i see does

00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,319
fescos steer

00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:54,480
rawhide as much as release are there

00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:56,640
different criteria for rawhide changes

00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:59,920
to be accepted um

00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:03,520
well uh not not really i

00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:06,560
i so rawhide is

00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:09,200
sort of anything goes with some

00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,839
exceptions it's evolved over the years

00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,920
the general

00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:14,400
expectation is if you're going to

00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,720
introduce a large change that impacts a

00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,400
wide range of users or packages you

00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,880
should do a change proposal

00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,680
it's going to land in rawhide first and

00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,680
then

00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,599
we stabilize there and then release from

00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,280
that um i don't know if anyone wants to

00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:29,760
add any clarification to that

00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,280
but that i don't view it as like a

00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:34,480
separate process at all

00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:38,000
um i don't i don't think

00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:40,640
we ever have really but uh

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,319
point i think i don't know if i've ever

00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,079
perceptualized rawhide as something

00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:45,280
intrinsically separate from fedora

00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,240
releases

00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,440
like it is a rolling release but it is

00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,880
also

00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,559
the release will be right so so like

00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,680
from from that perspective i think

00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:59,280
fesco i think fesco always considers

00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,440
rawhide but we always consider rawhide

00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:06,000
in the context of a fedora release

00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:08,640
so for us they're one and the same uh so

00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,640
yeah that's a good point uh from ben in

00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,680
the chat by the time a release branches

00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,280
it's too late

00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:17,599
so whatever the current release is

00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,400
rawhide is building up to become that

00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,720
next one

00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,440
so the change proposal process is for

00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,520
what

00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,040
that next release will be that's the

00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:28,480
cycle that we're in

00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:30,880
um i uh neil you you know

00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,839
like more than the zero percent i know

00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,040
about open

00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:37,280
souza but maybe there's um

00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,319
maybe some people view like see open

00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,119
souza leap

00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:42,400
or tumbleweed as being like distinct

00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,440
things we don't really do that with

00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,400
rawhide

00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,880
right or the ongoing thing yeah and for

00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,800
in the open sousa world um

00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,720
they don't have a normal stable release

00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,400
anymore so the way that they do it is

00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,599
everything goes into what's opens as a

00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,880
factory they're equivalent of our

00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,119
rawhide tree

00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,079
and factory runs through automated

00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,960
testing

00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:04,880
and when it validates on that testing it

00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,800
is snapshotted and pushed out as a

00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,800
tumbleweed snapshot release so

00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:11,359
open to the tumbleweed is a stabilized

00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:15,760
validated snapshot of factory

00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:17,440
uh and then every four years on the dot

00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,000
three and a half really but every four

00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,280
years on the dot open souza tumbleweed

00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,160
is then branched

00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,599
to become susa linux enterprise and suse

00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,640
linux enterprise is

00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,480
developed in the open with the community

00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:32,559
and then once that is stabilized and

00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,319
released that becomes open to

00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:36,240
leap and sues a linux enterprise with

00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:39,200
package hub and that is

00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:41,280
like that that model means that you have

00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,760
to consider opensuse elite

00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,680
and opensuse tumbleweed as fundamentally

00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,119
separate things and they do wind up

00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,640
having

00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:50,880
slightly different policies slightly

00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,960
different way of handling things

00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,640
so it doesn't matter how fedora does

00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,800
this and so that's

00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,680
so from the fedora perspective a branch

00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,920
is just

00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,760
a fedora release is just a snapshot of

00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,079
rawhide that's all it really is

00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,599
and so from our perspective we look at

00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:08,800
what rawhide

00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,760
is going to be to kind of project what a

00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,920
release

00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,520
will be for users and we try to make a

00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:16,000
decision based on that

00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,839
so from us it's all one in the same so

00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,160
it doesn't directly compare to how this

00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,760
is the world does it

00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:27,520
but i can see how people might mix the

00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:30,000
two in yeah

00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,280
there's a lot of changes that happen in

00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,040
rawhide that

00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,880
do not go through the change proposal

00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,720
process if that

00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,640
was required for everything none of us

00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,920
would ever get anything done

00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:43,839
um there that's why we have like the

00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,200
process to become a package maintainer

00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,280
we trust that

00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,960
overall you know what you're doing and

00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,920
what your responsibilities are

00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,960
so when you hear a fedora developer

00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,480
talking about

00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,240
i got that change into rawhide or

00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,480
something like that that's just

00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:00,160
you know sort of the nature of ongoing

00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,960
development

00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,480
and not something that needed to be

00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:09,839
formalized as a

00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:09,839
change proposal um

00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,839
trying to read have their

00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:23,839
any more questions from people

00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:28,000
just a few sentences i want to to add to

00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,920
uh what david said

00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,880
yes i mean for uh for most

00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,960
small changes in packages that packagers

00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,960
do in their day-to-day work and their

00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,079
day-to-day contributions

00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:44,400
uh there's an update policy for that

00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,880
most people don't seem to know that but

00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:50,079
there's actually an update policy

00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:52,559
and it clearly states what

00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:54,240
updates you can do safely in rawhide

00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:58,079
which updates you can do safely in

00:51:54,240 --> 00:52:01,200
stable releases and in branched releases

00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:03,359
and for example it tells you that

00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:05,680
you shouldn't do so name bumps and

00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:09,920
stable releases and stuff like that

00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:12,240
just the basic principles of

00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,280
making sure that you don't blow things

00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:16,319
up by

00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:20,559
pushing broken things somewhere

00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:23,359
so um it's following the update policy

00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:23,920
for small changes is usually the way to

00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,319
go

00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:29,200
and for bigger changes there's the uh

00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:30,880
change proposals

00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:33,440
like to add a comment to what you just

00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:36,800
said that's very good the update policy

00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:39,839
uh so name changes things like that

00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,760
when that does happen in rawhide and

00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:45,680
catches people by surprise

00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:47,520
i want to remind everyone to not assume

00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,880
that package maintainers were doing

00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:51,200
anything deliberately

00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,559
oftentimes it's a surprise to them as

00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,160
well as you

00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,160
because something may have changed in

00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:58,319
the upstream project that they

00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:00,880
did not catch while they were doing

00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:03,040
updates while they were checking things

00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,520
and so please please don't assume that

00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:08,720
people were doing things deliberately to

00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,680
bypass these processes that we have many

00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,559
projects undergo

00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:14,079
a lot of changes and package maintainers

00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:17,200
do a fantastic job

00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:18,079
staying on top of that restructuring of

00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:21,119
code bases

00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:23,040
build systems things like that um so i

00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,880
i mentioned that because i see mailing

00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,480
list comments where some people

00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,079
you know they're kind of frustrated and

00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,079
then you know they're

00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,359
you know that's it's very easy to fall

00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:34,240
into that trap that

00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:36,480
that assuming people are trying to go

00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,720
around the policies and rules

00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,720
um

00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,839
let's see

00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,920
what are fesco peeps up to these days

00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:51,680
non-fedora related well there's

00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:55,440
something outside of fedora

00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:58,480
um uh

00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,480
well um

00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,319
not a whole lot given there's a pandemic

00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,760
we don't

00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:05,359
we don't have a lot of things that we

00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,760
can do around here most things are

00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:09,119
closed

00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:11,520
but i will say that i had a uh

00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,559
for me i had some new antennas installed

00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,119
on my roof

00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:17,040
and this summer i bought a bicycle it's

00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,000
been over 15 years since i've ridden a

00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:21,359
bicycle so

00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,359
trying to do that again

00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:30,400
i mean for me not a lot i can do

00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:33,119
because again as david said um

00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,880
i'm forced to be a shut-in that that

00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:38,559
makes life a little difficult

00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:40,400
um i mostly i'm actually getting back to

00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:42,640
playing more video games and stuff

00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,680
because like i have a huge backlog of

00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,359
video games

00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,280
that i i've been wanting to play for a

00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:49,119
while and i haven't had any time to

00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,720
and like i'm really using my nintendo

00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,440
switch a lot more and like i've been

00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,520
playing

00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,480
i just got super pepper mario the

00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,880
origami king

00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,319
and i'm having a lot of fun playing that

00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,799
and

00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:03,119
uh you know i i think it's mostly that

00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:05,520
i'm i'm trying to relearn how to relax

00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:07,200
because i haven't done that in a while

00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,599
uh and that has actually turned out to

00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:13,520
be surprisingly difficult

00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:13,520
learning how to relax is very hard

00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:20,480
yeah um i'll just jump in with a few

00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:24,000
sentences

00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:27,119
well i've spent most of my

00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,839
time in july and sometime in august by

00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:32,160
fixing java packages and fixing cmake

00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:35,760
changes

00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:38,319
university has been total chaos

00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,760
this semester so i didn't have much to

00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:43,440
do for that

00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:46,400
and i'm hoping that it'll be better in

00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,839
uh in autumn and yeah i've been cycling

00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:51,200
too

00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:51,200
so that's that's been nice

00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:58,559
i'll go next most of my

00:55:55,839 --> 00:56:00,160
time i spend with the kids that's the

00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:03,359
enjoy of having

00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:06,000
small ones so yeah like going out with

00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:06,000
the family

00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,599
enjoying enjoying the kids

00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:17,119
but yeah so i i don't have the

00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,760
exactly the same surroundings as kevin

00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,599
but

00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:22,319
i have like a mountain stuff really fast

00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:25,359
so i quite like just go for a like and

00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:29,200
that's a good way to relax like just go

00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:29,200
from a day or two

00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:38,000
that's my way to get away and

00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,000
get far from the screen and keep going

00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,559
yeah so uh obviously as others mentioned

00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:48,720
there's been uh

00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:51,280
this sort of pandemic thing going around

00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:53,920
so i haven't been uh

00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,680
um we just moved to this very lovely

00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,240
house in oregon about a year ago

00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,359
and there's a ton of landscaping and

00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:03,520
outdoor

00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:07,520
things that we have backlog work on

00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:09,680
um and of course reading books and

00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:12,079
uh watching shows and all the things

00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:16,160
that that other folks do

00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:19,520
um yeah it's kind of hard

00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:22,000
uh well it's kind of interesting since i

00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,760
spend most of my time at home anyway

00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,760
the pandemic just hasn't really affected

00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,000
me that way but it has affected me in

00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,240
other

00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,520
ways i mean just interacting with people

00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,920
you can see

00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,440
everybody is more tired and you know

00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:36,960
prazzled and

00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:38,000
impatient and um you know it's difficult

00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,079
in these times but

00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,920
uh you know everybody should try and

00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:45,440
relax and

00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:54,640
where they can to uh to be refreshed

00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:56,319
and not burned out so

00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,760
okay i don't know how long this session

00:57:56,319 --> 00:58:00,640
runs um my

00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,839
assumption was an hour it runs as long

00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:05,760
as we're still in here

00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:09,440
oh really oh okay technically it's over

00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:12,720
but it doesn't quit until we all leave

00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:14,480
okay um technically lightning talks have

00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:19,760
started two minutes ago
