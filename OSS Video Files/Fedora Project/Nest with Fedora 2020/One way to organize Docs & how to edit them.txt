um

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,640
so a quick introduction on my side my

00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,519
name is justin

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,719
uh i'm a member of the fedora dni team

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,120
but i've also been

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:19,760
pretty hands-on with the fedora docs

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,880
project two um in 2018 we had a dox fad

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,760
where we

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,279
uh did a lot of stuff about how we think

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,199
about or thinking about how we organize

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,679
our docs thinking about the tools we use

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,399
and so over the last two years a lot of

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:35,520
the fedora documentation

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,800
which was previously in a doc site or in

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,840
the wiki

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:44,000
we've now started to move over to this

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,320
ascii doc-based publishing mechanism

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,520
um the tool the tool chain is called

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,200
antora

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,280
um that's what's actually doing the

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,160
publishing in the docs but we're not

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,879
going to get

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,120
super into that um what i'm really going

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,120
to be covering in today's talk

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,160
is there's not only a talk it's more of

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,680
a shadow session

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,680
so i'm gonna i am gonna talk a little

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,640
bit about how the dni docs are

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,320
structured

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,479
what things we're publishing there right

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,439
now and a little bit about our docs

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,520
efforts from

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,760
over the years then we're going to do

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,439
two two different screen shares

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,680
the first one is going to be editing

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,280
from the web browser so you can edit

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,479
these docs straight from

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,080
pagor the second one which if you want

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,720
to stay for is totally optional if you

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,640
just wanted to get a quick introduction

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,920
but the last part of this is going to be

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,520
more advanced where i'll be working in

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,759
the command line

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,799
rendering the docs locally so if you're

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,840
interested in that

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,720
stay tuned and we'll get to the more uh

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,119
detailed hands-on part towards the end

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,200
so

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,360
i'm going to shift over to my screen if

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,759
you're in the hop in chat you can double

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,880
click

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,119
on the screen share to make it go

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,600
maximized or full screen just so it's a

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,840
little easier to see

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,000
so the page i have open here right now

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,119
is the fedora doc site which i'll go

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,880
ahead and link

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,399
in the hop in chat not much to talk

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,439
about here other than this is where we

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,880
publish our docs

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,959
you can see we have a couple different

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,319
pages this this page is our landing page

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,560
our index page

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,920
where we talk generally about diversity

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,440
and inclusion in fedora

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,840
broadly some of the things that we've

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,200
done there's a page about the team that

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,000
talks a little bit about

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,360
a little bit of overlap actually we have

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,840
an issue open for that

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,440
which we'll be talking about um but

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,959
there's also other pages like we have a

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,480
page about all the events that we've

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,080
done over the years and some of the

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,400
outreach we've done

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,000
um we also have a lot of notes from the

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,040
demographic survey that we did

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,040
at our 2017 hack fest

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,640
um and also things about fedora women's

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,519
day and how to get involved with the

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,959
team

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,480
um things that are helpful like a

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,840
meeting like we have a meeting script

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,959
you know if you want to run a meeting or

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,920
if you want to get a meeting on the

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,120
agenda like we put some of that workflow

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,400
stuff in our docs so you know that's

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,840
great that we have that content but

00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,879
that's not really what this shadow

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,800
session is about

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,000
we want to try to change some of this

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,720
stuff right

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
so for context the doc site used to be

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,000
all of our fedora was

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,640
used to all be in the fedora wiki this

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,599
is from june 2018 so this is like two

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,280
years ago

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,360
the challenge with that was that the

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,560
wiki would frequently fall out of date

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,480
and um also it was just hard to connect

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,319
different pages together like we have

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,080
that nice little sidebar where you can

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,319
click to the different pages

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,159
um don't have that in the wiki so just

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,519
for some historical context like that's

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,760
where everything used to be

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,519
but we're really big on moving to the

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,159
docks because it makes it easier to

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,200
organize

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:40,480
things um and

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,200
keep up with where all of our different

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,720
information

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,560
is which is easier you know if you're a

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,159
new contributor and you're not super

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,080
tuned into the wiki

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,920
um so we are going to be talking a lot

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,519
about this pagwar repo today

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,519
like i mentioned it would be great if

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,840
you can go ahead and

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,360
make a fork of that to your personal

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,280
pagor account

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,200
um we'll if you are a member of the dni

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,439
team you can commit directly

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,280
to the repo but the best practice is

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,640
usually to work from your own fork

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,480
so that's the way i'm going to be

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,080
showing um

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,599
in this presentation today so i'm hoping

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,000
that um if you haven't if you haven't

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,639
forked the repo yet go ahead and

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,320
uh take a minute to do that but i'm

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,880
going to go ahead and jump right into

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,680
this

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,360
so the first way i'm going to talk about

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,759
editing the fedora docs

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,720
is from the web browser so this is the

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,280
easiest way

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,479
i think to really edit our docs you

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,639
don't have to

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,560
set up any tools you you know you just

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,160
have to log into pagor

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,120
and edit so um

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,360
so once you're in in your own fork or

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,199
wherever you're working on the dni docs

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,120
you'll notice that you know there's this

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,080
files tab right over here so if you

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,759
click that

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,280
you can start to actually go through

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,360
some of the different files in

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,360
in the repo there's a lot of stuff in

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,560
here but there's really only

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,160
um one thing that matters which is in

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,120
the modules folder it's a little

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,360
annoying but

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,639
you know you have to uh click through

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,000
here a couple of times

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:15,280
and then you'll see pages and ta-da

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,360
here's all of our um

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,039
all of our docs pages the actual source

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,440
content that gets published

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:25,759
onto the docs.fedoraproject.org website

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,360
so you can open any of these up and you

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,280
know it's going to show you the raw

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:34,080
source text in ascii doc format

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,960
i'm not going to talk a lot about ascii

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,919
doc today

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,000
but i will share some links that have

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,240
that i always keep bookmarked that help

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,479
me when i'm working in asciidoc just to

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,000
reference the syntax

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,759
um and some of the other best practices

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,360
like one of the things you'll see in

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,720
these docs as well

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,800
which is might be different if you've

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,680
never worked in docs before

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,120
um or in fedora docs i should say but

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,639
every sentence

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,080
is its own line um just kind of a thing

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,720
no matter what tool no matter where

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,880
you're editing that's a for

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,120
a best practice we do for a specific

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,759
reason because when you go and

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,880
make a pull request with your changes to

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,440
the docs

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,080
it's a lot easier to review what you're

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,720
actually

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,120
changing if every sentence is on its own

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,120
line

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,960
it makes the get diffs really pretty and

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,440
really easy to review so i don't have to

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,759
spend

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,520
not just me but anybody um can spend

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,520
less time trying to figure out like

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,919
where the line breaks are and

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,600
it it just is easier to review so just

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,840
keep that in mind that whenever you are

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,880
editing the docs you always want to

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:44,000
add a um hard return a new line

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,319
after every period so today i'm looking

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,720
at

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,039
um so let's look at i'm looking at the

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,080
demographic survey

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,160
page here so

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,440
you might have one or two options

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,120
depending on where you're looking

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,360
if you're in your fork you should just

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,360
see the edit button but i'm actually in

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,000
the main repo so it's saying edit in

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,440
your fork

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,759
because that's usually the better thing

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,000
to do so

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,520
in your in your editor or in your in

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,639
your web browser you can go ahead and

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,000
click that um

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,919
edit or actually i guess i was going to

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,800
do the events page in my demo

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,319
so i am going to edit the events page

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,639
and i'm going to walk you through

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:25,039
this um this page really quick

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,479
so i don't think i can resize that

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,000
that's a little annoying

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,280
um so let's pretend that i have um i'm

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,479
gonna add a new event

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,520
i'm going to add fedora nest shadow

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:40,960
session with uh

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,240
our docs and you know normally i would

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,160
add a lot more there

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,520
but you know this is just an example

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,680
right so

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,120
um so let's say i added you know more

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,479
info about

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,080
the this nest session we did right um

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,680
i'm gonna talk through these four things

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,759
really quick the first one is the email

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,520
address which isn't really huge but

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,599
if you care just remember that this

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,520
email address is public information

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,879
so um it is it it is public whatever

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,000
email address you choose

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,759
um just an aside but i'm really going to

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,199
talk more about the branch part because

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,960
that this is actually really important

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,879
and is one of the biggest pain points i

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,280
see for folks who are doing this

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,800
it's it's the default is to commit

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,120
straight to master

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,560
but it's actually a better practice is

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,000
if you do what's called feature

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,840
branching and if you split

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,680
this out into a new branch so it

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,479
there's a couple reasons for doing this

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,120
one is that from a get perspective it'll

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,279
be easier to manage

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,080
your fork like i never commit to the

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,560
master branch i always keep my forks

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,680
master branch synchronized to the

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,440
upstream repo

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,519
just because i find you avoid get

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,440
conflicts and some of the more painful

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,240
parts of git if you can

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,279
not commit to the same default branch as

00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,519
the upstream

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,839
so in this case it's the master branch

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,040
so i'm just going to name this one

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,839
new nest event like it doesn't matter

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,160
what the name is just do something

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,839
unique um

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,519
commit title this is you know nothing

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,800
nothing different here but it is

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,000
important to actually make something

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,760
meaningful because this is what's going

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,160
to be your pull request this is what you

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,680
know an actual dni team member or anyone

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,720
not just you know whatever docs repo

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,920
you're looking in

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,279
someone's actually going to read this

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,399
stuff right like another like a real

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,080
human being so

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,000
it's important to write something that's

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,560
a real human being could

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,600
could understand and uh make sense of so

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,200
i'm going to say ab

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:38,080
fedora nest shadow session

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,120
and let's pretend i added pictures

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,320
screenshots

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:46,160
and summaries of the

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,080
nest session i did um you know

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,240
you don't have to write an essay in here

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,279
but just something that makes sense

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,880
something that would actually help

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,920
someone review your changes or more

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,240
importantly understand

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,600
why why you're making the changes that's

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,800
really what

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,519
um is is important to note in here

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,079
so okay i did that i did my whole edits

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,560
i

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,800
added all this stuff um if you're

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,399
working with ascii doc the first time

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,000
it might be a little awkward but don't

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,360
worry about it too much like that's why

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,600
we do the pull request

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,800
process is there's a review process

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,440
someone will actually review your

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,839
changes

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,480
and give you feedback if everything

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,839
looks good

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,040
and they'll merge it or if there's

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,560
something that needs to be changed

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,320
you'll have a chance you know

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,920
you're not going to be writing changes

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,680
straight to the doc site so there is a

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,880
review process the team is really

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,839
friendly so

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,000
you know don't it's good to double check

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,160
your syntax and stuff but don't

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,920
don't panic if you're not really

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:44,079
familiar with ascii doc

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,560
um so that's it we'll do commit changes

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,079
and uh it's gonna pagor is going to

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,000
commit my changes it's actually making

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,959
that new branch that i made the

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,640
events nest what you're gonna call it

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,839
new nest event branch so it made that

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,480
branch and you can see

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,480
hey this branch contains one commit

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,200
that's not in the upstream fedora

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,200
diversity

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,519
master branch and i have this handy

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,320
button to create a pull request

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,000
um yeah so let's do that let's create a

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,160
pull request

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,760
and uh it's going to take you know just

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,279
like i typed in earlier there's my

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,720
commit message summary there's the

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,720
commit message description

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,000
it pre-populates the pull request with

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,200
that info

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,839
you can see i have my uh super simple

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,880
change that i'm not going to merge

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,839
because it's

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,680
um just an example but let's create the

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,000
pull request just to show what it looks

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,160
like

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,640
so now you'll see there's a new pull

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,360
request open in the fedora docs repo

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,399
for the diversity team you can see the

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,720
files change

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,440
the commit messages and all this i did

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,839
straight from

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,640
pagor the web interface didn't even

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,640
clone the repo

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,399
this isn't really doc specific but on

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,200
our side for the dni

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,399
team usually if you make a change to our

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,600
docs you can expect

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,120
that um i try to always assign someone

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,200
if someone's going to review the change

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,079
and take responsibility to be the one to

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,279
merge it

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:10,320
i usually try to assign someone

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,560
but usually expect like within

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,839
it also depends how big your changes are

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,680
or whether you're changing something

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,120
like a policy on our team which

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,279
is something that we all the team all

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,040
votes on versus like adding an event

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,600
if it's something simple expect within a

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,200
week but

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,040
there's some of the bigger stuff that i

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,240
mean this is just an example and i think

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,079
really the point is um

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,680
you can expect like for simple changes

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,680
and just improving the docs it's usually

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,040
a weak turnaround time

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,079
um so that was the web

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,600
interface part of this

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:46,000
i will go ahead and do a quick

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,800
pause if there's questions in the chat

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,519
about anything i covered in the web

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,639
interface piece before i move to the

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,600
more advanced part

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,800
and if you do want to jump out now now

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,959
is a good place if you want to

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,800
transition to something else

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,320
the rest of this shadow session is going

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,839
to be more technical i'm going to be

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,680
working in the command line

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,480
rendering the docs locally showing how

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,040
that actually looks

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,079
so if you want if you want to learn that

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,200
stay right here

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,240
but otherwise that is the direction

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,600
we're going to go

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,079
next so i don't see any

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,880
questions in the chat but i will keep

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,120
watching that

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,880
if anything comes up so i'm going to go

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,519
ahead and update my screen

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:34,720
share and go to the place where i spend

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:38,639
a lot of my time

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,640
cool so i think i'm sharing my

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,040
my my terminal window again um

00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,959
[Music]

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,800
so again as a reminder if you double

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,360
click on the screen share you can make

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,360
that go

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,839
full size so it'll be a little easier to

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,639
see i'm going to zoom in so you can

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,680
actually read what's on my screen

00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:01,199
so just to get some context really quick

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,360
um i have

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,040
uh if you're doing this for the first

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,800
time you take it from your fork

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,399
do git clone um and clone your fork

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,120
going back to that feature branch

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:16,560
workflow i look i talked about earlier

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,320
um i always add a new remote

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,760
to the upstream and you actually have to

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,199
do that like git add

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:26,639
remote upstream

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,160
url blah blah blah blah blah um

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,920
so and you can get that all from the

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,760
pagora web interface there's that little

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,600
clone menu in the top right corner

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,920
that's where you can find this stuff

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,959
um so this is how i normally like

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,360
initialize my

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,279
my get repos as i always have my fork

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,560
and i always have an upstream

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:48,079
the origin and the upstream um

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,480
so with that out of the way

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,279
um let's talk about the branches a

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,040
little bit

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,600
so i'm gonna do that i'm gonna do the

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,839
same thing that i just did in that last

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,199
pull request just to do a pretty easy

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,800
comparison

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,320
um so i'm also going to try not to use

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,560
my aliases

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,920
because those are not intuitive so i'm

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,760
going to make a new branch

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,199
and i'm on the master branch maybe one

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,639
thing that's important to do here that i

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,480
always do before

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,320
i start working is i always make sure

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,399
that if i'm in the master branch or the

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,959
default branch whatever it is

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,639
i have the latest changes from upstream

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,519
in this case i did this five minutes

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,120
before i

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,120
went on video so i know i have the

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,040
latest changes but what that's doing is

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,160
i'm actually getting um

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,480
you know making sure that i have the

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,360
latest changes the latest commits from

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,880
upstream

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,519
so i do so i'm going to go ahead and

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,399
make my uh feature branch oops which is

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,360
going to be get

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,959
checkout i'm i'm gonna use the new

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,959
branch

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,480
and let's say change i'm gonna do the

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,440
same thing change events

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,759
um different branch name but same edit

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,040
so

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,600
i like to use vim but of course you can

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,959
use

00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:00,160
any editor that pleases your your heart

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,759
i'm not going to talk about this um ooh

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,680
translation questions that's that's a

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,120
great question actually and i want to

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,639
make sure i cover that

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:11,360
um so for this edit

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,480
i'm going to do the same thing i'm not

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,399
going to spend a lot of time

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,160
in here but you know going to the same

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,519
thing fedora oops

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:23,040
um fedora nest shadow

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:26,639
session on editing the dots

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:30,320
and pretending

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,800
there is a lot more content here

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,600
so that's great um so we have that in

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,440
the events page

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,519
i'm in my feature branch so let's say i

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,399
do a bunch of i do all my edits i do all

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,440
the

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,480
things i want to do in my text editor of

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,199
choice

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,000
um i'm ready to make my pull requests

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,680
now

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,440
so i always do well depending how your

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,920
workflow is you know you always have to

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,040
add

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,920
the get page to your staging area

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,680
so i've added it um now i'm going to

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,880
commit it

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,880
i always add the um s flag

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,559
to my git commits maybe that would this

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,160
would be a good just quick chance to

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,360
actually explain that

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,400
um what that actually means

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,720
because i get that a lot so yeah um sign

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,760
off this is just kind of this um

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,760
basically it just means that

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,439
it adds this line that says signed off

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,439
by your name

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,039
and your email to the get commit and

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,080
it's just a way of certifying that

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,520
you're

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,039
agreeing that you have the rights that

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,440
the work you're doing is actually yours

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,720
you know

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,559
you have the rights this is your

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,160
independent changes and you're agreeing

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,600
to share it under the same

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,760
license as the original project um not

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,799
really important but it's just a habit i

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,480
do and

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,080
people ask about it so that's why i

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,840
always mention it

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,200
but i'm going to do that now git commit

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,559
and you can see there's my

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,880
signed off message but i'm going to do

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,240
the same thing here added a or i'm going

00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,799
to say events

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:04,480
add a nest 2020 session

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:07,600
to our events i'm gonna say uh

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,600
it was the shadow session

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,360
it was great so much fun

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,919
so i'm gonna do that and i have to type

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,559
in a

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,760
password um cool so i made the good

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,960
commit that's done

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,440
that's on my feature branch um

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,240
and now if you're working locally as a

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,840
reminder

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,840
you know all those changes are still

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,120
local i haven't actually pushed those

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:36,720
anywhere so let's actually go ahead and

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:40,080
push these changes i have locally to

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,960
my fork repo in pagor so

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,799
for the first time i do this um i am

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,440
going to

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,000
push my feature branch to my fork gonna

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
do that

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,200
and if you're in the command line you'll

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:57,200
also note that uh

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:59,919
pagor gives you this handy little url

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,640
there oh what do you know create a pull

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,840
request

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,360
it knew exactly what i wanted to do

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,880
i'm not going to click that because that

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,400
means i have to change my screen share

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,919
again but you would click that up and

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,760
you would get the exact same pull

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,880
request interface that i just

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,080
showed earlier in the web pr part of

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,120
this talk

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,360
um nothing too crazy there

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,679
but the last thing i do want to talk

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,880
about which was the docker piece the the

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,240
containers

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,960
um so you'll notice that in every docs

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,559
repo

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,960
that you know there's also um

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,960
this template repo that the docs team

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,240
maintains that's kind of the base for

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,679
any new

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,679
uh doc site um

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,720
but it comes with this build and preview

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,200
script and that

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,960
is how you're actually going to say you

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,679
know we made the changes but you want to

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,280
test

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,919
this is also really key if you're doing

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,440
um cross page references like xrefs

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,280
you it's a good idea to test your

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,880
changes because that syntax can be

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,159
really confusing

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:06,080
so this assumes you already have

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:09,360
um docker podband a container runtime

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,960
installed um so i'm going to go ahead

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,960
and run these scripts and you'll see

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,520
oh this build script is using podman to

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,520
run in an isolated environment

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,840
so it's actually building it's using the

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,840
docs tool change

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,880
um ascii binder and

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,679
antora all that good stuff and you say

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,080
and you see hey

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,679
okay here's the doc site so now i am

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,480
going to have to update my screen share

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,799
because

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,799
um

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,600
i'm going to open this in a new browser

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,200
window and you can see that i did open

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,240
it because there's all the web traffic

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,039
logs

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,060
um let me update my screen share one

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,760
more time

00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,720
[Music]

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,400
ta-da and you might have to double click

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,600
my screen again if you want to see it

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,200
full size but

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,520
uh big thing you'll notice here is

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,120
localhost yeah i'm all local this is all

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,559
on my machine i'm not on the official

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,880
fedora dock site

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,799
so gonna go to the events page because

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,000
that's where my change was

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:08,240
and uh ta-da there it is

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,799
um and if i was looking at this normally

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,039
i'd be oh wow we used bold on all of

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,799
those so i probably want to make that

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,840
bold so it matches the

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,679
syntax of all the others um

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,520
one of the great things about you know

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,559
testing the changes locally is you can

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,159
actually see these things and be like oh

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,320
that's that's weird i should make that

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,559
bold um

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,919
anyways if you have issues with that

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,600
it's likely um

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,320
i know i've had troubles with the the

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:40,320
local build preview before as well

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:42,080
um if you have challenges i recommend

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,559
jumping into the fedora docs

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,000
irc channel or matrix group the folks

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,320
there are really friendly and

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,039
are really they do the stuff day in day

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,039
out

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:56,080
um so if you have troubles with it

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,679
come reach out to us there um it's all

00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,280
usually going to be in the container

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,640
runtime piece and this is also true

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,720
whether you're working in the dni team

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,480
docs or like any

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,919
any doc site like that was actually

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,760
something like that build script is

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:11,039
something that's bundled in that

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,799
fedora docs template project

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,200
so this is basically true if you want to

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:19,360
test your changes this is basically true

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:22,720
of um any fedora docs

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,000
repo so

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,679
i would have liked to have gone a little

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,080
more in detail to maybe show some of the

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,760
more

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,360
like interesting stuff like doing those

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,400
cross page links and

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:35,120
some of the other syntax um if you

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,440
are interested in those things i suggest

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,480
you

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,080
hang out if you have a dni team specific

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,120
docs there

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,360
if you have a general question about the

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,960
docs again plug in the fedora docs

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,400
team fedora docs on freenode i think at

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,440
fedora underscore

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,360
docs on telegram um

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,559
folks there are happy to help with that

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,240
but um

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,320
i won't have time to cover that today

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,320
because my session this we're officially

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,880
done in one minute and the keynote is

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,559
in five so i'll take a quick moment i

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,200
know this was kind of a lot to cover

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,320
in the time that we had i hope it was

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,080
helpful

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,600
but i'll take any questions or if you

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,559
want to come on the video too

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,880
happy to answer questions on audio video

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,600
or

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,520
in the text chat oh oh there was the

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,120
question about the translations

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:29,760
um which i did see i thank you eduard

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:33,120
and misk for jumping on that in the chat

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:37,840
um i'll just mention

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,840
ooh uh translate.fedora

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,760
um so this is the site that we do our

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,480
translations on

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,360
and like very recently as in the last

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,840
month

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:52,080
um we started getting our docs

00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,679
repos better synchronize there

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,279
um i don't know what the right way to

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,840
describe it would be but again um

00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,799
jebek uh he's the person who really

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,679
drove a lot of this

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,200
who drove most of this work um he's a

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,039
great person to ask

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,480
but there should be yeah you can see

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,400
actually see here's some of the fedora

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,440
docs repos like the fedora release notes

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,520
that's probably one of the most

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,880
important ones in terms of translations

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,440
because

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,279
that happens every release um now

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,919
obviously

00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:23,919
f26 is not really important

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,720
right now um i guess there's not an easy

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,679
way to

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,000
filter old pages from the old but you'll

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,240
see if you go probably to the last page

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,679
there'll be fedora 33.

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,600
um this is only going to be a thing with

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,919
like the the release specific

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,240
docs like the release notes most docs

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,799
aren't going to be um

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,559
structured this way but uh this is the

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:47,520
release notes so it's kind of

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,880
the special snowflake of uh of our docs

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,559
but anyways this is where you can

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,640
you can make those edits and translate

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,880
our docs into your own local languages

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,840
so you do that all through the web late

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,760
the web light

00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,000
site um this makes me realize i need to

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,240
make

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,080
sure that the diversity docs are in here

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,279
so that is a great thing that i'm going

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,720
to follow up with

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:10,159
after this um but this is yeah generally

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,520
this is where you'll do the translations

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,279
and i am personally like i'm very

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,440
interested in trying to um

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,360
bring more translations to the dna team

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,279
docs because

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,880
that's i think it makes a lot of the

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,200
work that we do more accessible and we

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,880
have a lot of folks who do the um local

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,720
fedora women's day events like i'd love

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,400
to get more spanish content because i

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,520
know we have folks who are spanish

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,039
speakers

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,760
that use our are a lot of the dna team

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,159
docs

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,840
so you know that's kind of my my one

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,159
thing that comes to mind and hindi for

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,600
sure

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,600
as well because we do a lot that's the

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,000
second one we have south america and a

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,000
lot of

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,600
events in india as well i just know it's

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,120
trickier with the local languages

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,960
in india um but cool i don't want to

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,720
hold everyone up from the keynote so i

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,000
