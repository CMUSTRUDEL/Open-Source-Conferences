and uh i am a part of the design team

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,760
i have been working on badges um

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:31,039
for the last five five months and

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,559
i just conducted a session on

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:37,280
inks and inkscapes basic demo and this

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,200
is an extension to that this is actually

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,800
a more hands-on workshop

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,160
so um if you guys could follow along

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,680

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,879
two-hour session so what we're going to

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,760
do is we're going to

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,239
design some badges today and hopefully

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,000
it will be fun for everyone

00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,160
okay so um

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,760
i like this is supposed to be a very

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,920
inter

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,199
every year vlog and but since we are

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,560
here right now

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:12,159
it's hard for me to see you guys or

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,840
hear you guys so i would like you to be

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,080
really active in the chat box if you

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,960
have any questions any queries any

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,159
doubts

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,200
just ask me right there and if you want

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,960
if you want me

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,479
if you want to share your screen or if

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,920
you want to show me something

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,880
you can even request i think there is a

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,759
button there somewhere which says share

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,520
or

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,680
ask to join or something like that so

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,320
you can do that and if you have any

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,119
query

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,439
any doubts so you can just click on that

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:45,920
button i will add you to the

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:48,960
um screen and then we can talk about it

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,960
okay so

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,159
okay how many of you have designed

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,840
a badge for fedora you can do a plus one

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,280
or a minus one

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,240
in the chat box i'm asking so that i can

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,240
make sure

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,080
to adjust the workshop accordingly

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,039
so if you have ever designed a badge for

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:15,680
fedora before or

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:19,680
maybe you did try once oh okay

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,879
oh great i know sneejo works in the

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,760
badges team

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,360
so it's great to have someone from the

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,200
technical side here

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,280
there are some technical things i do not

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,319
know so hopefully the health can help

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,519
with that and

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:39,840
okay great so um has

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,840
any of you worked with in skip before

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,680
or maybe they've done a little graphic

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,879
design oh you have

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,840
nice that's great

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,080
okay that will make things a lot easier

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,599
then

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:57,920
um okay so i guess

00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:02,319
we will start now i'm just gonna

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,319
share my whole window

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,440
right so i have prepared a

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:13,200
slideshow um a presentation

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,120
and this presentation is available in

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,800
the

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,519

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,040
going to drop the link in the chat box

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:50,560
i unheard

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,720
right so this is the link um wow i can

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,239
see a lot of

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,159
sphere right there so this is the

00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,840
link so you can go right there if you

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,680

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,280
otherwise i'll make sure that i drop all

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,560
the links that i have in the chat box

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,560
so let's start

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,720
uh

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,720
so

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,959
sorry about that there we go

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,040
so this the first thing we're going to

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,160
do is we're going to discuss the batch

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,680
itself

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,800
wait let me present it right

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,800
before anywhere

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,600
so this is the anatomy of a badge

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,000
so what we're discussing here is how

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,600
like the different layers

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,440
in a badge so this is the

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,080
wait let me just put my phone inside and

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,759
there we go okay so this is the outer

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,960
ring so that okay so a badge has

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,400
different layers

00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,320
and you have to make sure that these uh

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,680
all these different layers are present

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,320
in your patch

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,280
if they're not um you might want to

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,280
recheck and

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,919
redesign your batch because all of these

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,199
are in some way or the other necessary

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,240
for a badge to be

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,960
like a hundred percent complete so

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,000
this is the outer ring this white one

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,680
right here

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,919
this along with the drop shadow so

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,440
you can see this my mouse pointer this

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,560
is the drop shadow and this

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,680
white outer ring

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,240
this is the base you could say of the

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,840
patch

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,759
then we have this colored ring

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,919
so this color ring actually indicates

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,000
what categories we have so we have six

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,759
categories of badges

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,520
um let's see we have content community

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,600
quality miscellaneous call

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,039
quality did i say quality already

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,319
there's development

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,800
and content community

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,479
already i think i got all of them maybe

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,600
i think i missed something

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,600
but we we will check it out later

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,440
okay so we have six different categories

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,440
and different colors indicate different

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,199
categories so this is the blue one

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:16,880
so this indicates the content

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,680
category we have this background right

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,759
here

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,000
this bag these backgrounds are also

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,560
related to the subcategory

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,360
um we will discuss more of this in depth

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,520
later when we discuss the style guide

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,360
this is the pattern if you can see these

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,440
tiny baby lines so there are different

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,560
patterns that you can use in your patch

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,319
these waves are just one of them uh

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,680
while it is not a hundred percent

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,840
necessary to use

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,680
this pattern like all the other layers

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,720
are definitely necessary

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:51,039
but this pattern you don't need to use

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:54,479
um if your artwork doesn't go with it

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:56,880
yeah and then this is the i would say

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,440
uh the part where more that most people

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:03,120
find intimidating the graphic

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,039
hopefully after today um

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,199
you people won't find it intimidating

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,440
anymore and actually have fun doing this

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:13,120
part this is actually my favorite part

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:16,720
so yeah let me just check if there are

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:20,400
any questions

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,400
not good to go okay

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,840
so let us just so the first so how

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,759
this workshop is going to be structured

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,039
is for the first 15-20 minutes we are

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,720
going to discuss

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,479
uh the resources we have the

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,639
infrastructure the websites we're going

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,080
to discuss that and then we are going to

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,960
start with the hands-on part of the

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,319
workshop

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,160
where we're going to design our own

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:46,240
badges so this

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:49,280
is the badges website

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,840
and it has essentially all the badges

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,440
here

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,599
so you can see these are the latest

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:58,639
awards nahal is right here you just got

00:07:53,599 --> 00:08:00,240
the uh nest attendee badge and a lot of

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,280
you will find your name here

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,560
periodically if you are

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,360
collecting this badge and so we have a

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,639
leaderboard

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:17,039
sort of thing here and

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:20,160
this this is the explorer um

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:23,919
section so you can

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,319
see random badges here people

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,360
tags and you can generate reports

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,759
depending on

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,400
whatever you however you want to filter

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,000
it

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:41,120
and this is my favorite part

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:43,360
of the whole thing

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,959
this so this is the vag index so this

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,640
has all the batteries that

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:51,040
have ever been made and it's essentially

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,320
um you could say sort of a holy grail if

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,519
when you're designing a batch

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,720
because you will come a lot here to

00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:02,000
get inspired use different artworks

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,600
so as you can see we have content

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,839
category development

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,360
community event i think i missed events

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,560
last time

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,560
event uncategorized you have quality so

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,880
if you scroll there are a lot of

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,519
badges and that means that you have a

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,279
lot of artwork to reuse and remix

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,200
so the graphic part that people are

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:25,600
generally intimidated by

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:29,839
you can just you reuse these graphics

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:33,440
and remix them and you'll be good to go

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:36,240
okay so as you can see we have a lot of

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,519
different badges

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,519
if let's say

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,360
[Music]

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,120
okay let's go to this one this is the

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,480
nest attendee badge

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,399
this is the one that you are currently

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,519
getting i just want to show you

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,519
um how you can download these artworks

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,200
okay so this is essentially the batch

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,959
profile

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,120
and if you see right there there is the

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,200
criteria and

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,320
if you click on it this will redirect

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,399
you

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,560
to the ticket to the actual ticket where

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,600
someone requested this badge

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,640
and you can see so

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:18,160
i worked on it and uh

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,320
so these svg files you can see

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,360
this and this is the png file so you can

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,640
download

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,640
all of this so if you click on it

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,720
you can just download it it's that easy

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,920
so and

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,160
this is like you can do this for

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,800
almost almost all of the batteries some

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:42,560
of the older badges have missing svgs

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,600
um but honestly like there are enough

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,680
badges out there

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:51,760
that you can use the artwork from so

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,760
yeah this is the website

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,360
i'm just going to drop the link i'm so

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,360
sorry i totally forgot

00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,839
just so that if you want you can explore

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,839
it on your own also

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,560
okay i'm just going to drop this one

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,279
also the next thing we're going to

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,720
explore

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:19,200
is the badges repo on pager

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,600
so oh i

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,360
we can copy paste that one i forgot the

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,640
initial part so we can just copy paste

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,760
that

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,959
anyway so

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,200
this is the the your this is the badges

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,800
repo and picture so this is where people

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,640
open tickets and this is actually where

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,640
you go if you want to design a batch

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:47,279
so when you click on it this thing opens

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,160
up so just go to issues

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,959
and you can see that there are 111 open

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,880
issues

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,000
so you can use any one of them you can

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,399
just open any one

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,680
so this is the one where i stored my

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,639
slides

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,600
um this is someone asking for a badge

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,639
for the

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,600
uh ltn group member so basically you can

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,959
find that

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,880
um some of these uh issues are tagged

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,399
so a good first issue is something that

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,279
you can start with

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,839
um so these indicators are really

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,519
helpful

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,959
if you're starting out with some if you

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,600
want to start out with something that is

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,680
easy

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,240
you can just filter you can go with

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,240
artwork needed artwork needs improvement

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,000
even adverb needs improvement i found it

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,120
pretty easy to do because you already

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,920
have the artwork

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,160
you just need to tweak it so if you are

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,480
intimidated by the prospect of

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,480
designing an artwork from scratch you

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,720
can do this um

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,399
these are the different categories you

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,480
can go difficulty easy if you want to

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,040
start with something easy

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,160
a good first issue or outreachy 2020

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,440
these are good issues

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:54,240
if you are new to designing badges

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,320
the ready to push badges are actually

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,440
already designed

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,000
they just need to be pushed so if it's

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,079
if it's that ready to push don't bother

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,680
with it i would say because the

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:13,760
badge is already designed

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,760
okay so let's move on to the next one

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,760
okay so basically that is i just

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,680
discussed this so there are tags for

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,519
different badges categories

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,000
they are easy intermediate and hard

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:31,360
tickets and easy is great for newbies

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,040
and look for this good first issue um

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,480
that when i started contributing that's

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,560
what i did i started with good first

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,519
issue and after each 2020 tags

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,040
um you might find and go through make

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,560
sure that you go through the whole

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,839
um ticket because a lot of times what

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,160
happens is

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,920
um let's see

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,120
let's see okay so this one let's pick up

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,120
this one so this is a

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,440
this is ready to push right but let's

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,519
say for a moment it was not so

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,760
sometimes what happens some like people

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,519
work on it but they may leave it

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,839
uh halfway they may not be able to

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,680
complete it so you can find the svgs

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,040
here and you can continue with that you

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,839
don't need to

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,519
um start over

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:20,639
so just make sure that you go through

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,839
everything really carefully uh

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,639
because this is where the

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,680
like this is where it's mentioned um

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,839
what kind of batch

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,880
uh the person who opened the ticket is

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,440
looking for

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,920
so a lot of times people here they

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,880
suggest

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,880
uh so this is a part of the ticket where

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,240
people are asked if they have any ideas

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,199
for output concepts

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,000
this one doesn't but sometimes people

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,720
give a very

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,079
specific um idea of what they're looking

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,160
for

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,440
so yeah and sometimes when a design team

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,079
member reviews

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,720
the designs that is also really helpful

00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,800
so

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,240
like you can see marie here has uh

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,199
reviewed this

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,560
the upper badges so you should always go

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,399
through all the comments before you

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,360
start working on the badge

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,839
that will make your work like very easy

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,360
or

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,880
you might not even have to do a whole

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,040
lot here

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,480
so a lot a bunch of different people who

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,240
worked on it this one

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,440
and i actually did this so what happened

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,240
was when

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,760
uh when this was uh when i picked this

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,639
up there were all there was already some

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,839
artwork

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,440
so i just made sure that it complied

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,920
with the style guide and then it was

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,519
good too

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,880
so it was uh i would say a day's work so

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,079
just make sure that you go through all

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,360
the comments

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:45,279
i'm gonna see if there are any okay

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,040
if you have any doubts just pop this

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:50,399
right here and

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,839
i am regularly checking

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,160
so if you have any queries or if you

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,600
want to point something out i mean i

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,600
honestly

00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:02,720
i even i am a newbie so

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,759
okay so this the fedora badges design

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,680
resources so

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,680
now that we're actually design designing

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,240
a badge there are some great design

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:14,160
resources that you already have set up

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:18,000
so if you

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:21,199
go to this link right here this is the

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,600
docs for the badges and you can see

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,839
that honestly everything that i'm going

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,360
to cover in this presentation

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,959
it's right here like you could just read

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,240
through it

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:37,279
so it's really helpful this uh

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,600
dog space so it has this style guide so

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,920
let's start with the style guide

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,680
so the the important thing to notice

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,040
that the design resources that we need

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,279
is the style guide

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,639
the backgrounds the template and the

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,120
actual content

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,680
so let's start with the style guide so

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,199
this is the style guide and if you are

00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:01,199
unsure of how to start making a badge

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:02,639
or how to basically

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,720
what are the rules that you need to

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,839
follow make sure that you read this

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,959
properly and you are

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,959
constantly uh referring to this guide

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,039
when

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,199
because there are a lot of common

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,160
mistakes that we make when we start out

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,240
and this pat

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,520
this guide actually helps you avoid

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,000
those mistakes

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:28,160
so you do not you do not waste time

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,480
so these are the different categories

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,520
you have six different categories

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,799
so it actually tells you what color so

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,480
even if you do not

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,799
did not know that there were different

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,640
colors for different categories if you

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,000
review the style guide you will be

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,400
informed

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,720
so these are the different categories

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,520
and each category also has a certain

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,760
like

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,840
background color associated with it

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,880
which is not very hard and fast you

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,600
could say

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,480
but it would be great if you could you

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,400
know

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,559
try to adhere to it so that all the

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,760
badges are

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,520
have a uniform style the thing is um in

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,520
open source projects like these we have

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,400
a lot of different contributors

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,320
and something uh like design something

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,760
like the badges which is this huge

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:18,720
repository of different designs um

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,400
if there was no style guide it would be

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,880
all over the place right because each

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,720
person has their own unique art style

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:29,360
so if you follow this style guide it

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,320
makes sure that there is a uniformity

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,559
and all the badges look similar

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,559
so

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,320
so these are the different categories

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,880
this is the color palette so like

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,160
you see what i mean when i say that this

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,440
this side has everything you will need

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,880
so these these are the different

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,880
patterns that i talked about

00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:02,480
sometimes you might even have these um

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:04,320
graphical uh backgrounds so

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,080
these are really nice you already have a

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,000
lot a bunch of these made

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,080
so even if you feel like you can't do

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,240
this yourself you have templates for

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,440
this

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:18,080
and these these are some do's and don'ts

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,640
typography rules so i'm just gonna drop

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,640
the link

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,240
here

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:31,360
you can um go through this it's

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,760
really helpful and it helps to make sure

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,039
that

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:38,160
after you make a badge um so these

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:40,400
if you you do not adhere to it the the

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,240
mistakes you make they will be pointed

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,799
out by the design team member then you

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,080
you have to essentially do it again um

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,280
someone else will

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,039
so um it just helps you to save save

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,160
some time if you

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:58,720
stick to this right

00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:01,840
so if you go to the

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:05,039
i think i have the talks yeah okay

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,919
so here

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,840
are all the assets you will need so the

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,679
bad shapes the different templates you

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,520
can download it right here

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,720
the content templates the background

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,240
templates so

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,000
let's say you need a background but you

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,320
don't know how to make one you can just

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,159
download this svg right here and you

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,720
have a bunch of these templates

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,760
so all you have to do is just download

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,679
it save as

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:32,880
and then you can use it so

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,039
i mean there are a lot of resources if

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,000
you're aware you just use them it makes

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:40,559
making badges

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,320
really easy okay so

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,840
this is actually the tutorial content

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,280
from the previous workshop so this

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,760
workshop is actually

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,240
is a regular workshop that is conducted

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,520
by marie norton the fk

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,720
uh i flock so these are

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:59,760
these are the previous tutorial contents

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,240
and you have these graphics oh so if you

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,520
are

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:07,679
um worried about designing the artwork

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:11,120
i have never ever designed this guy ever

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:14,080
it's way too difficult i mean i just

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,720
use the old templates and kind of remix

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,960
it

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,880
like let's say if i want the sky but i

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,799
don't want the doctor

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:26,720
get up i'll just delete this and i have

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:28,400
the top half of a badger so

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,000
same for different graphics these are

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,960
the miscellaneous items you can use

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,760
so honestly there's a lot of stuff and

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,679
beyond this

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,679
you have the um

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:48,640
the badge index which you can use

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:51,760
i'm glad it's helping you out unhug so

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,360
the this um just i i think i have

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,120
dropped this before but i'm just dropped

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,640
another link for the

00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:02,480
docs uh page you can go through it

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,320
it's really super helpful i mean if you

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,000
i should not say this but if you were to

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,400
leave right now and

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,600
go through the docs i mean 80 percent of

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:15,039
the of your problems would be solved

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:18,640
but for the 20 percent let's just

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:22,080
please stick with me okay

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,600
so now the theory part is over

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,360
and now we'll go on to the actual

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,960
tutorial so

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:31,600
um what i do is i go through this slice

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,039
quickly just to give you an overview of

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,520
what we're going to do

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,200
and then we're going to start over we're

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,799
going to come back and we're going to do

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,640
each and everything together

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,840
so that everyone is on the same page and

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,120
if there are any troubles

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,159
any uh doubts you have we'll try to

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,679
clear those

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:51,679
so that we can start designing badges

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,360
right so the first thing of course we're

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,280
going to do is we are going to

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,400
download and install all the relevant

00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,320
resources

00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,799
this includes inkscape um the palette

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,400
the templates then we are going to

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,760
identify a ticket that needs

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,120
artwork then we we're going to do some

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,400
research

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:15,919
for the uh for the badge then

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,600
we are going to categorize that badge

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,679
and we're going to open download the

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,840
templates

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,840
we're going to decide the backgrounds

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,520
the patterns if we want and then we're

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,880
going to

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:34,480
work on the artwork so

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,039
then we'll try to see how we can make

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,120
the

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,799
different graphics that is used that are

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,919
used in the badges

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:45,840
and then we will post it

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:49,440
we will submit it for review okay

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:52,880
so this part of the workshop

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,000
is where you guys are going to have to

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,240
work

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,840
so the first thing i'm going to ask is

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,080
we're going to download

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,080
all the relevant resources so

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:10,960
if you oh thanks sayak i hope

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,880
everyone is on board yeah so

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,080
if you go to this link that i sent right

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,000
here

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:22,159
this one and if for those of you who

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,159
don't have inkscape you can go here

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,360
and you can download inkscape 1.0 this

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:32,559
is the latest release that just came out

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:36,400
uh you can choose your os here

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,400
and you can download it so

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:44,240
i let me just ask how wait

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:48,000
okay so how many of you

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:51,039
don't have instead installed

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,799
just just drop like a plus one or a

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:57,039
minus one

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,039
so that i can wait for you guys

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:04,799
oh do you have you do have inkscape

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,039
yeah you have it installed um

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,559
okay so if anyone else is installing it

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,799
just put it on in the background we'll

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:14,080
discuss a few more things

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:17,679
um okay so you have

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,440
it you haven't slept

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,799
okay so what we're going to do is we're

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,400
going to wait

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,400
a few minutes let's see

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:34,320
okay so um

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:37,200
this is the link right here you can just

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,080
for those of you who don't have it just

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,360
go here

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:45,279
and download it you'll set it up

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:47,520
um in case most of you do having skip

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,960
so we will move on to the next step if

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,840
someone is still installing

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,240
just let it be and you can catch up

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:58,480
you're not going to move very fast

00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:00,880
okay so the next thing is to do is to

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,880
download the palette so i covered this

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,799
in the previous session also

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,240
um so i'm going to quickly go through

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,480
this so

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,760
if you if you have just installed

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,799
inkscape or if you don't have the

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,200
palette

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,279
this is what it's going to look like

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,799
you're going to have the defaulting

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:21,840
palette it's but uh since we need

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:24,640
the badges to be uniform and

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,720
kind of look the same we have this

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,240
badges palette so that the colors are

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,240
somewhat similar

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,279
um this is not to say that you don't

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,240
need to stick to

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:36,880
these colors only um of course if the

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,799
artwork requires you can

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,480
you have the creative freedom to do so

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,320
just make sure that you

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,320
start with these colors if these colors

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:48,480
work that's great

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:52,159
right and to install this palette

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:56,640
all you have to do is

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:59,919
okay so this is a gpl file

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,480
a pilot file so these are the hex

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:05,520
codes these are the rgb codes

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:09,919
so to download this all you have to do

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:12,000
is save link as and then we have the gpl

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:15,760
file as you can see right here

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,039
and so this is the place that you need

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,600
to go to

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,480
uh you need to save it in this folder

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,600
inkscape

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,559
slash palettes so this is for windows so

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,320
this is the part

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:30,000
that i have users mira appdata roaming

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,120
inkscape palettes

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,720
so this is for windows if you have some

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:40,080

just search it and you will find

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,679
um where you have to install this

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,200
right and this is the extended color

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,000

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,559
let's see if anyone has anything

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,840
can you guys hear me now

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,760
oh okay i thought i lost connection

there

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,840
um did i

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,799
i can go over anything that i that um i

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,559
missed because i was talking

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,039
continuously for the first

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,880
uh five minutes okay so i'm just gonna

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,120
continue but yeah you can download the

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,520
palette

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,440
here and while you're at it install the

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,360
comforter typeface too

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,440
so any text or any numbering that you

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:43,360
have in the batch

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:45,279
we use comforter typeface for it so

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:49,520
you can just click this link and you can

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:53,760
download it so i already have it

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,760
yeah so

00:28:53,919 --> 00:29:00,080
shall we move on and let's see what's

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,080
the next step

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,640
so we have the enscape uh we have escape

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,080
we have palette

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,000
the template so we're going to of course

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,799
download the templates afterwards

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,720
when we have identified the batch that

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,960
we are going to design

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,679
so the next thing is to identify a

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,960
ticket that means artwork

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,520
so for this everyone is going to work on

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,559
their

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:30,080
own badges so

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,960
i have dropped the link right here and

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,080
um

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,840
what i need is since if this was uh in a

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,360
physical setting i would come over to

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,440
your

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,360
workstation to help you guys out in

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,880
selecting tickets but

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:48,240
can't do that so um

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:51,200
i'll share my screen um and if you guys

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,159
need any help deciding a ticket you can

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,159
um

00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,799
you can i think is a button somewhere

00:29:54,159 --> 00:30:00,240
here where you can um

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:01,360
select uh ask to join us to participate

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,080
something like that

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,720
and um if you then you can share your

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,799
screen

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,399
and then i can help you choose a ticket

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,520
if you are confused

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:13,679
otherwise i'm going to go through the

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:17,760
issues myself right now and this

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,760
will identify some good tickets together

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:23,840
okay so this is

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,200
hmm so

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,200
i would say this is this is something i

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,320
think

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,399
this is a good first issue um so

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,080
basically what this badge up is about is

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:41,360
you have to design a badge

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:44,720
for l10 and group members um

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,960
so basically this ticket if you look at

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,080
it

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,559
this describes uh like what the badge is

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,399
for

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,200
who is who is going to be getting these

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,080
badges and this person has also

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,039
suggested an

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:59,519
artwork like um what they wanted to be

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:02,480
like so that's great

00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:05,600
if someone is looking for an issue going

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,600
to drop this length

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,600
you can maybe work on this

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:19,039
so i think this will be a community

00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,679
batch right because this is a part of

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,519
the

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,200
community right so you can download the

00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:26,880
community template

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:29,919
um this one actually this one is

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,159
complete i have this so i am the

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,399
assignee here i have actually made the

00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,519
patch i did not have time to post it so

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,919
you can skip

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:43,120
this one this is also ready to push

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,120
hmm oh

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:49,760
i think this might be easy okay so

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,559
turning extra extra into a series so

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,640
this is really

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,320
easy i would say actually one of the

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,200
first badges that i designed was

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,159
actually turning

00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,559
an existing badge into a series so we

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,880
have this extra extra patch i really

00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:05,200
love the artwork for this one

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,200
um

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:13,279
okay so we have this badge right here

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,840
and so when we turn a badge into a

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:18,880
series what we do is we generally

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,600
um if you don't have any like if you are

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,640
if you don't have any creative idea what

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,919
you can do

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:29,760
is you can just add a numbering

00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:31,840
so um currently we have the extra extra

00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,399
batch for magazine contributors

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:37,519
so we we need additional badges for the

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:40,799
five article 10 article 25 article level

00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,799
so what you can do is we can just add

00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,840
one the number one somewhere right here

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,039
maybe you can

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:50,559
um sort of

00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:53,039
so reduce the size of this charger add

00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,080
the one here maybe somewhere that's for

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,399
you to figure out

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,240
and so basically when we want to convert

00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,519
a badge into a series what we do is we

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,799
add different numbers

00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,559
so we add 1 5 10 25.

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,320
so this indicates so this badge was

00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,399
awarded for

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,240
writing one article dispatch was awarded

00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:13,120
for writing five articles

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,320
so this is a good first issue um and if

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,279
you're working on it

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,799
you can okay so i don't have the take

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:22,640
button here

00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:24,720
if you guys have it then you can just

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,760
there's a take button right here and you

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,080
can click it

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,159
i am not sure why i don't have it um

00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,559
this has been a problem

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:35,039
uh i think you need to be a member of

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,760
the badges group on video or something

00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,720
like that

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,080
not really sure why i don't have it um

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,120
but this assignee is

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,240
so that two people don't work on the

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,600
same issue

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,679
um because we have a lot of different

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,840
issues to cover so i'm just going to

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:53,840
drop this link right here

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:56,320
and if you have decided on the

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,120
badge that you want to work on you can

00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,320
just

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,480
um maybe if you can use the if you have

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:06,000
the take button there

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:09,520
oh right yeah so if you have decided

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,919
an issue so just i guess right

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,200
um here in the chat box it says that

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,200
you're taking this issue

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,040
so that multiple people do not take up

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,159
the same issue

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:23,599
um but yeah if you do that

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:26,800
um i will talk to someone to see why we

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,800
don't have that take button

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,159
um but yeah so i think

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,520
i will do a couple of more so this is a

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,679
good first issue

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,399
um you can take this one it's labeled a

00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:43,839
good first issue

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:45,839
um so this is for the butter fs

00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,399
yeah so we were discussing this in a

00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:53,119
section earlier also

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:56,240
you can use the idea is butter

00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,440
you can go through the comments a lot of

00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:01,119
people have discussed

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,800
what they're looking for and

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,800
maybe people have suggested artwork

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,240
ideas also here so this is also a good

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,400
first issue

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,400
oh i think i should drop the link here

00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:18,000
could be i mean i remember that when i

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,359
started like

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,520
when i started uh contributing so marie

00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,160
would tell me that there is a pencil i

00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,240
can

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,079
under like right there and i've seen it

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,320
some people do have that pencil icon and

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:34,079
then they can just click on it edit

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:36,800
and um they can add tags they can assign

00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,760
the task to someone or to themselves

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,520
uh so i don't know i i do have that

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,880
pencil icon in some other

00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:47,599
picture repos i think it was euro

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:51,520
fedora or something but i don't know why

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:54,560
i do not have it in design or badges

00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,920
maybe maybe they're removing it but i

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,440
don't know how that would work since we

00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,079
need to edit

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,079
the tags

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,320
so i have no idea if someone is here

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,839
from the technical side

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,520
um maybe they could help us but

00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,680
honestly i don't know why we don't have

00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,760
that

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:16,480
yeah that's a great idea we can just you

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,480
can just comment on the ticket itself

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,520
and here also so that other people who

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,599
are here

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,599
can we choose a different one

00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,880
okay so i think i have

00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:34,160
chosen i guess i have a couple of i've

00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,760
given you guys a couple of different

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,359
tickets that you can work on

00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,200
or if you don't like any of these you

00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:42,400
can just

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,960
use the filter um artwork needs

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,200
improvement

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,359
is generally easy because you already

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,280
have the artwork

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,280
and well it depends on the category also

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,040
sometimes the

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,280
artwork needs improvement means you have

00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,240
to start the offer from scratch

00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,480
um i think this one might be complete

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,480
though

00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,000
let's see you have a lot of comments

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,839
here so you will have lots and lots of

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,839
resources and

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,119
i think this one is not yeah okay so you

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,599
can use this one

00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,680
because as you can see um this is

00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:25,359
touching the ring the artwork is

00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,440
quite like outside the background so

00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,560
this one needs a couple of quick

00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,480
adjustments

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,839
if you if you match it through the style

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,720
car you will see that there are a couple

00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,920
of things

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,680
that need to be fixed here and that

00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,040
makes for a good first issue

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,119
because you already have all of this

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,960
artwork you just need to

00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,960
um spruce it up so to say

00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:51,520
so i'll drop the link for this one and

00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:55,680
then we can move on

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,680
right so what is the next step

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:04,400
research oh this is honestly

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:07,839
my favorite part i mean

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,400
because we have once you have decided or

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,920
ticket for yourself the first thing you

00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,520
you should do is you should look at

00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,160
similar badges

00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,480
uh because a you can get a lot of

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,520
artwork from there so you can remix that

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,760
artwork

00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,760
b if you don't have any i your

00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,560
inspiration

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,359
that like similar those badges will help

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,079
you out

00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,359
so it helps you choose a concept for

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,320
your patch also

00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:35,520
so for gathering inspirations you can go

00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,359
to

00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,880
you can go to the earlier badges you can

00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:42,160
go to the docs

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,720
you'll find a lot of artwork there

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,280
um these are the graphics the or you can

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,839
just

00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,119
so if you have the concept you can just

00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,880
google

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,880
and or maybe any search engine that

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,320
you're using just look it up so if

00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,320
someone were to say

00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,160
designing a batch that required a

00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,400
bicycle and if you're making it from

00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,920
scratch so you might need a reference

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:06,400
so you can just google references

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,040
and of course existing badges i mean i

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,240
think

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:13,040
this one is the most important resource

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,599
because honestly i don't think i've like

00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,599
ever

00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:19,680
i think i made once um

00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,640
an artwork from scratch and it was not

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,839
very good

00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:29,839
so you just

00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:29,839
go to fedora badges and

00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,480
let's see i remember one of the badges

00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,480
was about

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,480
the l 10 n group so if someone is a

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,520
member of the alternate group they get

00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,400
the badge

00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,800
so what you can do is you can look at

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,160
what

00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:51,920
other groups have their badges so

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:54,320
um it also helps you categorize so

00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,760
i think this was this is uh one of the

00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,280
top few tickets

00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:02,640
on the repo and it's about uh so

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,359
they need a badge for someone who is in

00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,839
the l-10

00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,119
group and there are a couple of

00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,160
different matches like that for

00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,040
different groups so this

00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,960
is the uh badge that you get if you are

00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,800
a member of the design team

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,240
so you can see like we have this ninja

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,160
and this paint brush

00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:23,520
so you see how that works um

00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:25,920
this is the um comb ops team

00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,280
this is the security team and this is

00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,319
pretty great

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:33,119
and um this is the

00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:34,400
uh this is the sysadmin main team so you

00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:38,000
can see if you

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:40,240
you will probably find um inspiration i

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,440
remember the l10 and bat already had an

00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,880
artwork idea

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,160
so um you can probably use some of these

00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,240
artworks so you can

00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:52,240
uh let me just open that one

00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,599
is it okay if the ninjas paintbrush

00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,800
pokes out of the ring it is

00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,720
actually not all the time though uh i

00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,200
mean

00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:03,200
stylistically yeah it looks good right

00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,200
it pokes out a lot of badges actually

00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,560
has have like this

00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:11,520
but it sort of goes over the uh

00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,800
ring but it's not something that is that

00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,000
you're supposed to do

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:21,280
all the time or if it sort of mars

00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:24,800
the actual artwork i mean honestly um

00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:28,000
not all of these badges are

00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,760
uh adhered to the style guide um some of

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,839
these badges are actually from even

00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,960
before the style guide was

00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:37,119
made so that's why we try to stick to

00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,680
the site right so that we don't

00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,359
end up deviating more so if you see this

00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,839
is pretty creative right i mean they

00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,720
broke

00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:46,640
the ring it's pretty creative so if you

00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,280
have a concept like this it's okay to do

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,920
this

00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,920
or once in a while it's not a problem

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,359
yeah i hope i answered your question um

00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,800
but most of them often it's better to

00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,960
stick inside

00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,079
actually this badge was designed by

00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,520
marie

00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:08,960
and i i i trust her uh

00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:12,560
she knows what she's doing so um if she

00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,000
if she uh if she has the badge out of

00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,119
the ring

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,240
i guess that works so

00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,880
yeah i guess when it well it's only a

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,880
small

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,800
part if you see that this is the just

00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,760
the umbrella kind of gives the

00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,160
um effect that that thing is poking out

00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,480
right

00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,599
you can see the flag it's sort of on the

00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,520
ring so i guess it's

00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,520
the sort of effect that you're going for

00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:41,200
yeah okay so

00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,520
um let me just give you an example of

00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,760
how

00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,560
um i work if i was working on a badge so

00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,599
what i would do

00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,880
is so they have an artwork suggestion

00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:58,079
right here

00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,240
so i'm going to google what an error top

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,240
is

00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:10,800
okay okay so this garb right here

00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,800
okay so this is an arrow so now i know

00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,839
and holding a calligraphy pill so what

00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,960
does the calligraphy can look like

00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,800
i mean i know there are a couple of

00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,839
different versions but what's the most

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,839
recognized one

00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:30,880
well i can see 10 different options here

00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:34,400
i think this one would be the way to go

00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,400
as you can see this is a pretty

00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,240
recognizable shape i would say something

00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,000
that you can actually mimic easily in

00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,800
inkscape too

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,520
um yeah so that is the first thing you

00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,200
do you

00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:49,440
do your research and um

00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,560
okay so i know that there is a badge

00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,319
that has a guy

00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:57,599
a panda writing on a desk

00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:57,599
let's see if i can find it

00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,000
use this eye this one right here so

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,480
maybe

00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,240
something like this maybe i just need to

00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,000
draw the upper half of the eye maybe i

00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:13,119
can just reuse this

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,480
add the top here and

00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:20,800
turn this pencil into a calligraphy pen

00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:25,040
and remove the flag maybe

00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,040
that is an idea so

00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:34,319
that is actually true um

00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:37,359
that's i agree with sayoc uh

00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:38,880
it would make it too specific to it

00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:40,800
would make it to arabic when the

00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,640
localization team they don't just do

00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,280
arabic translations they do translations

00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,640
from

00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,880
like they do i 72 different languages i

00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,000
remember last amateur they had like over

00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,760
70 or

00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,920
80 languages that they translate so

00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,040
you could maybe uh look up existing

00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,040
elton badges

00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:09,280
i know there was a

00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,319
match that i designed okay so an

00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,440
important part of

00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:16,319
the uh research is also

00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,160
looking up the thick so right now we are

00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,960
designing it for the alternating group

00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,640
right

00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:25,040
um so for those of you who don't know

00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,240
the electronic group is the localization

00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,800
group

00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,480
and i know this because i did some

00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,800
research on this because i was making a

00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,040
graphic for them uh before that i did

00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:39,440
not know what localization was

00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:41,359
so um you can actually google

00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,520
what i would do is i would just google

00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:46,560
and return in

00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:49,359
europe for the best

00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,079
i have the project everything here so

00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:52,319
just

00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:54,000
go through it look at what they do if

00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:56,160
they have some existing artwork that

00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,400
they have used

00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,400
uh

00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:06,240
so i'm just trying to look up

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,480
their pejor i don't think they have

00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,480
their

00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:16,240
i designed some artwork okay let's see

00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:18,480
so i designed some artworks uh of

00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,480
an infographic that is currently under

00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,720
review

00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,119
for the italian team and let's see if

00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,119
that

00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:30,400
helps okay

00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:38,079
i hope i'm not deviating

00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,079
oh let's see

00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:45,599
i see oh so you can use an art so

00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:48,880
like you can try to make uh an earth

00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:54,160
thingy um as

00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:54,160
graphic so this is the

00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,920
this is the infographic that i made for

00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,839
the alternate team so

00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,599
they did not have a lot of graphics so i

00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:04,720
made this because they do

00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:07,680
like a lot of different translations

00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,599
and i think the globalization team would

00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,680
also have a couple of different graphics

00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:15,280
that could be relevant here the internet

00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,280
internal nationalization one

00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,720
i did not know one week before i

00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,800
designed this i

00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,359
knew nothing about localization or

00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:29,359
internet internationalization

00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:32,960
so you could maybe

00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:35,040
you know like do something you know this

00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,359
is honestly relevant here

00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,040
let's just skip that but yeah so i

00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:41,599
designed this from scratch i

00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,319
i read up on a research what the group

00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:46,319
does

00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:50,160
so they do translations and maybe

00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:53,280
you could maybe one could use this

00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:56,079
or something like that maybe

00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,720
uh so these are just you can always

00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,760
discuss the ideas in the telegram group

00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:04,960
or on irc

00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,960
the fedora badges let me see

00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,880
if anyone is interested in doing the

00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,920
fedora badges

00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:16,079
telegram group and then

00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:19,359
if telephone decides to open that is

00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:24,160
hmm okay there we go

00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:24,160
so this is the badges group

00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:32,960
so this is the if you want to discuss

00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:38,559
possible advocate something

00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:38,559
we can join this group

00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,160
anyway so

00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:49,200
i hope everyone has an idea of

00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,040
what i mean when you say research so

00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,119
it's not just

00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:55,040
researching existing artworks is also

00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:58,400
researching what the badge is about

00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,839
and why are we creating like why do we

00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,160
need that badge so

00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:04,000
that actually helps you give your badge

00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:07,440
a sense of direction

00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:10,079
um i'll give a small example

00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,000
and then we'll move on um that is

00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,839
actually a really good example so when i

00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,960
first started

00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:21,280
uh let's see when i first started uh

00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,040
when i was designing badges i think

00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,640
three four months ago

00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:28,400
um there was this badge i would just

00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:32,079
open

00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,079
um let's see if

00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,559
i don't think i'll find it there are a

00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:45,119
lot of different badges here

00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:48,800
um i know what

00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:51,119
search so okay so there was this badge

00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,119
um

00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,280
so there was this badge that was needed

00:49:55,119 --> 00:50:01,839
for closing picture issues

00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:04,319
so um i did not know what to do and

00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:06,800
if you see the kind of art book i made i

00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:10,400
mean it's cringe honestly

00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,800
i like it now um so i'm just going to

00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,040
show

00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,160
that you know sometimes it after a

00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:18,400
little bit like

00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,400
everyone starts out here so

00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,480
they have an idea a panda sitting and

00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,119
looking at a piece of paper with files

00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,800
on one side

00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:26,720
a trash can on the other and scattered

00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:29,760
papers around it

00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:32,240
um this was my version

00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,119
and if you compare it to the style guide

00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,160
it's not

00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:37,440
um there it's not it does

00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:40,400
there are a lot of different mistakes

00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:44,000
that i see right now uh this panda looks

00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:47,119
so weird um but yeah

00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:50,000
so after marie

00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,599
reviewed it so this is what she did she

00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,520
said

00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,640
i just looked up edgier and it means

00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,960
hermit crab

00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,240
what about a cartoon looking hermit crab

00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,079
on the beach

00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,640
i did not know that i did not do enough

00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:05,760
research if i done enough research i

00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:08,559
would have found out and maybe then

00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,520
yeah so this is after she suggested this

00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:22,240
idea

00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:26,160
this is what we did so

00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:28,160
oh yeah i remember this

00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,520
but the thing is uh this is a good

00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:32,240
concept

00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:34,640
um but make sure that when you are kind

00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:36,640
of like you can't really use it as it is

00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,920
um because when you compare it with the

00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,359
style guide

00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,960
there are a lot of things that need to

00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:44,160
be adjusted needs to

00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,280
have a little stroke here a darker green

00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,800
stroke

00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:50,319
and yeah so when you're using this you

00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:54,480
can use this concept

00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:56,160
and apply the style guide to it and then

00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,599
i think this would make a pretty good

00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,480
badge

00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:02,480
so you can use a globe icon yes exactly

00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,240
it's a source of inspiration

00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,760
and it's really nice one too it's just

00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,599
make sure that you don't have too much

00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,480
going on because the patches are really

00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:10,640
small

00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,240
so we have a really small area so make

00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,680
sure it's not really complicated because

00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:15,839
if

00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:18,000
um even though this is a source of

00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:20,319
inspiration let's say someone decided to

00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
use this exact artwork and you know

00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:25,280
modify it and use this

00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,720
if it was very small which badges

00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:30,160
usually are

00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:33,760
this is what it will look like and

00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:35,920
well nothing makes sense here does it

00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,599
but that is another point that we have

00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,880
to take care of instead there is not too

00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:42,319
much going on

00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,880
um keep it simple that's what i would

00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,559
say

00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,960
because it's a really small space that

00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:49,040
you're working with and generally people

00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:52,319
view badges on mobile

00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,319
so it's even smaller

00:52:53,520 --> 00:53:00,160
okay so i guess it's time to move on

00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:02,480
just going to close some of these

00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,079
patches

00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,240
this one this is the first artwork i

00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:08,480
made from scratch i was

00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,559
honestly very intimidated but if you

00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,040
look at it it's just a bunch of shapes

00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:14,720
that i

00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:18,880
kind of join together so

00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:22,160
yeah i was pretty proud of it then

00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:25,119
the keyword being then um

00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,680
i can definitely improve it now but yeah

00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,480
that's why

00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:30,559
what i mean is we all got to start

00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:33,839
somewhere right

00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:36,880
okay so

00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:40,480
the next thing is

00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:42,559
categorization so um

00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,319
you can use this style guide to

00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:47,839
categorize your badge

00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:49,440
um so we have different categories here

00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:51,359
and if you have any trouble you can

00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,079
always ask on the ticket itself you can

00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:53,920
comment the

00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:56,000
person open the ticket will be able to

00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:59,200
help you or someone from the design team

00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:02,420
will be able to help you out or um

00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,839
you can just ask on the telegram group

00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:05,040
[Music]

00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:07,599
and then you can download the

00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:10,640
corresponding template so if you have a

00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:13,280
community badge so you can just download

00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:16,319
the community template

00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:18,400
and this is the svg file right here so

00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:22,720
you will get this

00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:24,559
just right click save as

00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:28,319
and then you can save it you can rename

00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:28,319
it and then open it on inkscape

00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,359
so if you have decided a badge and

00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,440
you're able to

00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:36,720
find the category for it you can

00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,960
download a template

00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,640
if you need any help maybe you can drop

00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,880
your technique right here

00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:44,480
and if you don't if you're not able to

00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:48,079
decide the

00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,079
category we can do that together

00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:55,520
okay so the next thing is the background

00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,280
so if you look at the style guide the

00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,799
style light suggests

00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,319
some different color backgrounds for

00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:04,240
different categories

00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:07,040
so we discussed this before

00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:08,480
uh when i first was discussing the style

00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:12,000
guide

00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:15,440
right i think a pretty good example is

00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,359
ah okay yeah

00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,720
the pretty good example is this as you

00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:22,240
can see

00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:24,240
the development category so for comics

00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:27,040
we have a pink background for 4g

00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,880
there is a live background for so

00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:33,040
basically there is a sort of

00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:37,760
um a very i would say soft guidelines

00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:41,760
um to follow and what happens is

00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,760
if you follow these guidelines

00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,280
i'll show you it looks really pretty

00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:49,839
because then all the badges are very

00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,839
uniform

00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:56,000
right so if you see there is a sort of

00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:58,319
theme going on around here

00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,319
um

00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,200
so the development badges are kind of

00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:06,640
they have a very

00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:09,359
similar aesthetic right so these are all

00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,280
like pale colors in the background

00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:14,160
the community colors are much more

00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,160
brighter and

00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:20,559
louder

00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:22,319
so of course you can always if if the

00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:25,920
artwork that you're making

00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:26,559
requires it to go out of the style guide

00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,319
a bit

00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:30,240
a little bit of creative freedom is

00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:32,559
always there like this one for example

00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:35,920
this has a pretty elaborate background

00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:38,799
um so it stands out a little

00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,160
but yeah i mean if you are doing

00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:43,040
something that fits in here

00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,079
go ahead if you have a good idea if you

00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,400
want to be creative

00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:48,000
you can always go display but this is a

00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,640
good place to start if you don't know

00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,640
where to start

00:56:51,599 --> 00:57:01,280
okay so the next thing is

00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:04,000
right you can select the color from the

00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:07,440
fedora and badges palette so

00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:11,760
um let's open a badge

00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:13,839
right hmm let's see what all badges i

00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,839
have

00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:26,240
honestly i don't know which one to open

00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:29,359
um okay

00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:31,680
should i okay let's do this one

00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:32,480
so this is the fashion i'm i worked on

00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,960
recently

00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,079
um this is the badge for disney for

00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,960
someone who contributes to

00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:40,400
zine they'll get this match um and there

00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,040
are a couple of different problems with

00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,880
it

00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:46,000
so this ring needs to be blue so since i

00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,799
have the

00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,280
um palette here i can just easily select

00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,720
this

00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:56,000
oh i will yeah

00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:57,839
so if oh um so this is the stroke

00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,119
right and if you want to change the

00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:01,119
color of the stroke

00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:03,040
just press shift and then click the

00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:05,599
color so if i press shift

00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:07,920
it's going to change the stroke and if i

00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:09,119
do not press shift and just simply click

00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,920
on it it's going to

00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,960
set the fill so that's something i found

00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,960
out really

00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,319
later on and it's sort of helped me a

00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,720
lot

00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:20,319
so yeah uh you can see the shadow is

00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,040
also a little messed up it's supposed to

00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:23,119
be down

00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,319
it's supposed to be on the bottom i

00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:26,400
don't know i think i messed up the

00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:28,559
template so i have to do this again

00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,799
but yeah and if you look at the pattern

00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:31,440
um that's not something that we usually

00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:33,520
do

00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,640
uh so this pattern is actually a pattern

00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,880
from the z itself

00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,839
and i use that here because it makes

00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,040
sense here right

00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:43,200
this artwork also is not something like

00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,559
this is a hand-drawn illustration

00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,400
so this is not something that you'll

00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:48,319
find in other badges but

00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,079
since the zine is supposed to be a

00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:52,799
hand-drawn magazine

00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:53,440
um it has that aesthetic it fits in

00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,040
there

00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,440
right so a little bit of creative

00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:00,880
freedom is um your

00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:05,839
you can always be creative

00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,839
right so

00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:12,240
let's see okay so this is the most

00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:15,520
important part i would say is save

00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:16,640
um because in script escape sometimes

00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,040
crashes okay

00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,839
especially the if you have updated to

00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:24,240
the latest

00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:25,440
one it crashes and i've lost a lot of

00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,920
work because of it

00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,040
so this is something i say from personal

00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,319
experience

00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:34,799
please keep on saving your work and also

00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:36,880
i learned yesterday that you can

00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:40,960
actually set up auto save

00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:45,760
on your landscape so it's

00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:47,440
somewhere in the preferences

00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,880
i don't exactly know where it is i

00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,280
remember someone said you can find it in

00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,160
the

00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,160
preferences

00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:57,760
you can maybe if someone knows they can

00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,760
help me out

00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:01,200
but somewhere here you can oh auto save

01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,200
there we go

01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,319
so you can actually set the interview

01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:08,400
interval here

01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:11,440
and you don't have to worry about

01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,880
losing your work so that's really

01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,480
helpful for those of you who have worked

01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,480
on instead you know

01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,839
how much frustrating it is when it stops

01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,319
working and

01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:22,880
crashes otherwise it's a pretty great

01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:27,520
tool to use

01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:29,839
so yeah the next thing we have

01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,839
is

01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:37,040
okay so the background can vary

01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:39,760
depending on the concept

01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:41,040
so you can either draw your own

01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,200
background you can

01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:46,079
maybe do a graphical illustration or you

01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:50,000
can import it from an existing badge

01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:54,160
or maybe you can use gradients so

01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,160
um if you want to use gradients

01:00:54,559 --> 01:01:04,640
let's see okay so this is the gradient

01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:04,640
thing wait i have atom fill

01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:14,559
um this is actually a png image so it's

01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:17,119
not going to work on this one

01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:17,920
but if you have a badge open you can

01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:21,520
let's

01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:23,760
open another one this is one of the

01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:25,119
earlier concepts so you work a lot right

01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:27,680
i mean

01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:29,200
you can make different iterations and

01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,960
come back to them and see how you feel

01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,559
about them like i do not feel good about

01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:35,920
this right now

01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:39,119
um but yeah so you can

01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:42,720
change the color you can

01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:45,359
go to the fill option you can add a

01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:48,319
gradient

01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:49,200
experiment a bit see what works what

01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:51,760
doesn't

01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,559
you can maybe add a pattern on top of it

01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,640
okay so

01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:58,000
to align the pattern you can use the

01:01:54,640 --> 01:02:01,200
align and distribute tool

01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,799
so i have selected the two objects and

01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:05,039
then i'm going to align them

01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:07,200
so just make sure that you don't you

01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:10,720
know it's aligned perfectly

01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:13,359
and looks good so and just

01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,359
keep saving

01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:19,599
okay so if you have any doubts anything

01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,039
to do with inkscape or maybe badges you

01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:22,960
can drop them here

01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:24,960
i am checking it or if you maybe you

01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:26,000
want to share your screen and ask

01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:29,200
something

01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,559
um you can request i think there is

01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:33,920
something right there

01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:35,839
um right where it says leave for me i

01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:40,000
think it says join for you

01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:40,000
so you could do that

01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:46,319
anyway let's move on align and

01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:46,640
distribute is a great tool to use and if

01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:48,640
you

01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:50,960
are working with badges you may you need

01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:53,359
to make sure that everything is lined up

01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,640
so it's going to come in really handy

01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:56,000
okay so this is the

01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,440
this this is the thing that you're going

01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,880
to use the most is when you're going to

01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:02,240
download artwork

01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:03,839
right so as i showed you there are svg

01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,760
files on the tickets and you can

01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:09,440
download these svg files these are the

01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:12,400
png's but the pngs are not editable

01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:14,559
so you can download the svgs

01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:17,280
occasionally what will happen is you

01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:20,720
will encounter an older file

01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:23,200
so after it was migrated like after the

01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:26,880
system i created from fedora hosted

01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:28,720
uh there was an error and there are some

01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,160
files that if you click on them this is

01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:33,359
what you're going to

01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:36,559
find and this is what happens in

01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:40,079
the earlier patches i will try to

01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:40,960
see if i can oh i'm trying to figure out

01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,720
why i can't

01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:44,240
i can't get the extended palette to work

01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,839
for me

01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,280
maybe you can share your screen or you

01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:48,880
can describe the problem that you're

01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:51,119
having and we can troubleshoot it right

01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,119
now

01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:56,319
okay so you can if you want to share

01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:59,839
your screen you can

01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:59,839
okay there we go

01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,920
um okay

01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:13,839
okay

01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:27,839
yeah so i have the fedora rgb

01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:31,039
uh palette working but

01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:34,960
and i also kind of i don't know

01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:37,039
okay i also downloaded uh the

01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:38,240
extended palette but i can't find it

01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:41,520
okay

01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:45,839
so um did you

01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:47,839
uh put it in the correct work parts

01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:49,839
yeah did you restarting skip have you

01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:54,160
tried restarting it

01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:56,640
i actually did not that's

01:04:54,160 --> 01:05:00,000
i think the first rule of i.t is try

01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:02,880
turning it off and on again

01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,280
you really don't know that but yeah no

01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,720
no

01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:08,640
trust me the things i have done even i

01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,839
did not know like where i was going

01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:13,599
wrong with the palette

01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:16,559
ah i got it so yeah yeah yeah

01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:18,079
great so if anyone else is having the

01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:19,520
same trouble you can maybe just try

01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:23,119
restarting it

01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:26,400
yeah and i just got it uh on

01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:30,079
the pilot vessel so i think it's

01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:30,400
this one yeah so this is the extended

01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:34,240
one

01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,240
right this is the normal one right

01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:38,720
wait i i got actually i'm trying to look

01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:42,720
it's very tiny so

01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:45,440
um yeah okay yeah this is the normal one

01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:47,359
yeah i maximize your skin so this is the

01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,720
basic one and then you have the extended

01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:53,119
palette

01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:55,760
okay sure thanks great no problem

01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:55,760
oops sorry

01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:05,510
okay so i'm gonna start sharing my

01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:07,680
screen again

01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:09,760
[Music]

01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:12,319
which one oh i'm just going to share my

01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,319
ice cream

01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:24,319
there we go okay so

01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:26,640
where are we it's going to close i have

01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:30,240
so many tabs open

01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:32,240
okay right i was showing you that you

01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:35,359
might encounter some broken links

01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:39,520
so i'm going to go to the picture

01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:39,520
the badges repo and

01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:43,280
yeah so

01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,400
so while the newer issues so now we are

01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:51,520
in the 700s

01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:55,440
but there are

01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:55,440
issues that are like

01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:01,839
let's start by last modified date

01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:08,799
yeah so the earlier uh badges i think

01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:12,839
you might find though so this is six

01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:14,400
years ago so that's a long time so i

01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:17,359
think

01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,359
hmm let's see

01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:20,559
um

01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:28,799
right so you might find this like if you

01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:30,880
see a lot of this just ignore that and

01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:32,480
scroll and scroll and you'll find a lot

01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,880
of duplicate comments so

01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:36,160
uh these comments are on the older

01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,480
tickets you'll find that the comments

01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:40,240
are

01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:41,680
duplicate so if you click this one

01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:44,160
this is what's going to happen you'll

01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:47,280
get a 404 error so if you want to

01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:50,960
fix this all you have to do is

01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:55,039
take out the files and a backslash

01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:56,720
press enter and you can download it

01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:58,640
so i actually did not figure this out

01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:02,000
for a really long time

01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:04,880
um but yeah the the older

01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,480
badges will have this problem and you

01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:09,359
will also encounter

01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:11,200
if so you have to like took off here you

01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:15,440
have duplicates right

01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:15,440
so if you click the other one

01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:21,759
you get this i find this even more

01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,759
scarier than a 404 error

01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:25,839
so

01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:32,880
yeah so you can fix it by replacing

01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:35,759
this part of the url

01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,880
by this so i actually have not tried

01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:39,199
this one ever

01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,400
i would just go to the other one i

01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:43,440
thought this was

01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:48,319
not fixable let's see i'm supposed to

01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:48,319
delete this let's see if this works

01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:58,000
so yeah so this is a known issue

01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:58,000
and we have a fix for this

01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:03,120
so all you have to do is either delete

01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:06,319
the files and about slash

01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:09,359
or you change this part

01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:13,759
with this part okay

01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:17,040
so if you're talking about graphics

01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:19,440
you can draw from scratch um

01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:20,560
or you can import graphics you can use

01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:23,440
other graphics as

01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:25,759
it is rather i mean bad graphics from

01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:28,080
other badges or you can reuse them and

01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:29,920
sort of change the colors you can use

01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,440
a lot of different graphics together you

01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:35,839
can remix them

01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:39,040
so um maybe i wanted a

01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:40,880
panda sitting in a chair and but i did

01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:43,920
not want the lemonade glass so i can if

01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:45,440
i have the svg i can just delete this

01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,199
just make sure that you evaluate your

01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:50,319
design with this tag right

01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:52,640
something which i have not done here

01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:53,520
so while i did try to stick to the

01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,840
design

01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:57,600
guide i know that this stroke needs to

01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:00,880
be a bit more heavier

01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:03,520
um maybe some color

01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:04,239
here like some stroke in the background

01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:06,320
but this

01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:08,000
so okay so what i wanted to show here

01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:10,159
was this style was

01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,120
actually inspired from this batch so i

01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:14,719
picked up the

01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:18,400
sand and the sky deleted the ocean

01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:20,239
made this little guy and

01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:22,400
we have this i mean this is not a final

01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:26,000
badge this needs a lot of work

01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:28,159
but that's how you that's how i go about

01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,159
it

01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:33,280
so

01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:36,560
yeah i mean as i said before the ex the

01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:39,920
badges index is a really great tool uh

01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,560
if i not work i mean i've stolen a lot

01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:43,040
of

01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,400
graphics from there and reuse them remix

01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:49,920
them

01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:53,440
so yeah let's see if we have any

01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:54,080
doubts no okay so if anyone needs to ask

01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:57,440
something

01:10:54,080 --> 01:11:01,600
again you can ask it right there

01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:05,199
and i'm going to discuss the final part

01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:08,159
of making a badge and

01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:08,560
that is exporting it and this is the

01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:12,000
most

01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:13,840
important part of any badge because even

01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,520
if you did everything right here if you

01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:19,840
do not export it correctly

01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:21,679
you could end up with a badge that needs

01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:25,120
to be moved on

01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:26,000
so the thing is in inkscape those who

01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,920
are not familiar

01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,560
there are a couple of different export

01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:33,199
options so when you export it as a png

01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,400
you have page drawing selection and

01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:37,600
custom

01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:40,960
so what happens is page page means

01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:42,159
this area right here this canvas so this

01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:45,440
is the page

01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:47,280
and um if you

01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:49,120
export it using a page which is what

01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:51,440
you're supposed to do you will see

01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:52,719
that the width and the height of the

01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:55,440
batch is 256

01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:56,159
to 56. and that is what's supposed to

01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:59,760
happen

01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:02,880
like you need it to be 256.256 otherwise

01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:04,719
it's messed up on the screen so

01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:06,560
by default when you're exporting an

01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:08,880
image it's actually drawing

01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:10,800
and i have done this mystery so many

01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,000
times that i exported it as a drawing

01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,560
and i had to

01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,320
export it again it just takes i mean

01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:17,920
it's not a very big deal you just export

01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:20,560
it again but the thing is

01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:23,120
um it takes a couple of days for someone

01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:24,640
to point out that mistake

01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:27,199
it's the whole thing so just make sure

01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:29,920
that you're exporting it correctly

01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:31,360
so what what they mean by drawing is

01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:33,840
that they're going to export

01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:35,679
everything that is here like all the

01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:38,640
stuff that you have drawn

01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:40,400
so you're going to if i export it right

01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:42,159
now as a png

01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:45,360
this is what's going to be there in the

01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:48,080
png and even if you don't have anything

01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:49,600
on the screen beyond your badge even if

01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:52,080
you export it as a drawing what it's

01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:55,360
going to do is going to export only this

01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:58,640
area like this outering area

01:12:55,360 --> 01:13:01,920
this is 242 by 242 pixels

01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:03,840
so you don't need that um because

01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:06,640
the thing is you again you need it to be

01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:09,760
256 by 256

01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:13,520
at 90 dpi so make sure

01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:15,440
uh you have the settings correct

01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,800
but yeah just make sure you export it

01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:18,640
correctly

01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:21,280
uh you can change your export settings

01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:22,560
here you can change the folder rename it

01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,600
and after that make sure you click

01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:26,239
export

01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,520
which i don't do a lot of times i forget

01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:33,360
to click export

01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:36,400
that's when it actually exposes the png

01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,400
sorry about that

01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:44,400
oh oh i did not see that oh

01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:46,239
glad i cleared that off so even i did

01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:50,480
not know that i remember when i started

01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:51,040
um designing i just read somewhere i saw

01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:53,679
the people

01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:55,199
they were doing the same mistake and um

01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,840
someone from the design team would point

01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:58,000
it out and

01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:00,159
i actually i was like okay so export it

01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,560
as a page export it as a page so

01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:04,159
instead of understanding why i just kind

01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:06,800
of memorized it

01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:08,719
um and i would often get confused was it

01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:11,600
page or was it dry

01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:12,560
but yeah now i know so selection is um

01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:16,320
in that same

01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:19,120
manner selection is this area

01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:20,960
so if i select this and just export this

01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:23,199
so this is the area that's going to be

01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:26,000
exported so everything inside this

01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:28,640
rectangle and well custom as the name

01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,960
suggests you can um

01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:33,520
type in your own area your own custom

01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:42,239
area and that portion of the whole

01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:44,560
can like the whole file will be exported

01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:45,840
okay so i'm glad that helped you out

01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:48,640
edward

01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:50,640
and sylvia if you have any other doubts

01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:53,679
please feel free to ask them we

01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:55,679
do have another half an hour and

01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:57,679
honestly i'm done with my presentation

01:14:55,679 --> 01:15:00,480
so it's all you guys know

01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:02,480
so i would love to see if you have

01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:04,719
worked on something i would love to see

01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:06,960
and help you if you're stuck somewhere

01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:10,159
maybe

01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:13,280
okay so the last step in this process is

01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:16,960
after you have

01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:20,800
a draft of the badge you need to post it

01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:24,320
so you need to publish it on the ticket

01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:26,800
so if you

01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:29,600
this is going to give you a small demo

01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:32,159
how it works how you

01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:33,679
add graphics to pager if someone is not

01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:37,199
familiar

01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:38,960
so this is the badge

01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:41,280
so what you have to do is you enter your

01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:42,239
comment maybe if you have any questions

01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,679
or if you have

01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:45,840
if you want to point out something in

01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:49,520
your design you can type it

01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:52,239
and just browse

01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:54,960
and make sure that you upload the svg

01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:57,440
and the png both

01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:58,719
so the reason we do that is sometimes

01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:01,040
what happens is

01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:03,600
you may not be able to complete a design

01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:05,679
and if you post this svg here

01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:07,920
you can always someone else can always

01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:10,159
pick it up and continue working on it

01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:11,760
and that makes sure that your work is

01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:14,719
not wasted

01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,040
so always make sure that you come you

01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:18,000
have

01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:18,880
both the svg on the png the png is

01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,520
important

01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:26,159
because um as far as i know

01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:26,719
i may not be 100 correct but the png is

01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:29,440
the

01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:30,080
thing that is pushed to the repo so so

01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,920
that you have

01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:33,199
the badges that you actually see are

01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,120
pngs

01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:36,400
so it's that's why it's important to

01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:39,199
have

01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,840
the png and people can actually if you

01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:42,560
don't if

01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:43,679
someone does not have a graphic editor i

01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,320
can escape

01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:46,719
or they don't know how to view svg files

01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:50,480
uh

01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:53,600
pngs load in your browser so they can

01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:56,480
uh review your design in the browser

01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:57,520
so that's why when you're doing any

01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:59,920
design not just

01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:01,520
in federal badges if it's in uh fedora

01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:05,199
design also make sure that you upload

01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:05,199
the svg and the png

01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:15,199
yes okay i was right i i kind of assumed

01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:17,360
because that's why

01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:20,640
we are sticklers for making sure that

01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:23,840
the svg is 256. sorry the png is 256 by

01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,840
256 pixels

01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:29,920
okay so after you do that you can

01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:31,760
someone from the design team will review

01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:34,400
your work um

01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:35,760
you can always drop the link in the

01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:39,120
badges

01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:43,280
group on telegram or an irc

01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:49,679
and someone will review it

01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:49,679
so that's all from my side um

01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:53,760
or did something happen to my imaging

01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:58,000
voice

01:17:53,760 --> 01:18:03,199
did it disappear

01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:03,199
um sorry i have crappy internet

01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:16,000
um um

01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:18,800
i can wait maybe try leaving

01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,360
um joining again if it doesn't fix

01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:22,560
itself

01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:24,400
in a minute or two is it lagging

01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:26,000
could be that it's lagging a lot if

01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:27,440
someone else could also confirm what's

01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:31,920
happening

01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:35,920
oh okay um so maybe sylvia you could try

01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:35,920
refreshing uh

01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:39,760
if it doesn't work for you maybe you

01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:42,560
could try refreshing and see i think

01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,560
that will help you

01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:50,400
and yeah okay great

01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:52,480
so does anyone want to share if they

01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:55,840
have done something or if they are

01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:55,840
working with something

01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,960
uh they can ask to join

01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:06,000
oh it doesn't work now sylvia

01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:14,560
yay okay so

01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:18,000
we have around 30 minutes left

01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:20,719
um yeah 35 minutes

01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,320
30 30 minutes right so if anyone wants

01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:25,679
to share the work

01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:26,800
um this would be a good time or if you

01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:30,719
have

01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:33,360
anything to share with inkscape um

01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:34,960
something to pick up or i can um tell

01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,679
you guys about some features that have

01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,719
uh

01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:40,400
i can help you and escape while

01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:44,320
designing badges because

01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:47,360
um all i wanted to tell you

01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:50,400
it's like i'm already done with that

01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:54,080
so would you guys like to learn some

01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:58,400
inkscape hacks as i call them

01:19:54,080 --> 01:20:00,239
um or you can just show your work

01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:02,640
because we do have a half round left i

01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:06,239
mean this this thing is going to run

01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:07,840
for two hours can you show how i can add

01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:10,000
something

01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:12,400
from the templates to the badge on a

01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,400
layer yeah

01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:16,080
so just to make sure that i understand

01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:18,560
your question correctly

01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:20,400
um when you say templates do you mean

01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:24,159
the empty templates or do you mean

01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:24,159
the existing badges

01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:33,760
the existing so basically the uh older

01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:36,560
artworks

01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:38,000
with the characters okay great let's do

01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:42,080
a fresh one right

01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:44,320
um both badges

01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:45,920
if you have a badge in mind that you

01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:47,120
would like me to do specifically you can

01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:50,800
drop the link here

01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:50,800
or i can just pick any random badge

01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:56,000
i actually have a badge that would be

01:20:53,840 --> 01:21:01,840
good for this

01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:01,840
i'm going to open

01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:07,120
hmm let's see

01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:14,480
so i have a bunch of different badges

01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:17,920
here

01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:19,679
ambassador badge the pirate

01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:22,320
and what i'm going to do is i'm going to

01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:29,199
use the

01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:32,320
cowboy magic

01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:34,639
uh okay that's great

01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:35,679
honestly i would love to see what you

01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:39,040
come up with

01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:41,440
because um l10n is a

01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:42,719
very good team they work so much i would

01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:45,840
really like them to have

01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:45,840
a badge

01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:52,159
okay so this is uh

01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:56,800
this is an existing badge and um let me

01:21:56,159 --> 01:22:00,639
just ask

01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:02,800
uh sayak are you okay with um

01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:04,880
downloading the badge or should i do

01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:07,760
that also because i have i had it

01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:10,159
yeah you're okay okay great so after you

01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:12,639
open the batch this is what you get

01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:14,639
and let's say i wanted to have a batch

01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:16,880
so a lot of times these elements

01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:17,920
will be grouped together sometimes they

01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:20,400
may not be

01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:21,920
this is not so the first thing i'm going

01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:24,320
to do is if i need

01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:26,960
let's say i need this all right i'm

01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:31,199
going to select all of this

01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:31,199
i've not selected everything but

01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:36,000
select this guy right here and

01:22:34,190 --> 01:22:37,760
[Music]

01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,280
it's going i'm just checking if i have

01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,880
everything yeah and then i'm going to

01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:44,960
group it

01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:44,960
and i'm going to oh wait

01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:54,480
i am going to see so basically what is

01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:59,360
happening here is we have a flip

01:22:54,480 --> 01:23:02,400
on group ungroup

01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:06,159
there are a lot of different layers here

01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:08,639
okay this guy there we go so

01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:10,159
we have removed the sky and what i'm

01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:12,719
going to do is i'm going to release

01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:17,280
clips so these are all clipped

01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:19,280
um and then we have this guy

01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:20,719
right and it's already grouped so you

01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:26,000
can use it

01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:26,000
you can just copy it and

01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:34,239
this one has a friend so you can do that

01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:36,159
um the set clip tool is something that

01:23:34,239 --> 01:23:37,760
a lot of people i don't know i did not

01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:39,840
know about it until i would say

01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:41,360
two months ago so if you want me to go

01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,080
with the set clip to it because it's

01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:45,679
used

01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:47,120
very frequently um when you're designing

01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:49,520
your batch because you need

01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:51,840
to get the specific shape of the badge

01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:56,159
so if you want i can discuss that

01:23:51,840 --> 01:24:00,639
and that's actually really fun to use so

01:23:56,159 --> 01:24:04,080
yeah okay great so

01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:07,440
so the set clip tool is actually as you

01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:08,239
saw if i have this guy right here and i

01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:12,400
want

01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:14,639
to kind of cut it around this shape

01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:17,360
that's why we use the set clip layer so

01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:21,840
i'm just going to

01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:24,560
undo everything and i'm going to

01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,960
delete this guy for now i have it copied

01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:28,320
so

01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:30,639
that's okay so

01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:31,840
an easy way to understand what the set

01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:35,440
tip tool does is

01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:36,719
think of it as cutting cookies from a

01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:39,840
cookie dough

01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:41,679
so you how you have the cookie cutter

01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:44,000
this shape right here this is the cookie

01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:47,679
cutter and this guy right here is

01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:50,400
our cookie dough so

01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:52,320
what you do is we will position it

01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:53,199
somewhere here let's say i only want it

01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:55,040
here

01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:56,840
i don't want the bottom half i only want

01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:59,840
the top half

01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:59,840
so

01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:05,520
yeah okay so what i do

01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:07,360
is i'm going to select this object right

01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:09,280
here the shape this is a cookie cutter

01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:12,880
and i'm going to duplicate it

01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:15,199
so to duplicate you can use

01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:17,280
right click duplicate or the shortcut

01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:20,400
ctrl d

01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:23,760
and now you have a copy of the

01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:24,719
cookie cutter so to say on the on top of

01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:27,440
the stack

01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:28,159
so it's important that you use duplicate

01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:30,719
because

01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:31,760
what duplicate does is it copies the

01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:34,320
object

01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:36,639
right on top of the original object if

01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:40,080
you use copy base so if i

01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:41,760
copy this i have copied this and if i

01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:43,920
paste it somewhere here

01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:45,440
it's going to paste wherever my mouse

01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:47,920
pointer is

01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:49,840
so if i even if i try to paste it on top

01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:52,480
of the original object i will

01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:53,360
definitely be off by a few pixels you

01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,360
don't want to do that

01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:57,120
so i would advise you to select the

01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:59,600
duplicate tool

01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:01,520
then we select the object on top this is

01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:03,280
a cookie cutter a cookie

01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:05,840
cutter should always be on top when

01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:10,639
you're cutting a cookie

01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:10,639
select the dough right click

01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:20,239
so now we have this in the shape of

01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:20,239
our badge

01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,480
i hope that makes it clear i can do a

01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:27,280
couple of more examples if you want

01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:28,560
this comes in really handy um if you

01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:31,440
want to

01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:32,400
sort of clip the object in a specific

01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:35,600
shape

01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:36,000
um in skip does not have a crop tool as

01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,159
far as

01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,600
i know so you can also use it as a crop

01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:43,120
tool

01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:45,280
just use a rectangle and

01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:46,800
basically use that a rectangle as a

01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:48,840
cookie cutter

01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:50,080
and the thing about that clip is it's

01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:53,440
non-destructive

01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:56,080
so the thing is even though this guy

01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:56,960
does not have a bottom half the thing is

01:26:56,080 --> 01:27:00,639
if you do

01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:03,679
release flip you get back

01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:06,719
your cookie cutter and

01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:08,880
your badger so that's why uh the

01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:10,800
thing is when you are using cyclip it

01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:14,000
consumes the

01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:15,040
cookie cutter so uh that's why we create

01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:19,920
a duplicate and

01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:21,920
do not use the original one

01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:24,080
okay so you can try sort of experiment

01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:27,360
with it a little bit it's really fun

01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:30,639
so if i put the badger on top and

01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:31,600
let's see what happens so the badger is

01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:34,320
now

01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:36,400
the cookie cutter and so it's in the

01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:38,080
shape of the badger

01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:41,360
so maybe this can work nice for

01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:41,360
silhouettes if you want

01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:46,960
yeah it's it's really simple i mean i

01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:50,320
can't tell you the times i have

01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:50,960
like tried to adjust objects pixel by

01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:54,480
pixel

01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:58,639
yeah so now basically the whole thing

01:27:54,480 --> 01:28:00,239
has uh the pattern the

01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:02,159
pattern of the dough and now our dough

01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:04,400
was just pink background

01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:05,679
so honestly set clip is really fun to

01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:10,239
use

01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:12,639
um yeah i mean if you

01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:16,880
let's see let's try to have some fun

01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:16,880
here what happens if i do multiple

01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:23,760
so you can do a create clip group

01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:26,880
and that does not work so you can't do

01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:26,880
multiple things i think

01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:33,760
what you can do is

01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:33,760
you can convert this to

01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:38,239
check you out maybe i don't know what

01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:41,600
i'm doing right now

01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:46,480
and yep there we go

01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:49,360
so if you want to use multiple

01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:49,360
cookie doughs and

01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:59,840
there you go now you have a half blue

01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:59,840
badges in it but yeah

01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:05,040
so this is what the set clip tool is

01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:06,560
it's really fun to use

01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,920
it's going to help you a lot i mean

01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:11,840
you're going to use it if you're

01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:11,840
designing badges

01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:19,199
yeah that's why i chose this one i

01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:21,440
really like

01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:23,440
and honestly if you of these

01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:25,840
notifications okay so honestly if you

01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:27,760
look at the you get some of the badges

01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:28,880
and kind of play around with them a bit

01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:31,920
and you

01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:33,440
ungroup or sorry release the clip

01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:35,520
you will find that there are some hidden

01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:37,840
objects sometimes

01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:39,520
there are some old artworks or sometimes

01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:42,880
it's really funny down there because

01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:46,159
the bottom half is underdeveloped

01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:48,480
um i think i remember that just like

01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:48,480
that

01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:54,239
hmm

01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:56,000
so these are some of the more complex

01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:59,040
badges

01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:01,520
let's see if i can find the security

01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,520
patcher

01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:14,800
sorry escape is really slow i'm pretty

01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:17,360
sure

01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:19,040
that is going to crash because i have so

01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:24,239
many chrome tabs open

01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:24,239
and i'm streaming okay so

01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:30,880
yeah so this guy right here let's see

01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,880
what he's hiding

01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:35,840
hmm

01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:43,120
so this guy actually

01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:43,760
does not have any legs oh these are some

01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:48,800
layers

01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:50,639
that are some messy

01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:52,080
i don't know we have a lot of patterns

01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:56,239
here

01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:58,560
so i could delete my board it's a lot

01:30:56,239 --> 01:30:58,560
wow

01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:06,800
so this guy does not have any legs

01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:08,159
it's just over this so

01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:10,239
that's what that's what's going to

01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:12,159
happen if you you know kind of play

01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:15,040
around mess around with the badges and

01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:16,560
release clip you don't even have to work

01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,199
on the whole bathroom that way you don't

01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:19,040
have to

01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:20,320
you just you can just clip it right

01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:23,280
where you want it and

01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:23,280
no one has to know

01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,800
okay let's see

01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:32,080
so is does anyone have anything else

01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:36,080
that they want to ask

01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:38,400
um i'm trying to think of what else i

01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:40,560
can show you guys in escape because

01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:42,159
i think i've pretty much covered the

01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:45,679
fedora aspect like

01:31:42,159 --> 01:31:49,920
you know follow the style guide

01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:49,920
that's essentially it um

01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:56,159
if there's any specific feature that you

01:31:52,239 --> 01:32:00,400
would like to demonstrate i can try that

01:31:56,159 --> 01:32:03,280
um let's see i'm thinking

01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:05,199
i think one important thing is i i

01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:06,239
mentioned this before also but if you're

01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:08,080
trying to let's say

01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:09,360
i'm trying to recolor it so this is a

01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:12,880
shortcut that i actually

01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:15,040
discovered a short time ago so if i'm

01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:17,520
trying to change the fill

01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:19,040
i can click so this this is me just

01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,840
clicking and it's going to change the

01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:22,480
fill

01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:23,280
so just change the fill right as you can

01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:25,840
see

01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:27,679
but if i press shift i'm pressing the

01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:29,360
shift key right now and i press click

01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:31,290
it's going to change the stroke

01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:33,040
so that's really handy um

01:32:31,290 --> 01:32:35,679
[Music]

01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:37,679
that's a quick way to change strokes

01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:39,840
before that i was manually going and

01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:42,320
changing

01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:44,560
because going in this panel here and

01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:48,320
selecting the colors

01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:51,600
doing this yeah

01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:55,440
so that's not a very good way

01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:55,440
um let's see there you go

01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:03,120
oh so i that's a cool idea because i

01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:03,120
actually

01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:11,199
oh i'm so sorry i did not realize

01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:12,719
i'm just going to kill the application

01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:16,159
from the task manager

01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:20,000
i don't actually have it open

01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:20,000
once it opens it just keeps

01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:24,719
yeah oh that's a lot

01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:28,000
how do i

01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:37,840
honestly it's it i opened it once

01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:37,840
and i'm just going to mute

01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,920
just in case

01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:51,840
yep

01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:58,560
okay so okay so we have some comments uh

01:33:56,719 --> 01:34:00,080
okay so sylvia says so it's okay if it's

01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:03,040
legless actually yeah

01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:03,760
i mean a lot of design um is sort of

01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:06,080
like that

01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:06,800
you just work on the part that is

01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:09,199
complete

01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:11,199
because no one really sees the bottom

01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:12,719
half so it's okay if he's legless

01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:13,440
because i guess the person who designed

01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:15,840
that design

01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:17,120
bad you're from scratch so and they knew

01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:18,000
they were going to use the top half

01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:21,760
anyway

01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:25,280
so they decided to skip designing the

01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:26,800
badges or sorry the legs that's not a

01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:29,199
problem

01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:31,120
and science says how about we try to do

01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:31,760
a quick design for a badge for this

01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:35,920
sessions

01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:37,840
attendees that's actually a cool idea

01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:39,760
we can do that so we have around 20

01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:41,199
minutes that's just enough time to do

01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:43,040
that

01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:45,119
i have muted the notifications okay

01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:49,119
sylvia asks click on the arrow

01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:49,119
what arrow hmm

01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:52,560
if

01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:57,760
uh if you could maybe

01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:05,280
oh oh okay

01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:07,600
i see okay

01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:07,600
okay

01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:15,600
no problem louise okay so let's

01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:18,800
design something for this

01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:23,280
sessions attendees um

01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:28,400
does anyone have any idea um

01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:30,719
let's see i can go to

01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:32,560
the badges project to look up some

01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:35,600
inspiration

01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:39,679
um or if you guys have any idea

01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:39,679
we could work on it

01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:45,679
um let's see so i know that the design

01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:48,080
team has the design ninja

01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:50,400
that is actually really nice um

01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:54,719
something related to pen or arts maybe

01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:59,600
yeah we could use a palette i think

01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:59,600
we have it in the vag index

01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:08,000
so this is the place i go to first

01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:11,119
um because everything

01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:14,560
that is in the docks in the templates

01:36:11,119 --> 01:36:17,119
it is right here also so if you guys

01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:20,000
point out if you guys see anything

01:36:17,119 --> 01:36:22,320
you can also uh and just drop this link

01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,320
again

01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:29,040
if you guys want to look it up

01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:30,960
maybe you can send a link of some of a

01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:34,480
badge

01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:35,600
oh actually we already have a badge for

01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:38,719
this

01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:39,360
i remember it now i saw it when i was

01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:42,560
watching the

01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:44,800
video for the previous workshop we have

01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:44,800
this

01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:50,159
i mean it's pretty cool

01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,159
so

01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:55,679
yeah you attended a fedora by this

01:36:53,199 --> 01:36:55,679
workshop

01:36:55,760 --> 01:37:02,159
so i guess someone has fully thought of

01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:05,600
it first but honestly it was a good idea

01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:06,639
so this was actually designed four years

01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:12,000
ago

01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:12,000
and it's cool it's pretty nice

01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:15,679
and it's loading it's a little bit slow

01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:20,880
there we go

01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:24,880
this is the png

01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:28,080
and um okay so

01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:33,520
uh currently uh marie

01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:36,560
um i think this is nismo and

01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:37,520
lenova these people have the

01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:41,840
authorization

01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:44,800
what i'll do yeah definitely we can

01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:48,480
create one for next specifically

01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:51,199
yeah great okay so now that we have

01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:53,520
an idea like this is something that

01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:55,679
people wanted

01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:57,440
we can work on this we can use a paint

01:37:55,679 --> 01:38:00,639
brush

01:37:57,440 --> 01:38:03,840
we can use a pen or we can use a palette

01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:06,080
think that would work

01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:07,199
since we have around 10 minutes left you

01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:09,360
don't want to make anything too

01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:13,119
complicated

01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:15,520
um we can use the palette from this

01:38:13,119 --> 01:38:18,320
artwork right here

01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:18,639
yeah i mean all of these badges are sort

01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,480
of

01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:22,159
aren't related so you will definitely

01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:25,600
find something here

01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:27,679
um i already have this badge it's

01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:29,360
obtained like i've already downloaded it

01:38:27,679 --> 01:38:30,000
but it's a pain to find so i'm going to

01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:33,040
download it

01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:35,280
again you guys can see how that works

01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:35,280
so

01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:44,560
yeah this is one of the earlier badges

01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:48,480
which you will see

01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:48,480
the links are kind of broken

01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:52,239
so this was so

01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:01,360
hmm

01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:02,159
so even the pngs don't load so we can't

01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:05,520
really

01:39:02,159 --> 01:39:07,600
we'll have to download each svg so and

01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:10,400
see

01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:10,400
which one works

01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:13,840
nope

01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:37,520
let's see if this is the one nope

01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:41,840
um what was this badge called

01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:45,280
uh so this is the first badge okay

01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:45,280
so maybe artist one

01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:48,639
could be this one

01:39:49,119 --> 01:39:53,760
i really like the this series but

01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:56,480
honestly it's a pain to find the exact

01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:56,480
patch you want

01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:01,840
it's a bit funny also

01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:09,840
now this one

01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:17,920
let's see hmm

01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:19,520
birth of badger

01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:22,719
[Music]

01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:25,040
 let's see if i can

01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:27,040
i have to download the png also so it's

01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:30,239
just going to download

01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:32,080
the svg um

01:40:30,239 --> 01:40:34,840
well there are only six badges and

01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:37,840
you're on our third try so we are 15

01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:37,840
through

01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:46,719
yep that's what i'm trying to look for

01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:51,040
it's just that

01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:53,119
all the badges for this series was

01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:54,320
like it's essentially uploaded in the

01:40:53,119 --> 01:40:58,000
same ticket

01:40:54,320 --> 01:41:01,199
and they're not um correctly

01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:02,880
named i guess that's that could be a

01:41:01,199 --> 01:41:07,840
lesson for all of us too

01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:07,840
um name it correctly um

01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:13,040
my god i think the last one that we're

01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:16,159
going to try

01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:19,840
that's the one oh i think it's this one

01:41:16,159 --> 01:41:19,840
i hope is this one

01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:38,320
yay finally okay so

01:41:35,679 --> 01:41:38,320
i'm just gonna

01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:48,400
open this one and does anyone

01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,560
have any other idea how we could remix

01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,560
it

01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:58,639
ah we found it so yeah

01:41:55,600 --> 01:42:00,080
um i know right trust me i've been on

01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:03,280
this ticket so many times

01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:04,719
and this happens all the time like every

01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:06,560
time i have to download each and every

01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:10,080
one of them

01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:11,920
but yeah okay so we have this palette i

01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:13,360
think we can get rid of the background

01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:16,719
because it's very specific

01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:18,080
to the artwork um what do you guys think

01:42:16,719 --> 01:42:20,880
about that should i remove

01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:20,880
the background

01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:31,280
you can say yes or no yeah great

01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:35,280
so what i'm going to do is

01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:38,320
just select different bits and pieces

01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:41,040
and delete it

01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:42,159
nope that's the background can't delete

01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:45,440
that

01:42:42,159 --> 01:42:47,840
it's going to delete this graphics just

01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:47,840
a lot

01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:55,040
but honestly this this is this series is

01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:57,840
one of my favorite badges it was

01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:57,840
so very pretty

01:42:58,239 --> 01:43:02,159
okay so pro tip if you want to select

01:43:00,159 --> 01:43:03,600
some something some object that is

01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:05,440
behind

01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:06,960
another object so just drag this one

01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:10,000
right here select

01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:12,800
this and press ctrl z or

01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:14,239
undo your selection will still be there

01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:17,760
i use this

01:43:14,239 --> 01:43:19,679
all the time and it's really helpful

01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:21,360
so i'm going to do this again because we

01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:25,520
have another thing right here

01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:29,119
select this undo delete

01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:33,520
i'm going to delete these layers also

01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:33,520
right and

01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:42,159
this was a community badge right

01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:44,080
yes nest specific so um we have the nest

01:43:42,159 --> 01:43:45,440
logo but honestly i think if you put in

01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:49,440
the nest logo

01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:50,800
um we could actually what if we try to

01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:53,600
show that this

01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:55,199
guy is actually painting the nest logo

01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:58,000
maybe

01:43:55,199 --> 01:43:58,000
what do you guys think

01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:08,159
like yeah yep

01:44:04,239 --> 01:44:08,719
okay great i actually have the logo with

01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:12,080
me

01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:12,080
so i'm just going to import it

01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:21,840
and let's see next logo

01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:21,840
there we go

01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:26,480
that's a big board um

01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:34,239
nope i'm going to read the

01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:37,920
select the lock aspection and do it

01:44:34,239 --> 01:44:40,480
there we go and i'm going to remove this

01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:40,480
background

01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:51,840
ungroup

01:44:48,159 --> 01:44:54,000
nope one more time there we go

01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:55,040
delete it let's see if you guys have any

01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,280
other

01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:59,760
yeah it should be smaller right so i'm

01:44:57,280 --> 01:45:04,159
just going to

01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:08,000
resize this group this

01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:08,000
resize this and

01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:13,360
and i'm going to bring it to the top

01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:16,639
there we go

01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:18,400
so what is the next step i think you

01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:20,639
should change the background color and

01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:23,360
maybe lighten it a bit because

01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:24,000
it's quite heavy and then this logo is

01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:26,639
very

01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:29,119
light colored so it doesn't really it

01:45:26,639 --> 01:45:30,639
seems a little bit

01:45:29,119 --> 01:45:34,800
i don't know it's mistake it's missing

01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:34,800
something what do you guys think

01:45:39,119 --> 01:45:42,639
yeah right i know right it's all blue

01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:44,480
i've already grouped it oh

01:45:42,639 --> 01:45:46,400
yes that's exactly what i was thinking

01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:50,000
we should make a canvas

01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:52,800
um do we have a canvas

01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,440
i don't want to make it from scratch i

01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:56,239
think we

01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:59,840
might have a canvas somewhere maybe

01:45:56,239 --> 01:45:59,840
otherwise we'll make it from scratch

01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,119
meanwhile you guys can also look through

01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:06,000
the

01:46:03,119 --> 01:46:06,800
uh badges index see if you can find a

01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:11,600
canvas

01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:15,280
i am not sure if there is one

01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:17,760
just going to quickly scan these

01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:18,400
i mean if there was it would already be

01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:23,440
in the

01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:23,440
community section okay

01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:30,400
nope

01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:30,400
yes let's look at the templates

01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:38,480
because designing from scratch

01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:41,840
is not very fun

01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:45,119
at least that's what i think um

01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:45,119
i go to dogs

01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:53,360
they drop the link here

01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:56,719
i'm just going to i

01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:59,760
have so many tabs open oh my god

01:46:56,719 --> 01:47:02,320
okay i'm going to go

01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:04,320
through my own slides and find the link

01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:09,840
here

01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:09,840
this is the style guide yep

01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:14,880
i feel like i've seen okay i know

01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:14,880
somewhere

01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:24,800
i'm just going to use look at this

01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:24,800
hmm

01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:29,280
okay so

01:47:30,159 --> 01:47:34,880
let's see language

01:47:35,119 --> 01:47:39,600
no right or did i miss it

01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:53,280
no canvas um

01:47:50,639 --> 01:47:56,320
the badge graphic templates um this is

01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:56,320
this is actually though

01:47:56,910 --> 01:48:02,080
[Music]

01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:05,840
that was not fun okay this is a

01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:10,159
miscellaneous graphics that i opened and

01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:10,159
um we have a mirror but we don't have a

01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:21,040
canvas

01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:21,760
we actually are looking for it so this

01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:25,360
is uh

01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:28,400
you guys want to help me look

01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:31,440
here maybe something that can be

01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:35,440
sort of modified to

01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:35,440
you to make it appear like a canvas

01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:41,760
maybe um i'll drop the link here see if

01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:46,000
you guys

01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:49,760
can think of something hmm

01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:54,080
or we can just google a canvas image and

01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:57,040
you know sort of draw it from scratch

01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:57,040
not really a big fan

01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:01,840
uh

01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:05,600
what do you guys think is there

01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:06,960
something else that we can use from you

01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:09,199
maybe

01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:09,199
um

01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:17,119
i and we have this this is a actually a

01:49:15,119 --> 01:49:19,040
screen

01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:21,280
a projector screen maybe you can use

01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:21,280
this

01:49:22,159 --> 01:49:26,639
yeah we we should create one from

01:49:24,639 --> 01:49:29,280
scratch

01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:30,080
all right you oh you could we could show

01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:31,679
it to be

01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:35,199
the badger to be painting in the middle

01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:35,199
that's actually a really nice idea

01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:43,840
let me just look up

01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:43,840
canvas um

01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:47,599
like this right

01:49:49,199 --> 01:49:52,719
um so i'm just i just copied that what

01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:57,119
i'm going to do

01:49:52,719 --> 01:50:00,159
is i'm going to

01:49:57,119 --> 01:50:00,159
paste it right here

01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:07,040
so i do not drop

01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:09,599
graphics from scratch very often so

01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:11,199
um while the canvas is an easy thing to

01:50:09,599 --> 01:50:14,400
draw i would say

01:50:11,199 --> 01:50:16,480
um yeah

01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:18,320
so please don't laugh at my failed

01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:21,040
attempts i'm just i'm going to be going

01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:24,800
to see what works what doesn't

01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:28,400
um stroke

01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:30,719
and wow

01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:30,719
okay

01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:41,840
yep i have sort of

01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:41,840
yep there we go so let's have

01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:53,840
maybe do this definitely

01:50:46,719 --> 01:50:53,840
need to increase the stroke

01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:08,000
yeah and i think we could do something

01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:11,520
similar for

01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:15,119
these sticks just

01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:18,639
a tiny bit of this maybe

01:51:15,119 --> 01:51:21,840
make it a little bit round i guess

01:51:18,639 --> 01:51:26,560
the and three

01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:29,599
um let's use this color and this color

01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:32,719
i'm going to reduce the stroke

01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:34,560
because it's a small object i'm going to

01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:37,360
see if you guys have any suggestions in

01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:40,400
just a minute

01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:43,760
do this click on it

01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:43,760
rotate it a bit

01:51:46,639 --> 01:51:51,920
and put it behind does that look good

01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:56,400
yeah okay maybe should i round this i

01:51:55,760 --> 01:52:00,400
don't know

01:51:56,400 --> 01:52:00,400
i don't think so just going to

01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:07,840
um help me

01:52:03,199 --> 01:52:07,840
this i'm going to

01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:14,400
use this again right here

01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:23,119
and maybe

01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:27,360
i will copy this it's just right here

01:52:23,119 --> 01:52:27,360
and flip it there we

01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:32,639
i'll go it here

01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:41,119
i'm going to copy this again

01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:45,840
this time i'm going to rotate it

01:52:41,119 --> 01:52:59,520
and let's see

01:52:45,840 --> 01:53:03,040
it's pretty tiny now just

01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:05,440
hmm what do you guys think about that

01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:06,880
it's that definitely needs something

01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:12,800
more

01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:15,679
this top bar here

i hope you learned something um

01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:13,360
because designing badges is really fun

01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:16,880
but i know

01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:20,080

and i hope if this helped you get past

01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:22,480
those

hurdles and maybe start wanting to
