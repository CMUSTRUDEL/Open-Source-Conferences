all right

00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,040
hi everybody um i i'm just gonna get

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,480
started i think

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,759
um so welcome to my presentation

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,880
on okd4 openshift kubernetes on fedora

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,039
40s

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,560
i'm christian glombeck i'm a software

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,720
engineer on the

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,680
car os team within the openshift

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,640
organization at red hat

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,439
and yeah we've been working on okd the

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,160
openshift

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:37,360
community distribution of kubernetes

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:44,000
that works foremost on fedora

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:46,399
core os so let's get started

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,200
uh the just a quick look at you at the

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,000
agenda

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,600
uh we'll talk about what is ok d4 what

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,440
is fedora coreos you may have heard a

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,360
little bit about fedora core riser

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,280
already then how to install

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,359
then we'll talk about the okd working

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,400
group we'll have a

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:08,159
look at the road ahead

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:12,000
and an ask me anything session

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:15,439
so let's get started what is okd4 okd4

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,680
is not an abbreviation it's uh it stands

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,080
for the origin community distribution

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,880
of kubernetes and what it is what that

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,680
means is it's the openshift codebase

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,360
the same as the openshift product we

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,370
have at red hat

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,680
running on top of fedora core os

00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:34,479
[Music]

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,040
and the special thing about this is we

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,240
have

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,479
just one life cycle here we manage the

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,840
operating system upgrades through the

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,560
cluster

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,880
so the operating system fedora core os

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,600
in

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,280
in the okd case really becomes just an

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,720
implementation detail

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,720
and the the administrator of the cluster

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,680
doesn't really have to worry too much

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,680
about it at all

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,079
so yeah we

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,399
have a little graph here so we have an

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,319
automated installation

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,720
and one life cycle as i said uh the

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,560
linux host runs fedora core os on top of

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,840
that is the kubernetes

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,560
and openshift code and on top of that

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,520
we have you can install any kubernetes

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,879
application

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,560
obviously we're looking to make this uh

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,879
very easy with operators from the

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,440
operator hub which are at the topmost

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,440
level

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,519
as services the the cluster admin or the

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,560
developer can install on top of the

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,160
cluster

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,280
and we run on almost all the clouds

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,080
so um it's really just

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,480
yeah it's really the same experience on

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,400
on

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,200
in all environments which is really

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,000
really cool i think um

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,760
so yeah you can install on bare metal

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,800
virtual machines

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,480
um openstack uh

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,360
aws cloud google cloud platform

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,040
azure currently doesn't uh we don't have

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,560
images on azure yet

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,560
you'll have to it works but you'll have

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,599
to upload the images yourself

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,760
before you can proceed um so let's have

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,120
a look at what is fedora korres

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,959
you may know a little about fedora

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,440
chorus already but i'll just

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,200
say it again it's an automatically

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,519
updating linux os

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,560
it's aimed specifically at containerized

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,360
workloads

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,360
it's based on rpm os 3 and ignition i'll

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,480
circle back to this a little bit

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,159
in a little bit it's built with a with

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,720
coreos assembler which is our build

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,560
system

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,120
for composing the os trees

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,560
and creating all the artifacts for the

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,840
different

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,560
different platforms for it um

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,640
and it's made out of fedora rpm packages

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,760
this is the only difference really

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,799
between okd and the openshift

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,680
ocp product we have at red hat

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:05,200
where those are rel packages obviously

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,439
we use fedora packages here

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,920
so just to say a little bit more about

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,560
rpm os tree

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,519
so that is a really cool technology

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,760
where

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,720
where images are essentially composed

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,280
it's like

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,000
git for operating systems so you have

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,560
one commit

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,680
describing the entire the entire

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,440
contents

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,600
of the of the os disks um

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,840
you may know a few other projects that

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,040
use os 3 like flat pack

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,759
or rpm os 3 specifically like fedora

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,560
silver blue

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,400
and fedora iot and fedora core os

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,160
obviously

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:48,000
ignition is our

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:51,759
well yeah it's our tool to uh

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,680
to describe um the config

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,800
you want to get so we don't use cloud

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,479
init we have

00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,560
ignition which is uh declarative

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,320
and i think that makes it superior to

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,280
cloud in it as well

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,960
so you can describe any custom conflict

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,600
you want in ignition

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,840
configuration and then that is applied

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,520
at the first boot

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,080
and the once the machine comes up it'll

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,600
have the config you described before

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,960
so that's really really cool uh

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,280
in the okd and openshift case we

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,120
continue to manage that ignition

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,600
configuration

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,560
as a day two operation which means after

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,320
the initial install

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,759
ignition won't run again but we will

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,240
still

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,720
be able to react to changes in that

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,720
config

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,479
so how to install it's it's super simple

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,280
if you

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,880
use the ipi the installer provisioned

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,600
infrastructure path

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,360
you just head to okdio go to download

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,639
download the installer

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:03,440
and then you'll need a an account on a

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:06,080
public public cloud and it'll install

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,520
automatically everything that is if you

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,479
want to spend that money on the public

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,720
clouds

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,759
if you have your own infrastructure

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,479
you'll um

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,680
you'll use the upi user provision

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,240
infrastructure

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,319
install flow which for which you'll have

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,319
to set up a few things before you can

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,240
run the installer and get everything

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,199
started

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,240
all of that is documented on on

00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,840
docs.okd.io

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,240
and there's a few more links here so we

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,919
have a github repository um

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,600
openshift slash okd and openshift slash

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,600
community

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,319
so if you wanna there's guides there for

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,800
very yeah for a few setups on various

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,800
clouds and also some minimal setups

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,280
if you don't need a full-blown cluster

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,840
so the okd working group

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,800
we've been working

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,599
hard on on getting okd out so okd 4

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,400
is ga now and we've done that

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,919
with the okd working group so there's a

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,199
few engineers from redhead vadim

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,400
rutkowski

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,199
charlotte grover we have diane mueller

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,240
our community director there

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:31,840
and yeah we

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:35,199
have bi-weekly meetings

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,800
on um on a blue jeans video chat

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:42,240
so you can find the dates for for those

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,599
uh on the um fedora calendar

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:50,319
okd so that's apps.fedoraproject.arc

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:53,840
slash calendar slash okd fedocal

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:56,080
we also hang out on slack all the time

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,319
on the openshift dev and openshift users

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,280
channel on the kubernetes slack

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,919
and on on almost all the channels in the

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,960
openshift commons slack if you're

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,960
if you remember there

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:14,240
yeah again the two repositories as well

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:17,280
and we have a google group that we

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,400
also use as a mailing list so everything

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,280
we discuss uh all yeah all important

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,080
things

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,680
are usually sent out on on that and you

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,039
can start a discussion there as well

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,039
if you don't use slack

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,279
and i think

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,360
i think i missed the road ahead section

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,360
here

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,480
let's just yeah we wrote ahead so um i

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,440
think i missed this slide somewhere

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,240
well so we we're planning as part of

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,240
your

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,880
okd working group we've sort of created

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,600
a road map together with the community

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,640
and the first part phase zero we've just

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,920
finished was

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,080
releasing ga okay d4ga

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,519
um so we're very proud we got that out

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,320
the door and now

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,040
we're looking into the future there's

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,720
many things

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:14,720
still to do and um things we can

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,000
can try and and uh well develop in in

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,720
the longer run

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,839
and are one of the main reasons why we

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,600
wanted to

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:26,320
have openshift run on fedora core os

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,160
as a prime target it's not only that the

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,360
community benefits from it obviously we

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,959
want that

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,680
but we also now have a a feedback

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,360
cycle essentially where we can test out

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,320
the things

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,640
on the newest on the fedora kernel and

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,120
on

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,360
on all the things that will end up in in

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,440
the next rail release essentially

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,200
so it'll also our product will benefit

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,120
from it

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,720
which i think is really cool we never

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,800
really had that with um

00:09:52,720 --> 00:10:01,040
openshift origin or okd 3.x

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:05,600
but now we really have have this

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:08,399
ability to test things before it lands

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,920
in the product so i really want to

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,399
invite everybody

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,600
to the working group if you want new

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,560
features if you

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,320
think there's an operator that needs to

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,839
run on okd

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,300
um please join us we have an operator

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,040
wish list

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,480
[Music]

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:31,200
so we're gonna work on on enabling all

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,800
those operators to run on okd as well

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,240
right now we've just focused on the core

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,880
operators on the core

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,839
openshift make that run on fedora core

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,360
os

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,640
there's a few things because fedora

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:46,000
coreos is not the same as rel core os

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,399
we have for example we don't have python

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,680
on fedora core os so there's a few

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,440
limitations there

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,720
we really because that is because we

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,160
really want to

00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:00,240
have people run their applications

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,320
in containers on fedora coreos so

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,760
everything should really be packaged as

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,160
a container and not

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,160
run on the host directly some operators

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,360
on the operator hub still

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,160
rely on dependencies like that so

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,000
there is somewhere needed and i'd like

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,279
to invite everybody to

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,880
to join us to help out with this effort

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,959
the more people we can get the more

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,279
testers the more

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,120
volunteers that actually contribute

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,120
their

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,560
the better it'll be and the quicker

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,360
we'll get there

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,120
um and that is i think that is the great

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,480
thing about the okd working group

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,000
because now we have we have enabled the

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,120
community to actually

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,279
contribute to open shift upstream

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:50,160
development and operator upshift to

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:52,320
upstream development um yeah that was

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,760
that's the road ahead we really want to

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,600
enable and

00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:01,839
build out that ecosystem we also want to

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:05,040
use okd um for

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,720
for new features or new technologies

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,600
that haven't

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,320
that haven't landed in in the product

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,320
yet

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,639
so for example if there's anybody in the

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,519
community who'd like to use psyllium or

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,399
something

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,680
um we really want to help out with that

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,600
effort and discuss

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,760
design and options to

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,310
to make that work because that is i

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,680
think

00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,880
[Music]

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,920
beneficial for everybody um so yeah once

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,600
again

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,399
please join the okd working group if

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,399
you're interested

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,880
um yeah

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,480
so we have those meetings um they're on

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,440
the calendar and

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,200
also if you have if you hit any issues

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,399
if it's a technical one

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,760
um like a an rfe

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,839
or just a bug uh please open an issue on

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,079
the okd repository

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,160
if you have questions about the working

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:05,279
group itself the process

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,880
ideas how to improve that the community

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,880
repository would be the right place

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:21,760
and with that uh

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:25,519
i will answer any questions

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,519
i'm not sure if people can

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,480
activate their microphones but otherwise

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,839
i'll just look in the chat

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,079
if you have any questions please go

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,040
ahead

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,040
i'm happy to answer

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:55,279
okay so there's one question uh

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,279
actually let me scroll up a little bit

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,800
okay uh support for liver vm

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,600
installation so

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,560
we don't have support for it but it is

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,399
possible

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:13,519
um we just don't test it very often

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:16,639
um because it needs a huge ibm

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,000
essentially um we have quite a large

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,800
footprint still that's another thing we

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,240
want to

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:25,279
work on reduce the size of an open shift

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,959
okay the installation but it is possible

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,760
to run it in liquid you have to build

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,320
the installer

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,880
yourself because that is usually

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:36,720
disabled in the binaries

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:39,839
but you can do that from the openshift

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,959
installer repository there is a an fcos

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,680
branch essentially we have still

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,160
it's the exactly the same code base um

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,320
except

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,720
for right now two repositories with the

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,639
next release it'll just be the installer

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,320
uh that is different and that has to be

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,480
different right now because we

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,839
have to reference the fedora core as

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,880
images

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,839
and not the the rail corres images so if

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,480
you go to that

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,519
repository the openshift installer on

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,639
github

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,680
and go to the fcors branch fcos

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,199
branch check that out build the

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,959
installer from there

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,440
um you will be able to install it on

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,440
libvard

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,920
let me check a few more questions um

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,959
wouldn't word work via something like

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,320
cube word

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,959
so there is um an an operator for

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,199
cubework

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,160
and you can run that that is kind of the

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,639
the other way around

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,440
um installing on liver you install it in

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,320
the liver

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,279
virtual machine and with hubert you can

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,199
run virtual machines on your cluster

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,959
i'm not sure if that you can probably

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,880
nest that as well but that's definitely

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,000
the thing we haven't really tested

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,199
um but there's the cubeverd

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,279
operator um

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,399
which will enable you to run virtual

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,000
machines

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:05,120
in containers on openshift on okd

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,240
and that was one of the things that had

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,240
a python dependency up until

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,000
like two weeks ago so i'm not sure if

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,959
the new release is out yet

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,079
but with that release uh that commit has

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,880
merged to fix

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,320
to to drop the dependency so the kubert

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,880
operator should now

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,560
work on okd as well we haven't had time

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,360
to test that

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:37,839
though any feedback on that if you want

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:37,839
to give it a try that'd be great

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,519
why not add lipvert as well

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,519
yeah we we've disabled it in the in the

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,680
main binary because it's

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,040
it's not a thing you want to use in

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,000
production really

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,120
it doesn't make too much sense openshift

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,839
is made for

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,440
high availability and if you run it all

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,240
in one vm

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,360
you get none of that so yeah it's not a

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,400
production great thing

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,000
i wouldn't recommend um anybody using

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,559
that for for actually

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,520
uh for actual production clusters so

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,199
that's also

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,120
why we've disabled it because there's

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:20,160
not the real use case we want to give

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,439
with open with okd after all this is an

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,319
enterprise grade

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,880
cluster so you get all the goodness of

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,360
uh

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,760
of openshift to the product with all the

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:33,600
security all the

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:37,280
developer tools um it's really

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,520
yeah it's really kubernetes on steroids

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,679
and it's highly automated i just i think

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,840
i haven't really

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,520
stressed that enough it is highly

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,080
automated so

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,760
you have you essentially have a cluster

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,559
on autopilot

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,559
uh it'll update itself right now you

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,440
still have to click a button

00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:01,840
um but it's yeah it's really super easy

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,840
to maintain

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,679
okay matthew's question uh

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,520
how closely tight is our of course going

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,440
to be with okd going forward

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,520
will of course be primarily recommended

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,360
for use with okd or will it serve other

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,280
use cases

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,120
conversely is okay supported on other

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,640
distros so

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,360
um we are one use case for fedora core

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,240
os

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:35,520
the dark rose is still a thing that you

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,799
can also use in the single node use case

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,840
where you just want to run pod main

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,160
containers or

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,880
even use docker if you still want to do

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:48,400
that um

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,760
and yeah okd is the cluster use case for

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,880
fedora coreos so

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,960
we will actually will have a release

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,919
schedule that will

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,880
lag behind fedora korres by two by i

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,200
think one week

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,120
fedora coreos has bi-weekly releases and

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,960
we'll do bi-weekly or we are doing

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,000
bi-weekly releases in the

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,480
alternating weeks in between those uh

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,880
fedora coreos releases so we can

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,240
test those changes in the new fedora

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,919
coreos images

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:21,280
for one week before we put out another

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:23,120
okd release so it's not

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,960
super strictly coupled but obviously

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,840
it's one big use case

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,679
for fedora core os but still it's

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,919
separate projects fedora coreos wants to

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,720
support other use cases as well

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,480
and okd right now only supports fedora

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,720
core os

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,840
as a base operating system but we've

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,080
said from the beginning

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,000
that we'll do fedora cores first because

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,400
it makes most sense for us as a

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,720
community and also

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,760
for the company to to get that feedback

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,360
cycle

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,679
um but the community has already

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:59,520
expressed interest in for example

00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:02,960
core os uh that centers

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:06,000
sorry centos as base operating systems

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:11,039
and for that obviously somebody has

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:15,200
to build um kind of a centos core os

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,640
rpm os tree and create the artifacts

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,400
from that

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,640
and that is certainly possible we just

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,159
haven't had the time to look into it

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,760
and we appreciate any any help from the

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,159
community there as well and it's

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,840
it would also be possible to take uh

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,840
debian packages

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,679
compose that into an os tree and use

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:38,480
that as the base operating system

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:41,200
obviously the cluster side we have this

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,919
machine config operator that does

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,880
that maintains the ignition config after

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,039
installation

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,120
and maintains the disk state and

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:52,320
obviously that has a few assumptions

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,039
about the operating system

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,080
but then again that works with both rel

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,880
and

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,039
fedora package sets right now so it's

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,080
certainly possible to

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:07,440
to also use debian or

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,760
gen 2 or any other system you just have

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,840
to compose it into an os tree

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,039
and then you can get started with

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,960
testing that

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:19,200
um yeah primarily we focused on

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,240
fedora chorus now but now we've gone ga

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,280
and

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:31,840
we'll be open to adding more os's in the

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:31,840
future as well

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,480
what's the minimal required footprint

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,080
for okd

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:43,360
clusters it is quite large so

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,520
i think the recommendations

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,960
the of it's the same recommendations as

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,559
the official ocp

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:54,320
openshift product so you'd want um

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:57,600
six nodes three masters three workers

00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:01,280
um and each with 32

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,039
gig ram but i well is it each

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,640
it's it's definitely a lot but we've

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,240
been able to cut that down and even

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,440
install it in eight gig

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:13,120
machines um

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,360
yeah but that's not officially supported

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,159
we're definitely working on making that

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,919
um

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,240
officially supported it works right now

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:23,120
and i think charo

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,600
and also vadim if he's here have have

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,280
done a

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,640
quite have done quite a bit of testing

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,320
on that already

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,840
um but yeah right now it's

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,360
really recommended to have to have a

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,440
beefy machine or

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,200
multiple beefy machines you can also

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,760
make the master schedulable

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,240
so you only need three masters but three

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,440
is

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,080
the minimum required to get a proper

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,120
install

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,240
because of ncd which needs to maintain

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:55,840
quorum

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:55,840
and that high availability at all times

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,120
what is the interest in making okd

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,080
available for all architectures for

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,360
dorothy parks

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:18,480
that interest is big so

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,760
we really want to do that um that was

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,799
dennis gilmore's question

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,840
um and yeah we definitely want to do

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,640
that

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,320
and uh that is a thing we will be

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,480
focusing so i'll definitely

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,280
approach you dennis and um to talk about

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,799
that because we already

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,200
for fedora chorus i'm not sure we're

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,760
releasing all those platforms or builds

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,360
for all those platforms yet but we

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,400
already have the infrastructure

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,640
to build them so uh

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,320
with openshift we just have to rebuild

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:52,080
all the containers

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,679
um and then it should it should run so

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,279
we just have to set up a few

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,000
infrastructure bits to

00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,600
to get all that build but i think um

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,840
we'll get there that's definitely thing

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:05,840
we want to do

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,720
so yeah and just uh for the comment uh

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,960
glenn there's a new osg builder

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,720
that you can roll your own um yeah we're

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,960
looking we're also looking into

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,799
into um into how we can leverage that

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,240
so um i think there's quite a few

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:30,840
interesting bits

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:33,840
we can have a look at here um okay next

00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
question

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,960
not really a question but taro i just

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,159
reiterated that we're going to

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,240
start working on minimizing the

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,240
footprint i think that's that's also the

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,440
thing uh the community has requested

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,600
quite a few times

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,880
because not everybody has their huge

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,400
enterprise setup

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:55,039
ready to to roll their own cluster out

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,679
and that's that's definitely thing we'll

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,679
also look at

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:11,360
definitely that uh the minimization um

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,520
objective is a thing that i've i've also

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,960
kind of picked in from time to time and

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,480
i think um

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:21,919
minimizing that uh the entire system

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:24,799
is yeah is just important to

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,279
to do and uh it's a good long-term goal

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,919
right now

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,360
we're super happy we've just released ga

00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,799
and as you as you can see

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,799
there is still a lot of things to do

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,840
so if you want to join i'm just going to

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,640
say that again

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,080
if you want to join the working group

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,679
please do it

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,520
that is really the opportunity for

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,720
everybody to contribute to

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,320
um to voice their opinions and their

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,720
their problems

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,440
and request new features or even offer

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,559
to

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,240
to contribute some code um because that

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:59,360
is what we've also enabled now

00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,880
you can really contribute

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,880
in the upstream development now

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:12,240
so yeah i think my time is up

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:16,159
i'm not sure if there's more questions

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,159
but thank you all so much for joining

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:25,840
um and please continue to enjoy

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,840
