you probably

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,520
people have noticed diversity has been a

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,519
focus increasing diversity and inclusion

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,800
in fedora has been a focus over the last

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,840
few years

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:18,080
um and i tend to approach that

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,720
from a um it feels like the right thing

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,279
to do

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,119
approach i want to have a more

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,039
interesting more vibrant

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,039
um community with a lot of people with

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,640
different perspectives and different

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,199
appearances and just different

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,480
differentness in in what fedora is seems

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,600
right to me

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,000
um which is one approach to it

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,360
um i happen to see this talk that

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,600
frederick gave at uh

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,960
lisa which is my favorite conference

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,640
that is not flock

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,320
large installation systems

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,360
administration conference

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,199
and i was really impressed with uh

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,920
i i learned a lot from it and was

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,800
impressed with kind of the

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,000
data-driven approach to it i also as you

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,000
know from my charts and graphs

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,120
like data and i like the kind of the

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,039
scientific

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,159
approach to you know why this is good

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,840
for a project

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,280
and i thought it would be nice to have

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,280
that you know

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,560
have this for fedora community to to

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,840
listen to and think about

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,600
uh so we asked frederick to come um

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,880

all right let's see if i can figure this

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,439
out

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,880
i'm supposed to share my screen i

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,880
believe

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,840
all right

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,320
so can everyone see my screen i assume

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,520
so

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,560
it's working awesome great all right and

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,320
if you want to follow along there is a

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,479
you can actually use that link in your

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,280
own browser so i know there are

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,080
some questions around screenshots things

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,440
of that nature

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,200
so um yeah you can use that if if you

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,920
feel so inclined

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,800
um thanks again for you know taking the

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,520
time today

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,640
to listen to me again my name is uh

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,640
frederick mitchell and what we're going

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,160
to be talking about

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,160
today this morning i'm in the central

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,920
time zone in the united states

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,200
how math science and star trek kind of

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,239
prove

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,400
the value of diversity um

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,840
again i'm an american i've been a part

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,760
of

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,519
a different open source community called

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,920
drupal drupal is a content management

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,319
framework for about 15 years

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,200
so it's really awesome when i get to go

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,800
to other

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,480
open source communities kind of learn a

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,879
little bit about the community

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,519
um you know be a part of it and and just

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,319
kind of

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,400
you know engage with all the different

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,200
folks who are passionate about

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,319
you know their space um you know some

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,800
other things that

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,840
you know i guess are tied to who i am as

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,599
a person

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,760
you know i'm also a heterosexual black

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,680
man and what's interesting about you

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,040
know that concept is

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,400
you know there are certain things that i

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,440
may have some privilege on and other

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,519
things that i don't

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,680
and one of the things we're going to

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,560
kind of talk about today

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,599
is you know what does that mean um your

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,159
reality your

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,239
perspective your the way that you kind

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,720
of see the world is influenced

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,239
not only by you know your experiences

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,040
but how the world kind of

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,120
you know treats you and a lot of times

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,280
especially when people see me they think

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,040
that this talk is going to be about

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,040
you know race or their their thinkers

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,080
going to talk about

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,519
um you know maybe societal things and

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,640
and what i really want to focus on i

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,400
really want to talk about today is this

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,840
really isn't about

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,720
um you know kind of going deep into

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,879
those things

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,400
what we're really kind of focusing on

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,080
today is

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,200
how can we approach this idea

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,959
of what diversity is and if you have an

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,439
open mind and if you're trying to really

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,560
kind of again wrap your arms around

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,760
um how to place it within the context of

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,040
your kind of day day-to-day life

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,799
maybe this can kind of give you some

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,519
ideas so let's kind of let's definitely

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,720
kind of dive in

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,840
so again um what

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,080
we're really going to focus on um

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,520
in this you know 30 35 minutes is

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,720
something called mental models and if

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,199
you're not familiar with mental models

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,240
are

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,919
they basically are this idea that

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,680
you know the world is a complex place

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,280
and what are the ways that we can kind

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,880
of understand

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,520
how to think about

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,080
the world in general to help us simplify

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,680
it

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,600
it's a concept that's used by a lot of

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,120
entrepreneurs a lot of developers it's

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,400
probably something you've already you do

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,199
all the time but we're just going to

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,199
define a couple

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,479
i'm not really focused on trying to

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,240
convince you of something

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,840
or you know tell you that you're a bad

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,120
person again we just want to kind of

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,080
focus on

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,520
positioning um how can we think about

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,919
some of these concepts and what are we

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,000
really

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,280
sort of talking about so the first

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,199
mental model that i wanted

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,280
that i want to kind of throw out there

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,960
that a lot of these concepts

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,120
revolve around is something called

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,320
inversion which is when you're presented

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,680
with a problem you're presented with an

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,160
idea

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,160
instead of really focusing on you know

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,600
telling someone that hey that idea is

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,199
wrong you know prove me wrong that my

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,160
perspective is right maybe you inverted

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,840
and say

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,960
okay this is an idea what am i missing

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,039
um you know it's taking a concept and

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,440
inverting it to to really kind of see is

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,600
there

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,720
a a spot in there that that you may be

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,120
missing

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,560
so this isn't really about again when we

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,000
talk about diversity and

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,680
things that nature this isn't really

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,440
about i have a position

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,120
tell me why i'm wrong this is more about

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,160
are there things in my current

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,600
understanding

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,759
that i could be you know missing

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,440
the second mental model that this talk

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,199
revolves around is something called the

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,520
circle of competence

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,520
and basically that just means that you

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,720
know

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,479
is my goal of where i'm trying to go am

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,240
i just do i want to be validated

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,479
um do i want my perspective to be right

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,319
do i want to say aha see i i prove that

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,759
that this is that where i'm coming from

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,039
is correct

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,639
or is it really about um

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,479
what's a success look like and how do we

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,319
get there right and success can be

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,400
defined by a lot of things

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,240
um every time i you know kind of bring

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,400
this up you know

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,440
there's usually a an interesting quip

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,720
that comes back to me says

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:44,240
what if it means that me being right is

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,479
you know my success and my response is

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,360
well you kind of proven my point right

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,199
the fact that you would put

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,280
being right ahead of you know your

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,039
definition of success is exactly why

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,639
the difference between the two is really

00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,639
important to understand

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,720
um almost every decision and every um

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,479
quandary that you will you know probably

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,360
encounter in your life will always be

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,440
about

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,919
being right versus being successful and

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,520
really the goal of some of these ideas

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,039
that we'll be talking about is really

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,639
focus on the latter right

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,240
what does success look like and how do

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,520
we have a successful

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,880
open source fedora community

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,680
all right so let's kind of dive into

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,720
this so this

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,199
is again kind of um just a quick little

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,599
map

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,120
of where we are in the world right so

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,280
the first is

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,440
that diversity is a fact and when i say

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,080
that let's just kind of talk about it

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,160
from

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,400
a dictionary perspective right the

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,599
definition of diversity

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,840
it revolves around the idea that

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,520
things or you know something within a

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,160
particular context is different

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,560
so if we're talking about people right

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,680
because

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,199
we live in a diverse world there are

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,280
lots of different types of people

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,879
i mean there's i don't really know how

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,240
anyone can kind of argue that you can

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,840
slice that any way you want

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,280
right short tall different

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,720
physical attributes different

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,879
perspectives different experiences

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,360
different realities etc so

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,319
the differences amongst among us are not

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,919
really

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:18,400
in dispute that is a fact i think where

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,120
things kind of get tripped up is maybe

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,360
this

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,960
next two points which is what do we do

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,960
about that and what is

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,479
what does success look like the fact

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,319
that inclusion should probably be a

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,680
practice that we do how do we do things

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,560
to include more

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,159
perspectives include more people to

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,680
ultimately get to what success look like

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,000
which is equity

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,440
right and equity is an interesting kind

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,560
of concept

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,040
um sometimes folks you know kind of

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,839
confuse that with

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,320
treating people treating people equally

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,839
and

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,760
those things aren't necessarily the same

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,800
so like a good example is

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,600
you know if i were to give someone

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,519
who was poor ten thousand dollars and i

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,200
was to give someone who was really

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,360
really wealthy ten thousand dollars i

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,560
may be treating them equally

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,440
but equity was not achieved between the

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,279
two

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,040
right so treating someone equal is not

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,160
the same thing as treating someone the

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,000
same

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,200
and you not necessarily get to the same

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,600
goal um

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,240
if you you know don't necessarily parse

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,399
the difference between

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,000
equity being a goal and and just kind of

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,000
you know doing things treating people

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,360
equally and it's a it's a it's a nuance

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
but it's a really important kind of

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,519
difference

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,640
and the reason why that's that that

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,120
difference is so important is when you

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,839
look at the kind of graph below

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,959
we talk about or you hear folks kind of

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,640
talk about

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,440
you know why is this important why do i

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,800
care and the reason is because

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,279
you know if you're not invested

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,800
in the goals above again what does

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,800
success look like are we trying to be

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,720
right versus successful

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,560
then you know you might necessarily

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,800
achieve what you're trying to get on

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,320
on the right which is growth and you

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,000
stay inside of neutral well

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,640
unfortunately the opposite

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,959
of growth is inertia and the opposite

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,320
of trying to grow and bring more people

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,920
inside

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,040
is segregating them and separating them

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,320
and saying well they're not they don't

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,240
belong

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,079
and the folks who are able to kind of do

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,240
that are those with privilege

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,519
all different kinds of privilege and the

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,880
folks who are not able to that

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,120
are not able to be included and

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,920
ultimately feel oppressed and so again

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,800
just kind of

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,640
putting the map out there of neutrality

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,519
is a position

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,880
it's a position that anyone can take and

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,000
you know if that's the position that you

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,920
take that that's fine

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,440
but what we're kind of focusing on today

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,959
is how do we kind of move

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,640
from maybe the neutral position to the

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,240
growth position

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,040
and that's what that's that let's kind

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,959
of dive deeper into some of those ideas

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,399
all right so quickly let's play a game

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,279
so you have a young woman who's three

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,680
years old

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,800
when she started to read books and the

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,440
game is

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,800
guess her college gpa so you have a

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,760
couple of options

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,720
right you have you know she in the

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,200
middle

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,959
this is assuming a 4.0 scale for those

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,079
kind of a traditional gpa

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:13,519
right is it is it high is it low

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:16,880
and as you kind of think about this

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,560
you know and you make your guess

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,079
i think the most important thing to note

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,120
is

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:25,040
there really isn't a way to win this

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,360
game and i apologize for tricking you

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,160
but basically what i'm trying to kind of

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,519
put out here

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,079
is what you just did by connecting

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,519
you know a previous understanding of

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,800
someone's point in life and then trying

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,440
to project that out

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,040
to a future prediction is what we call

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,839
bias like that's what bias is

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,800
and even though that technically

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,920
typically has

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,519
a negative connotation the point that

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,040
i'm trying to make is

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,600
this is how human beings work

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,760
we have evolved and we create shortcuts

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,760
in our mind

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,200
for that very reason to understand or

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,279
try to you know connect

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,720
disparate concepts so that we can make

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,079
better decisions

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,000
and when we over index or take

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,839
different points that we can familiarize

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,040
with to make a conclusion that is

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,000
technically what bias

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,200
is and in a technical community

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,040
especially open source community with a

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,760
lot of different technologists who pride

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,000
themselves

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,120
on objective thinking and building

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,480
technical

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,240
you know outcomes sometimes we

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,839
get enamored with the idea that we are

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,200
not biased that we are objective we're

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,639
not subject to emotion

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,639
and the point that i'm trying to make

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,160
here is you know that

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,639
is impossible um we are all human beings

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,279
and bias even in its most innocuous form

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,639
is just how how we go about things so if

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,800
you're open to that and

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,920
you kind of take that as you know a

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,399
nugget

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,760
um then we can start to talk about okay

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,279
well what does that mean it was the

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,519
implication of that

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,760
especially when we talk about the mental

00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:01,200
model of circle of competence

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,399
um focusing on all right well if i have

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,920
biases

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,279
are the actions that i'm doing focusing

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,600
on being right and confirming those

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,880
biases or am i doing things again to

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,880
focus on being successful

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,519
all right

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,000
two more definitions though i want to

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,880
add to this piece again

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,720
because you know we are technologists

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,000
and i want to make sure that we have the

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,160
right terminology because we all know

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,639
terminology is really important

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:33,040
in our world the first is perspective

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,880
and perspective what that means is you

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,760
know how you kind of look at a problem

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,880
um common perspectives come from

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,279
imitation

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,560
right so when you're a part of a group

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,360
you know your perspective

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,720
is informed by what others in that group

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,040
have done so if you live in a different

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,120
part of the world and you have different

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,959
you know customs you notice those

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,959
customs and your perspective is shaped

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,959
by that so you just kind of imitate what

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,040
you've learned and that and that's okay

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,399
um your perspective also comes from the

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,760
need to communicate

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,160
the fact that you're trying to make

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,320
connections with another person right so

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,440
it's hard sometimes to connect or

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,800
communicate with people

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,560
if you can't come from the same

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,079
perspective or at least communicate from

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,680
a similar perspective

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,760
and a lot of times when you're

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,120
surrounded by

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,399
a certain group of people for a long

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,320
period of time whether it's where you

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,880
live where you work et cetera

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,560
you tend to adopt or absorb those

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,440
perspectives because again you want to

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,120
communicate where

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,360
we're social beings that's how we get

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,800
things done and the other thing is

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,040
you know we just have this natural

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,800
desire to conform um

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,639
you try to find your tribe you've heard

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,600
it as tribalism but even in the most

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,320
innocuous kind of

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,800
definitions right your perspective is

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,920
shaped

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,360
by this desire to feel comfortable and

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,560
that's okay too but i think it's just

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,120
important to note

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,160
what perspective is and and the most

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,399
important thing

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,120
again is it's it's how you look at a

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,480
problem that's what perspective is

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,519
the second thing we want to kind of talk

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,160
about is heuristic

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,920
and heuristic is how you end up

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,839
searching for a solution

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,199
right so you know in the most simplest

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,880
terms if you are

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,639
a farmer and the problem

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,160
and the perspective that you have has

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,040
been through the farm

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,320
and you know you you're familiar with

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,000
you know heavy machinery

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:25,680
or planting or raising livestock etc

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,759
then if you have a problem such as

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:33,279
you know hey i have a leaky faucet or um

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:36,560
i you know um i'm trying to

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,800
make my my child feel better um

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,839
the way that i would solve that solution

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,920
or the way that i would solve that

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,120
problem is likely going to be informed

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,959
by not only my perspective but you know

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,399
the context of where i came so how i

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,880
search for that solution is

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,720
is definitely going to influence you

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,560
know ultimately where i come to

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,000
um why is that important it's important

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,519
because when we think about

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,639
our open source communities and i

00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,839
apologize i don't know why keeps going

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,040
back that way

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,720
when you think about our open source

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,480
communities right we have to be

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,440
cognizant of the fact that different

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,519
perspectives

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,959
ultimately come to different conclusions

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,800
and so again

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,320
focusing on the idea of what success

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,079
looks like can

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,920
help us kind of work through the and

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,120
respect the fact that everyone has kind

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,240
of a different perspective a different

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,959
heuristic when they're approaching

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,959
different problems

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,880
and so come some quick stories in

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,240
science that that reinforces point

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,360
um you know back in the 1930s there was

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,120
a farmer who

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,720
you know was trying to figure out why

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,519
their calf kept getting sick

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,160
and it turns out that this particular

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,279
calf

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,000
um on their farm was eating

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,800
um a bunch of clovers um you know little

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
little clover

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,560
plants and um when

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,839
he went to um an animal doctor and took

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,839
took his calf to animal doctor

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,639
what they found was that these clovers

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,800
have a byproduct called uh

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,720
coumarin which essentially thins the

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,480
blood and because the calf kept eating

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,920
the clovers you know their blood was

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,600
thinning and they were you know had low

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,480
blood pressure and it ultimately kind of

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,520
affected the cats

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,799
the cats of the calf's um health

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:15,600
um what was interesting

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,880
about that man this thing is really kind

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,280
of sensitive what's interesting about

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,039
that

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:24,160
is um that innovation

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,799
even though it took 40 years right was

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,240
discovered within the context of farming

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,320
and started with

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,000
you know a cafe being sick but it

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,160
ultimately ended up being a key

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,080
ingredient something called coumadin

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,960
which is a blood thinner which

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,440
second to you know penicillin has been

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,880
the

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,480
central drug that has saved the most

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,880
people in this world

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,520
right and again what this story sort of

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,720
illustrates

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,720
is this idea that you know

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,280
when you approach different problems

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,240
when you have different problems with a

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,600
new perspective

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,400
and a new heuristic it can be repurposed

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,520
and reused to maybe solve existing

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,679
problems

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,559
and the only way to kind of get there is

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,720
to have

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,080
different perspectives which ultimately

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,200
inform characteristics

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,640
so a problem or a disagreement or

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,480
i don't really see that i don't

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,960
necessarily agree for one

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,280
particular person or specific group

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,640
could be an exponential solution

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,160
for different group which can ultimately

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,080
kind of help us all right and we have

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,000
these kind of scientific

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,440
stories these these facts that kind of

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,080
exist out there with one of them kind of

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,520
being the invention of blood thinners

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,640
another example and there's actually a

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,559
recent article that just kind of came

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,400
out that even changed this was

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,000
you know this picture right here so for

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
the longest time for those who are old

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
enough

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,320
this is how we were taught you know um

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,120
reproduction happens you have this idea

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,280
that

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,640
you know you you have a single sperm

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,480
that um

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,160
impregnates an egg and that sperm is the

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,400
one that won and it you know

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,240
dominated all the other sperm and so you

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,679
know the the most

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,520
um the most dominant one wins and that's

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,080
that kind of frame some of our our

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,000
thinking of of how we think about

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,480
um you know what we should prize and

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,000
what we should value in our society

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,640
well it turns out you know that

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,160
once we started as a society allowing

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,559
women to become

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,559
scientists within this world the real

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,039
story actually kind of looks like this

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,840
where it's not one sperm you know kind

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,679
of

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,000
trapezing through and deciding you know

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,559
hey i'm the i'm the superior one and you

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,200
know

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,880
i'm the one that made it the the actual

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,000
real picture is more something like this

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,640
where you have

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,280
um an egg and the egg actually chooses

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,440
from

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,280
you know um a plethora of lots of

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,919
different sperm that end up making it

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,440
and again that just changed how we

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,720
taught health

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,720
and part of that was because um

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,320
you had different perspectives in the

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,679
field of science

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,600
right to take a deeper look at

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,720
something with a different perspective

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,640
different heuristic

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,960
to literally change our understanding of

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,600
how reproduction works

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,159
and again it's just one of those things

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,559
where

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,679
you know i'm reinforcing this idea that

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,799
that that

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,880
that different perspectives and

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:18,240
different heuristic have already proven

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,000
and already kind of move us forward

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,600
from our neutral inert you know a

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,919
neutral inertia state

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,880
to our growth state how we learn how we

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,679
how we you know

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,679
learn new things

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,919
all right so what does that really mean

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,440
for

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,760
your team your community right because

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,440
i'm sure you already sort of feel like

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,400
well the people we already have

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,000
you know are good enough um my team our

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,880
community already has superheroes we're

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,760
doing pretty good and that may be true

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,919
right

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,039
you may feel comfortable with the folks

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,039
that

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,559
you already engage with there's nothing

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,039
wrong with that

00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:00,720
i think again what we're sort of trying

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,720
to talk about today is

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,600
given what currently exists

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:10,799
in your current kind of context

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,799
what does that mean to

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,640
include more folks and to make sure that

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,760
you actually want to run towards making

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,400
sure you know diversity is a big part of

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,840
of your experiences every day so the

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,520
first thing we want to kind of do is

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,039
make sure we understand what diversity

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,039
is in general because i think it gets

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,520
oversimplified

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,440
the first thing to kind of know about

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,760
the definition of diversity is that it's

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,600
not

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,679
simple it actually is very fluid and

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,400
there are different types of diversity

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,480
right so the one that typically is

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,440
brought up and is used as almost like a

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,520
cudgel

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,120
depending upon whether you're pro or i

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,679
don't know if you're against but just

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,480
you know let's just say argue its

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,080
priority

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,080
is demographic diversity right these are

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,600
things that we see someone's gender

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,559
someone's race

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,520
um someone's sexual orientation these

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,280
are identities

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,679
right these are these are identities of

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,960
origin they're things that

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,280
most of the time people can't really

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,480
control others how they're born it's

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,640
something that sticks with them for the

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,799
rest of their life

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,799
and that's again that's just one part of

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,400
what we're talking about

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,159
another is something called experiential

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,559
diversity right and this

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,080
is based on um and this this kind of

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,840
comes from

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,640
what our groups are what our affinities

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,120
are um what our hobbies are

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,880
things that nature um and this is more

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,480
organic

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:37,120
there isn't really um

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,080
you know defined by others that you kind

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,880
of get to define

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,080
what your experiences are um and and

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,679
that's really important you know the

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,440
fact that that we're all kind of

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,440
associated and a part of the fedora

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,720
community is one of those examples of

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,960
experiential diversity right i

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,480
choosing to be a part of this group um

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,000
i've organically kind of found this and

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,039
i want to be involved and that's

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
that's a great thing too and the last

00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,600
thing

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,240
that you've probably heard of before is

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,840
something called cognitive diversity

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,520
and unfortunately in this day and time

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,480
it's kind of used as a weapon against

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,840
the first one

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,679
anytime we talk about diversity

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,200
sometimes people use the idea of

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,880
cognitive diversity to say well that's

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,280
what's more important

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,799
than demographic diversity and cognitive

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,440
diversity is really about

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,280
again how we approach problems it's

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,880
really you're trying to parse

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:27,280
people's perspective and heuristic and

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,720
the the the point is that you're you're

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,840
trying to say well as long as people

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,039
think differently

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,799
then that's what's important i don't

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,559
want to necessarily focus on how they

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,640
look etc

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,640
and a lot of times what's involved with

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,840
cognitive diversity

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,520
is this aspirational concept that

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,760
you know i'm different and i have this

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,640
different identity and again that's okay

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,279
i just

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,720
the goal of this this slide is really

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,960
for you to understand

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,880
that it's not a singular thing diversity

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,520
is a fluid concept

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,000
and it's just used as a classification

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,240
um

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,679
to take something very complex and kind

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,159
of try to simplify it

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,080
but the more you understand that the

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,760
idea of diversity is not

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,120
a simple concept that it's a fluid thing

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,039
and there's all different types

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,400
the more you can maybe hopefully be open

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,799
to

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,080
some of the the scientific facts kind of

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,440
rooted within within its premise

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,159
the other thing that i want to kind of

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,039
stress is again one is not better than

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,600
the other

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,880
and it's in its you know again if we

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,640
focus on

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,159
trying to be successful and what success

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,000
looks like as a community

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,080
we can kind of appreciate all of their

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,159
different um

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,159
their value points as we kind of work

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:42,080
through the challenges that we have

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:45,520
together all right

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,039
the other part that's just kind of

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,559
out there but i think kind of gets

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,039
overlooked when we talk about these

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:53,120
things

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:54,880
is you know the science of biology

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,320
right and evolution in general

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,480
biodiversity

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,000
right we kind of sort of know this but i

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,039
don't think we take that concept

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
and really kind of bring it into

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,360
this conversation so this picture right

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,840
what you're looking at is obviously a

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,840
frog

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,440
and what's interesting about the concept

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,320
of biodiversity and just evolution in

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,480
general is

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,400
it's it's it's a scientific norm we kind

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,440
of agree

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,520
and understand you know that if

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,000
different animals don't evolve as things

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,440
change

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,600
you know those particular types of

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,799
species will die off right

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,480
it's proven in the concept of you know a

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,760
frog with a sticky tongue

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,080
and an insect with a slippery body if

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,000
a particular species of frog doesn't

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,360
continue to change and adapt

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,360
to have a more stickier tongue and

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,880
you know the the food that it relies on

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,159
let's just say these particular insects

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,480
do evolve

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,679
um with a more slippery body than that

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,039
particular species

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,919
you know will likely not continue to

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,760
survive

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,840
the same is true for the insect as well

00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,159
so they kind of play off of each other

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,440
um but we know through evolution right

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,240
that

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,720
the cross pollenization the idea that

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,000
you know

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,880
the sharing of in this case just dna

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,200
strands

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,400
create different types of you know

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,559
species

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,320
and the different factors that are

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,080
brought in from that perspective

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,679
ultimately create a different context

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,919
for both of these species to live and

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,840
the cycle just kind of keeps continuing

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,679
and again what i'm trying to stress here

00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,840
is this idea that at the end of the day

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,360
like momentum is going to keep going and

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,480
we constantly have to kind of you know

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,400
continuously evolve

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,840
um and so there's there's there's some

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,360
truth here um with this kind of example

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,440
so let's kind of go to star trek and for

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,559
those who may be a little disappointed i

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,240
am going to talk about

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,159
star trek voyager instead of deep space

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,640
nine or the next generation

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,480
um but essentially what was interesting

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,159
about star trek voyager

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,799
was the fact that um in this case it was

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,080
the first

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,880
you know star trek that had um a woman

00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,960
as a captain

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,880
in a major you know television series

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,799
which sounds kind of weird now in 2020

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,799
but at the time it was you know very

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,159
you know progressive and and a little

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,240
bit earth shattering

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,520
but the premise of the the of this

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,600
particular um

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,039
show was this idea that you had kind of

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,360
these two factions

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,080
um a rebel faction and starfleet and

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,399
essentially

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,000
those different people were thrust

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:22,559
together in a impossible

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
situation where they were thrown 70 000

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,600
light years from the alpha quadrant and

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,200
they basically had to

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,760
get through their differences adapt

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,000
their differences in order to eventually

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,080
figure out how to get back home together

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,440
so this is this concept that

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,120
all these different perspectives people

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,200
with different points of view who

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,039
actually were warring against each other

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,640
now are in a situation where they have

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,640
to figure out how to be successful

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,240
and the first character you know that

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,000
was

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,000
really important was you know captain

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,360
janeway for those who have seen

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,640
this picture before you're probably

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,919
thinking isn't that the person from

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,360
orange is the new black

00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,600
and the answer is yes this is kate

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,080
mulgrew but in this particular concept

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,159
um we're really talking about um a

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,880
character who was bullheaded

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,679
who was very stubborn who was curious

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,200
you know

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,360
constantly cured she was a scientist by

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,120
nature but she was also a leader

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,799
and as a leader you know she had her

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,520
sayings the fact that she wanted to keep

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,840
things

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,120
you know you know uniform but she was

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,960
fiercely lawyer to her

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,240
fiercely loyal to her crew and that was

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,799
really important again

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,720
as she she thought about it given the

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,200
deficit of success success in this case

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,960
was

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,520
getting back home and we all had to kind

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,960
of you know be there together

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,960
and one of the things as a leader that i

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,960
think is really important when you're

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,399
trying to figure these things out is the

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,840
question you know are you open to

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,720
unorthodox thinking

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,559
unorthodox um concepts and this is where

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,919
we start to introduce some some newer

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,240
things right so

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,720
this uh this difference in this this uh

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,240
comparison between kind of two things

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,880
iq and eq so a lot we're familiar with

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,559
iq

00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,000
um you know your intelligence close in

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:01,679
and and that really focuses

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,200
on your ability to learn something not

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,640
necessarily what you know

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,399
but think about the difference between

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,399
velocity acceleration right

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,640
um what is the pace at which you learn

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,480
new things what's interesting about iq

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,120
is that it really doesn't change

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,399
um after a certain age it's just kind of

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,840
one of those fixed things which i have

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,640
iq scores and i think that's one of

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,120
those things that

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,640
we as society really kind of over index

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,159
on

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,080
we have this other concept though called

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,039
eq which is really about

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,919
um emotional intelligence or emotional

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,679
quotient

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,440
and what that is is that it's your

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,000
ability to recognize

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,279
not only someone else's emotions but

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,279
also your own

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,960
right and what's great about eq is that

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,399
it's not fixed it changes over time it's

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,679
something you can constantly

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:47,360
improve upon why is this important

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,039
because if you understand the difference

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,159
between the two then you're able to kind

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,960
of again separate

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,640
and really and try to really hone in on

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,399
okay

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,159
when things break down when we're trying

00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,960
to have conversations when we're trying

00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,279
to again

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,000
get to whatever success metric we are as

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,440
a team as an open source society

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,120
what are the things that are the most

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,799
important and what are the things that i

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,880
can be doing to make sure that we you

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:13,440
know kind of get there is it about just

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,640
having really smart people who can solve

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,279
problems really quickly

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,399
or is it about or and i can say or but

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,640
and

00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,919
is it about folks who you know feel this

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,200
sense that it's really important for

00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,640
people to feel welcome that

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,480
you know they recognize what different

00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,039
emotions are recognize different biases

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,039
etc

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,760
especially within a group context it

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,799
turns out that there's a bunch of

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,399
studies that basically

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:40,720
have proven that the efficacy of a group

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,559
is actually more dependent upon

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,159
the group's emotional intelligence of

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,559
its individual members than it's you

00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,919
know the individual iq of each member

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,520
and the teams that actually develop

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,000
great emotional intelligence booster

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,919
overall

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,919
performance again going towards success

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,399
and what's interesting about these

00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:02,480
particular studies

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:04,480
is that there are certain concepts that

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,159
reinforce this point so the fact that

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,840
the members amongst that community or

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,240
that team feel like they can trust each

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,600
other

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,519
the fact that they have a sense of group

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,000
identity the fact that they feel that

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,000
they're

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,440
you know um that they can get things

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,440
done as a group

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,960
becomes a really important part of the

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,960
success of that group

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,480
and you know as i've learned more about

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,799
the fedora community the fact that you

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,840
know

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:28,240
you we have these um you know

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,720
really rapid release cycles that we're

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,720
focusing on you know

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,080
user experience in terms of you know the

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,760
way the website looks and the mission

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,240
that's projected out there

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,640
um you know i was looking at some of the

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,399
sessions yesterday and and listening to

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,679
you know um the fact that we're making

00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,600
it easier for certain things to be

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,240
deprecated for certain packages to be

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,519
you know to kind of be let go how we're

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,120
changing how we're you know we're doing

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,559
authentication mechanisms

00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,799
with kerberos like all those different

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,760
things right are our reinforcement of

00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,640
the fact that

00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,360
the group as a whole is focused on

00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,440
success

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,120
and people when people feel like that

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,640
they can be a part of that group that

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,760
they get are trusted as

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,519
a great member then those success

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,559
metrics those things that we all kind of

00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,080
want to happen are

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,679
are increased and that's really

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,000
important and it really goes to the

00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,600
heart

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,080
of the fact that um in order to get

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,679
there you

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,159
actually have to focus on your emotions

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,919
you have to be able to focus on

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,360
the ability to listen to make people

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,320
feel like they're included things of

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,519
that nature

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,840
all right let's go to our second

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:35,360
character uh tuvak

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:37,200
tuvak was um is a vulcan and for those

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,960
who are unfamiliar with kind of the star

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,279
trek ecosystem

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,120
um you know it was bandied about i guess

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,559
it may be more of a fan fiction kind of

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,200
thing that that vulcans

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,000
were essentially the um evolution of

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,919
human beings

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,519
you know far into the future they could

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,320
live you know three four hundred years

00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,440
old

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,559
um they were devoid of a lot of you know

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,080
kind of emotional

00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,600
you know kind of trenches they really

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,519
focused on logic

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,519
um they tried to remain calm but they

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,799
had a lot of different rituals that they

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,760
went through to you know really center

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,279
their society

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:14,640
on the um

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:17,200
over reliance i guess of of logic

00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,480
and their kind of modus operandi was we

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,039
want to keep peace

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,519
you know through wisdom experience and

00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:25,840
vitality

00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,200
um what was interesting about the

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,760
character within

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,320
again the context of of what voyager was

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,240
going through

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,960
because remember you know there they

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,399
were thrust 70 000 light years away from

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,720
their home

00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:41,200
and they're all trying to figure out

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,440
different ways to kind of get back there

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,320
um tuvox roll was was very interesting

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,960
because

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,039
as a vulcan he always appeared calm he

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,399
always appeared like he was unflappable

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,679
in all the different challenges that

00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,919
they have

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,080
and he would constantly remind you know

00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:59,200
his teammates that

00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,960
um you know just because something looks

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,399
like it's easy doesn't mean it is

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,720
right that um the fact that

00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,840
you know you can see it doesn't

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,399
necessarily mean that it's going to be

00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,960
easy

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,280
to solve and a lot of times i think this

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,520
manifests itself in this idea

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,639
that when we have you know disagreements

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,200
or when we're trying to work through

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,320
things

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,599
we tend to try to you know kind of push

00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,359
back on each other and say well what is

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:27,200
the logical solution what is the thing

00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:30,240
that just makes sense to me um

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,919
and when you focus on this

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,440
thing your perspective and kind of

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:34,800
validate your perspective and say well

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,000
this just kind of quote-unquote makes

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,839
sense to me

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,440
you tend to kind of get into this area

00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,119
where you break down

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,520
the effectiveness of the group because

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,000
the individual

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,599
gratification becomes you know paramount

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,879
and there's a bunch of studies that have

00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,720
shown you know that

00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,879
the most important thing when people

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,079
feel like that

00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,839
that was a group that they want to be a

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,440
part of is not necessarily that that

00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,440
individual person

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,800
was you know really really smart or that

00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,520
they just admire that person

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,480
but the fact that they felt hurt um and

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,160
and that's

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,599
you know may seem straightforward but it

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,320
is something that's a little bit

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,440
hard to do um especially when we all you

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,400
know are very bright and we have

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,760
different perspectives

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,960
you know as necessary and this is where

00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,680
we kind of get into

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,720
some again some more realities out there

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,760
so

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,640
what i'm kind of focusing on here is the

00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,920
fact that

00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,200
you know there's been a bunch of social

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,040
studies

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,640
and the ones that i'm referencing and

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,000
again i apologize to

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,079
the members of the community who

00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,119
identify as non-binary what i'm really

00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,520
trying to

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,720
communicate here is the studies that

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,000
i've kind of looked at are

00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,240
have focused on you know the binary uh

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,119
the genders in this case but but the

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,880
overarching

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:54,480
idea is this idea that

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:57,280
there had there have been correlations

00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,040
to the gender identities of the team

00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,079
members and the effectiveness of those

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,200
teams

00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,440
i'm not saying there's a direct

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,960
causation but there's a high correlation

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,280
to the number of women within a

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,880
particular group

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,800
as it relates to the effectiveness of

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,800
that group and

00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,000
even though we know that gender is not

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,680
limited to two choices

00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,839
i just think it's a really interesting

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,400
kind of scientific point

00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:22,240
to point out that correlation because

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,680
again

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,000
we're trying to get to success we're

00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,079
trying to to validate and and

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,480
try to have these conversations with

00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,560
each other to really focus on

00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,160
how should we understand you know the

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,240
different types of diversity the

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,800
fluidity of how diversity is defined

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,320
while also looking at you know the

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,079
rigorous scientific studies that have

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,760
existed to say okay how do we get just

00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,880
because what what have other successful

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,760
groups done

00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,160
and so again the the key factors here

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,480
are

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,760
group satisfaction group cohesion and

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,400
group motivation

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,680
um and and and there's there's a

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,040
correlation here that i think is really

00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,520
really interesting and i would

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,200
i would and um encourage everyone to

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,680
kind of keep exploring you know

00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:07,359
that part um

00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,880
obviously this is kind of manifested in

00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,079
different ways i'm if you haven't seen

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,760
this comic before i think

00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:15,839
it's a really interesting um kind of

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,599
perspective in this argument right so

00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:22,400
this this idea

00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:24,160
that even though um

00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,760
i may have a particular perspective and

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,720
i'm surrounded by people who share that

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,400
perspective

00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,880
right this is this comic is obviously an

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,320
exaggeration of that reality

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,480
right but it's still an important

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,480
concept this idea that

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,280
in order for us to be more effective as

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,000
a group we have to be open-minded to

00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,680
um you know the differences the

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,599
different perspectives you know and the

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,119
way that diversity is defined

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,520
so which can ultimately lead to the

00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,000
question why is that the case why do

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,119
diverse

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,079
teams outperform teams that are not

00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,640
and there's a couple of things that kind

00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,720
of come

00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,000
out of this the first is when you're in

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,880
a team with different

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,079
people i'm just to kind of oversimplify

00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,079
right

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,440
the members tend to then focus on the

00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,520
facts of what the person is saying

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,680
because they're not necessarily looking

00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:15,200
to um blend their perspective into kind

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,440
of the group's social majority

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,400
right if i'm in a group where a bunch of

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,400
people are kind of

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,839
maybe have similar kind of backgrounds

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,359
perspectives etc

00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,359
then i tend to i necessarily don't want

00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:27,440
to upset the apple cart right

00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,720
so but if we're in a team where

00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,480
different perspectives exist

00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,440
you tend to want to parse what that

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,720
person is saying a little bit more

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,200
careful about what they're saying and

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,400
you

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,720
process what they're saying a little bit

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,720
more which means that the ideas

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,920
that have gone through the scrutiny tend

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,359
to kind of float to the top

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,359
and those are the ones that ultimately

00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,720
you know can lead to the success of that

00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,920
group which is really interesting

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,480
the other thing that kind of comes out

00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,200
of this is those different perspectives

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,119
initially

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,800
you know create more innovation right

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,359
you

00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,200
tend to just kind of dodge those

00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:59,440
pitfalls of conformity

00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,960
and because again everyone is different

00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,400
everyone has

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,640
a different way of how they're looking

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,760
at it so it's not really to conform to

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:10,160
and typically when you are if i'm sure

00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,359
you probably have this experience if you

00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,960
are in a group where you're trying to

00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,480
conform you're trying to appease or try

00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,200
not to upset the apple cart

00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,400
you tend to maybe hold back um you're

00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,680
not able to kind of push through that

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,400
different innovation

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,200
um so there are there is evidence of why

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,880
why this is

00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,960
why this is the case that different

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,400
diverse teams outperform in it and

00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,560
again if you kind of think about it you

00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,079
probably know that you know you

00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,920
can kind of identify with some of these

00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,359
you know bullet points

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,359
which kind of leads me to my first bold

00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,839
statement right there's really no such

00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,000
thing as

00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,839
as common sense common sense reinforces

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,200
this idea that there is a quote-unquote

00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:44,640
common

00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,560
perspective that everyone should just

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,920
kind of know and

00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,040
if you maybe disabuse yourself of that

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,560
notion

00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,640
right you can maybe kind of open up your

00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,599
mind and say well if i let go of the

00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,839
idea that's

00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,119
that that there is a common perspective

00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,160
and actually everyone has a different

00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,160
perspective

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,680
and those perspectives are informed by

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,240
not only their demographics but also

00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:09,359
their experiences

00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:11,760
then i can start asking the question

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:12,480
how do i weave and include those

00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,240
different

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,000
experiences and different conclusions to

00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,359
ultimately get to the success of our

00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,680
group and ultimately get to where we're

00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:22,319
trying to go what could i be doing

00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,520
to facilitate that that conversation

00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:27,599
that innovation

00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:30,160
or even asking another question are we

00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,119
do we have a community that facilitates

00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,640
that

00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,720
you know if i look around again just

00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:38,240
demographically and i and i don't

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,520
see people who again from the

00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,240
demographic diversity perspective

00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,599
that don't look like me you know are we

00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,920
actually

00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:48,800
able to get the most innovative you know

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,800
kind of conclusion

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,839
uh the next character in the series is

00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,880
is is the the chief security officer

00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,640
bolano torres

00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,839
uh what was interesting about you know

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:03,920
her character um within the series was

00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:07,040
she um was half human and half klingon

00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,640
um she was very tough very brash

00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,640
um she was driven driven by a

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,040
combination of

00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,680
this innate sense of honor right from

00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,480
her kind of

00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,160
her klingon culture but also guilt from

00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,960
the fact that you know she was a human

00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,560
being

00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,359
but also her tenacity and what those

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,720
kind of things kind of bring together

00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,480
um one of the things she kind of talked

00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,599
about was you know she wants to

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,560
constantly feel things

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,560
right she wants to have these

00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,119
experiences that feel things and i think

00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,520
the

00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,880
the big lesson that comes out of this is

00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,359
you know how do you evaluate

00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,560
how do you evaluate talent how do you to

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:41,520
be quite honest judge

00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,720
others right sometimes we tend to be

00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,880
defensive

00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,000
when someone is coming from perspective

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,119
or has an experience that's different

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,880
than ours and then they

00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,640
and and they project that experience

00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,119
through how they communicate

00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,040
um and a lot of times you may miss the

00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:58,160
potential of that person because

00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,680
of that defensiveness um one of the

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,079
books that that really kind of speak to

00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,560
this

00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:06,640
is uh one from uh professor scott page

00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,880
what's interesting about him is that he

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,480
kind of blends the idea of complex

00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,680
systems math as well as political

00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,960
science and economics

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,200
and i encourage you all to kind of take

00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,079
a look at that but essentially what he

00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,480
kind of revealed

00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,440
is that progress and innovation may

00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,079
depend less

00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,880
on really again like lone brilliant

00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,680
thinkers

00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,520
with enormous iqs and really kind of

00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,400
depends on diverse people having the

00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,800
ability and

00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,920
and the and the opportunity to

00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,160
capitalize

00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,680
on their specific individuality right

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,520
the fact that they come to a particular

00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,520
situation different than others

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,280
is there a medium is there a space for

00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,079
them to capitalize on that unique

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,079
perspective

00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:46,560
to contribute to the to the to the

00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,560
bigger goal

00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,880
one of the kind of phrases that are

00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,680
thrown out there

00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,240
to really kind of blunt this reality is

00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,880
this

00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,640
this this phrase of well i just want to

00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,160
hire the most qualified person i just

00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,520
want the most qualified

00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,960
thing and there's really nothing wrong

00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,640
inherently with that question but there

00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,680
is something that's being missed

00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,560
and the part that's being missed that's

00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,000
in that statement

00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:17,040
is okay how do you

00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,720
individually define most qualified

00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:22,640
and are you recognizing

00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,760
the perspective and heuristic that

00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,520
you're bringing to

00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:30,640
answer that specific question and is

00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:33,920
that perspective and heuristic limited

00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:40,079
to write your own experiences

00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:42,880
um in your own you know kind of piece

00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,720
again what is your perspective and

00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,800
heuristic right which kind of leads to

00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,800
the second bold statement of

00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:55,359
you have to change your perspective

00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,319
to arrive at a new heuristic right and

00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:00,160
remember heuristic

00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:02,160
is how we solve problems

00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,520
so in order to solve a problem that's

00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,720
entrenched we actually change our

00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,599
perspective

00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,000
and the only way to change our

00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:10,319
perspective is to

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,920
right include different perspectives and

00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,560
when we do that we ultimately get to

00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,280
something which

00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:17,839
we all want something called right

00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,280
innovation

00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,280
so what are some examples of when that

00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,040
doesn't happen right

00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,960
people have called it or branded

00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,560
innovation but technically

00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,000
probably wasn't right what what are

00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,440
those fails what does that look like and

00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,280
we when we have real-world examples of

00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,760
what that is

00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,960
the first is you know the drug ambien

00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,400
when ambient was first

00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,040
introduced when they were doing drug

00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,079
trials instead of actually testing

00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:43,280
different dosages

00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:45,839
with with women they just assumed

00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,319
that smaller men were good enough and

00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:51,520
they ended up having a recall because

00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:53,040
that wasn't the case how

00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,240
how did they how do people who are

00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,960
brilliant that come up with different

00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,119
drugs not

00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,560
kind of see that obviousness and again

00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,400
right the perspective

00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,400
probably you know was very similar there

00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,319
wasn't a different perspective say hey

00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,640
maybe we probably shouldn't do this

00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:08,160
um another quote-unquote innovation that

00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,599
was out there when apple first revealed

00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,000
their health kit when it was first

00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,119
introduced into the world you know seven

00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,200
or eight years ago

00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:17,680
it was branded as a new revolution in

00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,839
how we track our health

00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,520
what was interesting about that

00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:23,119
announcement at the time was i didn't

00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,599
have period tracking

00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,359
and so how is it that something that

00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,880
supposedly revolutionary innovation

00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:31,359
somehow excludes half

00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,000
the world's population to something that

00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,319
just you know

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,520
happens naturally and and is a key part

00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,800
of you know

00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:40,079
um our biology how you can be innovative

00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,839
while excluding half

00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:43,599
the world i'm not necessarily sure how

00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:46,960
that's possible but

00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,240
again if you don't have different

00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,640
perspectives

00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,160
um to come to different heuristics you

00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,440
may have what's called false innovation

00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,720
right you may

00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,560
be think you may think you have

00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,839
something that's great but it could be

00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:01,359
missing something you know that

00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:03,200
that's very very large um the same is

00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:04,160
true for the institutions that we lod

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,560
right

00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,599
what's interesting about you know

00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,480
harvard's

00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,040
admission practices is that as much as

00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,359
you know

00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,520
it's been lauded as this great you know

00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:17,920
place and i'm not saying it's not

00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,760
as it was investigated and and went

00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,359
deeper into how they actually admit

00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,520
their students it turns out that you

00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,920
know 40 of the folks admitted to harvard

00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,560
were

00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,680
just come from people who had went to

00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,720
harvard before

00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,800
so it wasn't necessarily that the the

00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,160
most brilliant people are the ones who

00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,119
get in

00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,920
you know the innovative process the

00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,680
innovation that's

00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,119
typically associated with a top tier

00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,800
university actually

00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,000
may not necessarily be as innovative as

00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,599
it could be because their current

00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,040
practices are we just want

00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,200
the same perspectives kind of over and

00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,599
over again based on how we you know

00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,280
um admit people into this particular

00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,040
institution

00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,800
and my last one which i've always just

00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,960
kind of found shocking

00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,400
and i'm sure um those in the audience

00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,440
who identify as women kind of know what

00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,119
i'm talking about

00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,720
is i've never really understood and i

00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:06,800
didn't know the fact that you know the

00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:10,400
fashion industry has really focused

00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:12,960
you know for for the longest time on

00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,319
the visual appeal of their clothes

00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,560
versus the function

00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:17,839
of you know just kind of living simpler

00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,400
and easier lives and so

00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:22,000
there's this whole kind of thing within

00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,079
women's fashion

00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,680
that there are a bunch of closers not

00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:28,079
made with pockets

00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,839
and as a heterosexual man it just kind

00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,119
of mystifies me because i don't

00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,480
understand how

00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,720
you know in all the innovations that

00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,400
exist within our world how we can kind

00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,520
of continue down this thread of

00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:42,160
you know um

00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,680
kind of denying the most kind of basic

00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,920
you know essential kind of tool

00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,359
that is associated with our clothing um

00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,440
but for whatever reason that just it

00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:51,520
just it just has not been a part of

00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,800
you know what's kind of going on so i

00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,240
know i'm running out of time and kind of

00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,200
kind of go through these last little

00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,440
points

00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,839
um the last kind of character will will

00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,720
kind of talk about seven of nine

00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:04,079
seven of nine was a character that um

00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,920
was both

00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,280
borg and human she was an assimilated

00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,359
human borg

00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,040
is um is a really interesting kind of

00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,680
concept of itself can probably be its

00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,359
own talk

00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,280
but essentially the borg was this race

00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:16,480
that essentially assimilated every

00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,760
particular species

00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,760
thought that they could be a superior

00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,760
species by taking the best parts in

00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,520
their minds the best part of a species

00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,440
assimilating that into their giant kind

00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,800
of hive mind and then discarding the

00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,400
rest

00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,400
what was interesting about 79's

00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,960
character is that she constantly

00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,760
you know kind of dismissed all the

00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,000
different human

00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,760
aspects of her team because she thought

00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,280
they were irrelevant

00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,680
and the allegory here is that that's

00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,240
sometimes similar to what we do with

00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,280
each other

00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,599
right when we're in a technical

00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,720
community and we want to talk about

00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,240
you know different ideas different

00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,880
concepts we tend to want to dismiss

00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,040
those things

00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,400
as not being relevant maybe political or

00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,480
whatever that is

00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,240
and um i think there's a kind of a

00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,599
broader concept here that we need to

00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:02,800
be open to which is you know

00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:04,880
what is it exactly that

00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,800
make someone care because if i if you

00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,319
introduce this concept into

00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,920
you know this this realm that i

00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:12,720
necessarily want to be in

00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,839
um you know this technical realm and i

00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:17,359
don't necessarily agree with that

00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:19,119
then um people who are like me won't

00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:20,480
care about this anymore so therefore we

00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,160
should introduce these concepts because

00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,520
i don't think this is important

00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,200
so the first question we need to ask

00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,880
ourselves is what does make someone care

00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,280
and it really just kind of comes down to

00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,680
you know four simple concepts vanity

00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,000
right how does it make me look

00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,599
virtue how does it make the world better

00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,800
and those two things are you know very

00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,240
powerful

00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,520
but there's really kind of two things

00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,640
that i really want to focus on and i

00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,800
think it's really important for

00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:44,000
for for our community to focus on to

00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,920
really understand

00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,920
that drive people in a particular

00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,599
direction especially when we talk about

00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,079
trying to get to successful

00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,359
inclusive community and that's fear and

00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:56,319
profit

00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:58,079
right when we talk about the challenges

00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:00,240
that we have as a fedora community

00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,240
bringing in younger contributors

00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,800
improving the user experience

00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,920
making our documentation uh more easily

00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,480
searchable usable

00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,480
so that people can onboard faster right

00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,440
we want to make sure that we focus

00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,400
and we focus our energies to these last

00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,640
two things

00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,720
right how do we unpack what people are

00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,240
afraid of these differences

00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,880
and what would it mean if we are

00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:25,599
successful i mean imagine a world

00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,119
right what would it mean if a door is

00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,640
more widely used and

00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:31,040
a lot more context does that mean more

00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,559
jobs does that mean more prosperity does

00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:35,040
that mean more innovative

00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,240
um you know features does that mean a

00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,839
more open world

00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,839
right how do we get there how do we

00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:41,839
profit from that particular idea

00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:47,119
so now we need to go into the math of

00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:49,119
what of how we get there

00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,240
and the last thing i'm going to

00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:53,760
introduce as

00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:56,480
as i kind of wrap up is this idea of

00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,920
the diversity trump's ability theorem

00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,960
and this particular theorem is

00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:03,440
derived from a specific paper but it

00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,280
does require certain conditions

00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,200
the first is that the problem must be

00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,200
hard right

00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:11,119
each solver who's trying to solve this

00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,559
problem must have their own kind of

00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:14,240
local optima to that problem

00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:16,400
i.e you know some sort of expertise

00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:18,720
within that bringing them together

00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,520
um an improvement must always be able to

00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,359
exist

00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,720
right so we're not talking about solving

00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,920
something that has a definite solution

00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,920
and that's it we're talking about a

00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,359
constantly improving thing

00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,920
and then we also need to make sure we

00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:31,119
have a large pool of solvers to have

00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,359
to have this kind of decent size

00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:36,400
collection right

00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:36,960
so if those conditions are met then the

00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,280
theorem

00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,280
holds essentially that

00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,720
diversity will always trump the

00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,400
individual ability

00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:49,440
of the members when trying to solve that

00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,440
problem it can actually be represented

00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,880
via mathematical equation and

00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:57,280
essentially what you're looking at

00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:59,200
is you have this idea that okay

00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,800
given a whole bunch of people and

00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,480
they're each making their own prediction

00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,839
of what should happen right this is when

00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,800
you're in those group conversations well

00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:05,760
i think we should do this i think we

00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,800
should do that

00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,000
right and then you kind of average the

00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,800
predictions

00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,079
of everyone right the crowd prediction

00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,760
in general

00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:17,440
the theorem essentially holds that the

00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,280
error of the crowd

00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,960
equals the average error of people in

00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:24,400
the crowd

00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,760
minus the diversity of those predictions

00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,680
so think about that for a second

00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,839
basically in order to have a more

00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,599
accurate prediction or an accurate

00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:33,839
outcome right we're talking from a math

00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:33,839
perspective

00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,680
it's the ability minus the differences

00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,160
in the categories that we create which

00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:45,280
means that if we don't create

00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:50,240
more perspectives right

00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:53,920
the difference is

00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:55,040
bigger and so the ultimate accuracy is

00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,960
smaller

00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:59,200
because the collective ability of that

00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:02,720
group

00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:04,960
is detracted from the fact of okay

00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,760
how do we take all these different

00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,119
perspectives

00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:11,520
and ultimately come to a most accurate

00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:15,760
prediction on the other side

00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:19,920
so the only way to get that collective

00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:23,760
accuracy is to have a disparate number

00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:25,359
of choices a disparate number of ideas

00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,520
that ultimately affect

00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:28,480
right the crowd's decision whereas if

00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,680
they're all coming from the same

00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:33,040
perspective

00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:35,119
right the ability to have

00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,640
a more accurate crowd prediction is

00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:39,680
decreased

00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:40,240
what's interesting about this theorem is

00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,160
that

00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,520
again this is proven this is a

00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,040
mathematically proven

00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,720
perspective right this isn't a feeling

00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,000
diversity is not a feeling this is a

00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,800
fact like it's like the pythagoras

00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,720
theorem

00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,599
right um and you can definitely take a

00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,960
look at this and look at all the

00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,079
mathematical simulations that kind of

00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,520
prove this out

00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:57,920
with any kind of theorem there's a

00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,240
counter right theorem which is great

00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,760
because

00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,920
in any type of discussion you want to be

00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,000
able to have you know um

00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,599
a countering perspective and even in

00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,480
that perspective there's a counter to

00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,000
that too so

00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,880
i encourage everyone to kind of look at

00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,599
that and look at it from again

00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,079
a curious scientific mind of you know

00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:17,119
these

00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:18,480
these particular concepts so what this

00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:20,079
model tells us

00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,319
right and the purpose of these formal

00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:24,000
models is that we want to think of

00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:25,040
people as more of like a collection of

00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,079
tools

00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:30,319
um yes we can subject them

00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:32,079
for kind of empirical testing but we can

00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:33,760
also use them to change

00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:35,599
how we think about the world right so if

00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,520
we include different perspectives

00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:39,200
we can use that as a way to kind of

00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:42,079
sharpen our ways to think about the

00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,079
world in a different way

00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:46,160
the individual's ability is a reflection

00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,240
of the applicability of those tools

00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:50,079
right given that set of problems so

00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,359
again when we talk about improving ux

00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:53,200
when we talk about in

00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:54,960
you know making documentation better

00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,319
getting young contributors into our

00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,640
ecosystem

00:54:56,319 --> 00:55:00,240
right there's this idea that the more

00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:02,400
people we include

00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,440
is actually more of like is our tool set

00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,960
robust enough

00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,119
so that we can tap into those different

00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,480
abilities to apply those tools to

00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,799
initially solve the problems that we

00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,559
have right and this is again

00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:14,720
reflected in that mathematical paper

00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:16,640
it's actually called um

00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:19,280
the hong page perspective heuristic

00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:20,400
model again which forces us to think

00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,000
about people

00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,640
as a collection of tools and their

00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:28,400
individual ability as a reflection

00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,400
of the applicability of those tools

00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:33,200
which leads me to my last bold statement

00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,799
right the pipeline problem of talent in

00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,680
a lot of places not necessarily that

00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:37,440
their

00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:39,040
town doesn't exist it's usually because

00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,119
there's not an incentive to go and

00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:42,960
discover that talent

00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:44,640
um problem solvers with diverse

00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:47,119
perspectives you know

00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:48,400
tend to have a hard time communicating

00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:51,200
with each other

00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:53,599
and so there's this kind of weird kind

00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:55,280
of feedback mechanism where

00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,880
the reason why we don't include other

00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,000
people is because it's hard to

00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,440
communicate with people who are

00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,680
different than us

00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,960
so how do you solve that problem how do

00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,359
you solve this kind of chicken and egg

00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,200
thing

00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:09,920
and the answer is right

00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,799
emotional intelligence this is kind of a

00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,880
representation

00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:14,240
of that all three of these things do the

00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,920
same thing

00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:18,559
but when you're looking at them you may

00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,079
see them as you know

00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:21,119
different ways of solving the same

00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:22,880
problem and essentially what you're

00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:25,920
looking at is a carabiner

00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,680
the first is created by a human the

00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,559
second is actually created by

00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:31,359
ai and it's 75 lighter than the first

00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:34,160
one

00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:34,799
and the third is actually an ai

00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,680
generated

00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:39,119
carabiner but it's actually 3d printed

00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,760
so even though they all solve the same

00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,480
problem

00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,440
right initially you look at them and you

00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,799
may say okay

00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,400
they're so different i don't actually

00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,839
know what they do even though they

00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,200
technically are kind of going in the

00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:52,160
same direction they all

00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,640
fulfill their definitions of success so

00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,440
again

00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:59,200
what is that tool what is that thing

00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:00,319
that will help us be more cognizant of

00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,000
different perspectives

00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:03,280
so that we can include as many people as

00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,400
possible to ultimately get to that

00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,720
success

00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,880
and again that thing that work that we

00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:11,599
need individually

00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,319
is something called eq right because if

00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:14,960
we focus

00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:15,599
on improving our emotional intelligence

00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,640
right

00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:20,000
then we can ultimately recognize

00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,760
what are the things that we're doing to

00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,400
neuter our own collective success as a

00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,319
group

00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:27,440
and how do i make sure people feel that

00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:28,640
they are a big part of this group that

00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,240
we're trying to do so that we can solve

00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,839
these bigger problems

00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,640
so my genuine hypothesis that i want to

00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:37,280
leave you with is

00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:38,880
open source will make the world better

00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:41,520
by requiring equity

00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,559
right the goal and using emotional

00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,760
intelligence

00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,920
as an integral part of its

00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,240
interoperability

00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,839
and i just you know want to make sure

00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,920
that i've connected all these ideas

00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:54,400
together because at the end of the day

00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:56,240
yes we're all technologists but us

00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,720
recognizing that there are things inside

00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,119
of us

00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:01,200
to ultimately make people feel included

00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:02,480
and and we recognize that diversity is a

00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,160
very fluid concept

00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,400
if we recognize the things that are kind

00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:08,000
of blocking us from getting there

00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,520
feeling vindicated you know feeling

00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,920
threatened those emotions that trigger

00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,799
those

00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,400
those those things that we're

00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:13,839
intelligent about that we can ultimately

00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:17,200
kind of get to that success

00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:18,319
right so how do we grow we focus on our

00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,119
mental models

00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:23,280
right we go from prove me wrong stances

00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:26,160
to what am i missing

00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,799
and we again ultimately ask ourselves

00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:30,000
okay

00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:31,440
when i'm contributing or when i'm being

00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,440
a part of this group am i focused on

00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,359
being right

00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,839
or am i focused on you know being

00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:37,839
successful

00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,760
so in conclusion the way we can solve

00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,520
difficult problems

00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,960
is we want to make sure that we look at

00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,640
people as a set of tools and the

00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,240
diversity is essentially

00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,680
the distinction of those particular

00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:52,319
tools

00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,520
and the way we can only use those

00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:55,119
particular tools that we have to

00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:57,200
efficiently collaborate and the only way

00:58:55,119 --> 00:59:00,240
to do that is to continuously develop

00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:01,680
our emotional intelligence

00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,960
there are some additional stories that i

00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,000
would love for you all to kind of take a

00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,599
look at

00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,200
to kind of look at what that

00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,720
manifestation looks like

00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,400
especially from a gendered identity

00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,000
perspective especially when we talk

00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:15,119
about including more women into

00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,240
our open source groups um

00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:17,760
but at the end of the day thank you for

00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,839
listening and i really really appreciate

00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,839
