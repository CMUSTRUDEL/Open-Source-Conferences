	00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,200
anyway

00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,639
marketing now it would be it's going to

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,920
be fun because you already

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,920
talked about this earlier

00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,880
is and i think

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,359
that there is uh i don't know how things

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,400
are and probably this session is going

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,680
to be

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,960
learning how things are currently what

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,720
we were doing back

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,399
in the day and what should be doing

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,200
because i mean

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,880
compare grow and you know succeed

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,840
something like that

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,879
uh it was really sad because at the

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,000
beginning

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:48,399
uh when i joined the fedora team i mean

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,440
a lot of years back i had to buy

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,520
everything because

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,559
i didn't even knew that there was a

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,760
sponsorship

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,520
for buying things for anything

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,079
so all the dvds and all the banners and

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,800
all of that

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,640
we have to pay it by yourself it's

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,680
really awesome that now

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,439
uh budgets for conference are really

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,640
easy

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:15,360
i think that they're too easy but

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,040
it can be less or have something that is

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,960
free design

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,439
i know that there was some effort for

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,880
the box i don't know if that

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,200
actually went through if that actually

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,560
went

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,600
through you can say that to me probably

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,159
facts yeah there was a box

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,640
somebody talked about a box uh i don't

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,320
know

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,400
i think i heard it last year or

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,119
something like that maybe it was just an

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,600
idea

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,759
yeah a box with everything that you

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,119
could need for a conference

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,040
the banners are i don't know if it was

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,560
just an idea so we used to have

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,320
something or we have

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,040
i think there's like two in existence

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,399
something called like a fedora case or

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,640
something like that

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,320
and it would have and it had like a lot

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,000
of that stuff in it

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,840
um but i don't think it was big enough

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,560
to hold a banner

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,080
yeah i mean yeah that sounds that would

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,440
be great

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,879
yeah and i said because

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,040
there's this conference order that i'm

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,640
gonna be i'm so sorry

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,959
go for it there is this uh

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,200
conference all around latin america it's

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,360
just called frisol

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,480
it's an insulfest that happens the same

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,120
day in

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,599
every single city that wants to join

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,519
there is no official sponsorship

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,040
you just have to go and find

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,000
anything that you can as a local

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,959
organizer and there are these uh

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,640
country organizers on top of it that try

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,920
to help all the cities to have the same

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,760
things

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,680
and obviously there is an international

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,519
team that provides

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,280
artwork and all that but it's not

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,760
mandatory to use so

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,840
this is a really relaxed uh structure

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,519
but since i have been organizing that

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,519
for so many years

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:08,879
i usually receive boxes from all the

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,680
distributions and it came

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,319
to my eyes that the most organized box

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,360
that i got

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,480
was from susan and i

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,120
will die to have something like that

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,959
because at that specific conference i

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,040
have to remove my fedora

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,159
t-shirt because i cannot have

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,239
preferences

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:32,560
because i am the international organizer

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,640
so it's not like yeah i use fedora

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,760
everybody knows that i will always cheer

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,599
for fedora but

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,200
i cannot say oh no you cannot use that

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,840
because otherwise investment i mean i

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,879
have to be

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,640
really neutral on that sure sure so they

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,560
gave us uh

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,040
a couple of features it's not a big box

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,000
this is like really tiny box

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,599
it comes uh in the fold so they have

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,480
like a different box every year

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,200
for the releases it comes with three

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,560
t-shirts

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,519
and three different sizes uh it comes

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,040
with

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,280
the gecko the the flushy toy

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,959
comes with a really huge amount of

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,959
stickers from all sizes

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,840
and it comes with a couple of magazines

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,720
and that's it that's everything that it

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,560
has

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,840
sometimes they add uh probably a dvd

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,560
or there was a year that was a

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,440
really huge year for them they gave us a

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,919
tablecloth

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,960
that was like three meters long huge i

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,960
don't know why

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,960
i mean the local community organized

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,400
that but it's default

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,080
it doesn't matter if it's a huge

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,720
conference if it's a small conference

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,919
because it's designed mostly to give

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,199
uh one item to the organizer

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:52,400
and the rest to be uh given away

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,080
either with uh you know a souvenirs or

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,360
put it into a table

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,680
or i don't know making a contest so

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,000
i think that for the following

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,320
conferences that will come

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,360
and hopefully the current buyers help

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,759
with that

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,800
they can have like a really tiny box

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,680
that can be

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,800
uh as i said produce on each continent

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,000
in each group

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,080
uh can i pause it for one second yes

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,199
should we have

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:25,759
do we have notes somewhere

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,759
about this for this session

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,160
all right do you want me to make a

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,680
document

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,400
yeah i can i can just yeah just put it

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,400
build there and i will add all that are

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:43,199
you okay with a google doc

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:46,240
yeah okay um and then my second

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,240
question was

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:54,080
um and this is something that you see as

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,720
a marketing initiative putting the box

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,000
together

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,280
okay yeah because uh since i can handle

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,360
the design

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,280
either just using what we already have

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,560
or doing something new because i know

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,639
that the new logo

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,319
should be coming really soon i have

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,919
still have no idea when that's

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:14,560
coming which is a worry

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,520
but we can do something i can give you

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,720
an update on it

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,840
okay hold on please summarize

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,880
kind of some of the points that we've

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,039
been talking about

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,280
so basically review what we've

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,280
done

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,240
you see what worked and didn't work

00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:50,400
okay um

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,440
to update because with the moving i have

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,479
been like

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,199
one month behind every single schedule

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,560
in my life

00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:01,039
including communities work life

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,160
so you want so you want to put together

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,120
an event

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,360
box so are you thinking that this should

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,639
happen locally or it should happen with

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,759
like

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:15,440
red hat fulfillment and we send it out

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:18,160
yeah okay yeah yeah well

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,880
we can flex it makes it make something

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,599
flexible

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,360
in that case because i know that uh we

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,319
have a lot of reasons to cover

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,720
and shipping can be uh complicated but

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,160
i'm

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,919
sure that i don't know we have a lot of

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,160
marketing team members that are quite

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,280
active and also i think it's

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:42,000
just a matter of time before we

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:44,400
get back to having in-person events and

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,360
when we're able at the point that we're

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,199
able to do that

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,199
i do suspect that shipping will be

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,280
easier yes

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,639
yes so i think i don't know if you

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,160
remember the

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:59,199
10 years t-shirt fedora i think

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,039
you probably saw it so that was a really

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,720
nice gesture

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:08,319
so i have something

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:11,440
um i was mentioning this earlier

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,879
about t-shirts being kind of

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,879
not the best thing to ship

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,720
you can we need t-shirts or are you

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,919
agree with it

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:27,280
i wouldn't put it into the list because

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:30,639
two things even if you make them on bulk

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:33,839
they would not fit right to everyone

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,120
and it's not just about the width but

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,159
also the length

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,560
and also the cuts me as a female

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,640
one things that i have loved during

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,519
these battles that i usually have

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,080
is that i demand to have a female

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,560
version

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,200
t-shirt because they have a better cut

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,839
on the

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,399
waist they have a really better neck

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,120
they have

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,600
uh they're better for our arms just how

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,200
you know

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,800
people we have this so it's

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,800
it's more like something more appealing

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,760
than you just having i mean i don't want

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,920
to feel like a

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,880
walking flag just once you have a

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,279
t-shirt that

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,279
makes me feel good as a female but also

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,160
represents what i like and that that's a

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,399
complication

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,240
oh so right i think that's why t-shirts

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,399
maybe aren't the best

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,000
for where we are right now i'm not

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:24,240
against like

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,720
stickers i will aim hardly to stickers

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,519
and banners big banners because you can

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,920
hang that

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,640
anywhere and if you have something that

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,480
has no

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,600
language related something really

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,880
general with a nice background the logo

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,519
and luck and that

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,880
i mean i have like four of those so not

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,200
everybody has one

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,160
i put on also on i just shared it with

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,839
you

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:52,000
um there are other people oh i'm gmail

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,920
oh and if there are other people

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,240
who want to get in on that document just

00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,399
let me know it's just

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,399
deal with the permissions anyway um

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,880
what are they gonna say oh it's

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,160
because i think it's easy and something

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,680
that is default in

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,000
technically every single country you

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,000
have the 90 by 120 design

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:27,120
and then um a gift for the organizer

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:30,160
a tiny gift yeah yeah i was actually

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,839
just thinking because when you said the

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,640
open souza uh chameleon

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,279
or whatever it is the lizard how cute it

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,600
would be to do a fedora panda

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,959
i have i oh i have a pillow with the

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,600
fedora logo

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:48,160
i have mugs with a floral logo because

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,000
every single turbo

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,399
when it was like a little panda and it

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,560
was wearing like a fedora t-shirt

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,640
i would i would definitely have them and

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,040
i would probably take it on my desk

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,640
and i'm sure that any contributor will

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,279
love that

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,279
right okay

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,920
yeah but it could be like a gift for the

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,079
organizer

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,440
i mean that would be something that is

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,240
unique

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,440
i mean with the years i have become like

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,000
a collector and i

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,600
and i'm sure that i'm not the only one

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,640
collector of the

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,160
federal rallies to give it a name and

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,839
whatnot

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,279
fedora rarity is something that is

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:32,079
pretty strange that nobody

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:35,120
has so i have this poker um

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,640
coins that they did years ago and i

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,680
didn't even play for her

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,279
i have a 3d fedora printed logo that

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,880
spotted

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,480
i mean that was awesome i mean i have

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,000
this this really

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,639
tiny gadgets and logos of the

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,079
different presentations that every

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,959
single time that i open a

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,279
drawer or see my i don't know my closet

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,839
or

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,720
anything it's like you think you're part

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,959
of this

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,639
i can brag about this i can show this

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,519
and see i have it

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,639
because i did something and that's the

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,920
thing that i

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,160
see a lot of i mean i contribute but i

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,839
don't get recognition i don't get

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,600
the attention that i probably was

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,760
expecting from the team

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,839
so maybe something really tiny getting

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:25,839
into their hands

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,839
it can be just yeah

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,200
something really tiny that tells you

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,839
once again hey

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,680
you matter here's something specially

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,040
designed for you

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,440
because again sometimes we try to think

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,760
and i think that has been a mistake

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:46,480
because of the joining rates

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,240
we should go there but not right now we

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,399
should take care of the current

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:56,079
contributors so they feel special again

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,399
and once more they want to bring more

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:01,440
people into the community

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:05,760
so okay i'm gonna pause you

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:08,959
for a second because i go too fast

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,040
i i think your brain is just like

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,800
it's shooting for like the stars you get

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,440
started on something and you get going

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,480
so

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,959
yeah i'm trying to just structure

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,880
this a little bit though i want to

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,760
comment on what you said

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,200
i totally agree with you um i don't know

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,120
if you were in the

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,880
lightning talks but i did a little talk

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,560
about my rise

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,800
idea so my rise idea is

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,399
uh it's an acronym so that you need

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,519
these four things for

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,920
uh an effective or to

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,040
effectively have a healthy community uh

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,440
recognition

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,440
incentives support and empowerment

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,480
so anyway i definitely am behind you on

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,600
the recognition

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,320
and support and that is actually why i

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,360
had

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,839
uh the out richie intern samara the one

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,639
i

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,320
uh mentored do all of those infographics

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,519
which you've probably seen

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,639
yeah so that was a whole

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,600
you know recognition um

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,839
type of a thing and it could actually be

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,839
cool

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:22,560
um sorry give me one second

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,560
okay um it

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,120
probably could be tied into whatever

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,680
marketing strategy we come up with

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,320
because first of all they're newly done

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,399
and

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,600
they they have like entirely the fedora

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,839
look and feel

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,800
and they're going to be in the z and i

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,839
just think it's

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,920
kind of like this we have something to

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,279
base and stuff on

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:48,800
um we want to incorporate but i did

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,360
post the link here to just the marketing

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,880
page

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,399
and i kind of want to look at that and

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:57,360
see like how up-to-date is this

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,800
um you mentioned at the beginning like

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,959
we want to

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,560
talk about what we used to do and what

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,519
our responsibilities

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,160
were in the past i'm just curious that

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:12,079
this page is up to date

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:16,000
no it says it was updated on

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:19,760
april 2020.

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,440
yeah i'm just going to check the edits

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,360
we're done by then because it was just

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,839
expanded something i mean it's spread

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,839
news

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,800
so this is user groups you can't read

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,639
with thora

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:40,480
spawn it's an educate education

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:43,199
i mean it's i mean it should be

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,199
a bit more

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,480
usually too much

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,480
if you don't shoot high you don't have

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,480
time

00:15:52,480 --> 00:16:01,120
okay so the last actual edit

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,120
was under 2017

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:10,880
and it was just um

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,360
they were 5 87 2017 then hold it up

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,639
under 16.

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,680
i really don't number 15 and

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:23,680
that's it so it's technically the same

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,680
page since 2012

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,000
if that answer is your question

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:36,240
oh yeah yeah too much

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:40,240
too much so i don't see i don't think

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:43,120
the magazine i love the podcast

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:46,000
i mean all of that is ways to spread

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,000
each other right

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,519
but i am friends with a challenge right

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,519
now

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,680
i'm looking here though you know about

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,240
the goal of the marketing group

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,399
you know it's from here i'm looking at

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,399
it

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,839
um

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:16,000
you know it's kind of this user faced

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:20,720
goal or objective it's like

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,720
hold on uh aim to support okay

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:33,840
what we do

00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:50,960
from

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:54,240
sorry i'm just reading yeah

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,240
getting caught up in it

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,120
i'll highlight on the creative materials

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,320
of fedora ambassadors well from

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:11,280
fedora contributors for events

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,280
or key points for events or events

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:19,520
my english is basic enough to

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,520
be understood that this is the same

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,160
mentor bring your contributors that's

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,440
joy

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,440
that should not be marketing

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:43,600
i mean i think i think marketing

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,840
and it's not that i want to

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,520
change what marketing does i i just said

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,160
the name marketing because

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,840
i just spread fedora in a more effective

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:57,520
way

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:59,440
uh one of my worries

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,160
is different than what's on the website

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,840
on this website this website says

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:09,120
ensure that fedoran's ambassadors know

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,720
what fedora is uh can consistently

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,720
explain

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,840
why the project can help them and how

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,720
they can help the project

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,720
i do think that's

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:25,840
a valid uh goal

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,840
but i think that

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:35,200
i don't know i'm like i guess i'm like

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:38,400
for me i'm thinking about like

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,720
are we focusing on users

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,760
are we focusing on like are we focused

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,400
on

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,120
users are we focused on enriching the

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,320
experience for our current contributors

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:53,679
are we focused on like

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,840
outreach like i think that the way that

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,240
you go about marketing something is kind

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,320
of

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:04,320
could be different for different goals

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:07,760
so i guess this to me kind of seems like

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:10,559
slightly limiting or

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,320
just i think if it's this precise like

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,960
we should reevaluate like

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,360
is this the goal that we can want to

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,440
continue to have

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,880
um you know you're talking about

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,480
something like that

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:28,000
that error should answer better than me

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,000
when he's missing an action

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,720
i think he's missing an action all day

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,240
today he was supposed to give away when

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,640
talk

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,600
uh oh yeah i was at the beginning of the

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,799
lightning talks

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:43,120
but then i had to go and run and cook

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,559
i mean i just don't it's not like i want

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,520
to revamp

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,440
the marketing team i just said the name

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,480
because marketing at the end is

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,559
spreading things right so so okay

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,000
this is an idea i guess i'll just talk

00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,559
about this since

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,520
we're at that level that base level of

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:03,600
things

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:06,799
um something i had thought about was

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,000
um so i think you and i had this

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,679
discussion we were like

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,240
oh websites team is a failure or

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,880
you know cromwaps isn't functioning

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,600
anymore

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,440
or you know we're seeing all these teams

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,919
as failures

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:26,880
instead of an evolution or hey we did

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,720
you know we took a misstep somewhere but

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,400
we don't necessarily need to consider

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,679
this a failure we need to look at a

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,520
place to grow

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,799
so part of uh one of the first things i

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,840
was actually looking at

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,440
but life coveted i don't know

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,000
happened and

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,080
i feel like some of the ideas and

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,960
projects i had

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,679
like coming up january into february

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,320
kind of just

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:57,200
died so something that i was working on

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,720
was an org chart or like something of a

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,640
reorg

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,880
and one thing that i talked about was

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,120
including the marketing marketing theme

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,919
in with the design

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,600
now currently the design team is not

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,520
meeting

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,120
they are semi i would say they're

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,880
semi-active

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,919
are decently active on their pejora repo

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,559
so they're doing work um but they're not

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:27,520
meeting

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:30,559
which is fine i think um and

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,360
and yeah i talked to him about it

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,120
um for anybody who's watching this

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,360
that's the design team leader

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,480
um and i talked to her about it and she

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,320
was like yeah whatever

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,000
you need to do or whatever you think is

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,520
best like we're willing to work with

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,320
that and like

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,520
i think um doing a little bit of

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,080
condensing

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,440
with some of the teams it's a good idea

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,960
so my idea was to

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,200
just kind of bring marketing

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,360
and design together now the other thing

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,200
we have to think about i think is like

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,240
there's separate repos they're separate

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:08,240
channels they're separate

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,610
all of this stuff for both of them

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,720
so that does create

00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:15,760
[Music]

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,360
something of an issue um

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,960
in the idea of like bringing them

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,840
together because you have two

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:25,280
channels for communications but i don't

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,280
know it's something we could think about

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,720
a little bit more i actually have

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,919
someone

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,320
in mind for

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,720
the marketing team were you able to

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:40,240
watch the keynotes this morning

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,240
no i was still asleep

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,880
that's okay you're lucky my kid was a

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,880
mess

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:52,720
um well

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:56,000
there's a sarah finn

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,520
she's a she's on cbe and red hat

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,440
and she actually has a background in

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,120
marketing and i was you know she was

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,760
like how could i get involved in fedora

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,919
i don't know

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,520
and i'm like this would be a great place

00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,000
so i have i'm like

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,120
trying to do some recruitment and it

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
would like start

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,640
talking it up a little bit you know how

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,760
i've been doing for the ambassadors

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:20,640
yeah and you know

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,910
starting to kind of get on its way so i

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,360
do envision

00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:26,320
[Music]

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,880
like a full revamp for marketing and

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,240
design

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,440
to kind of merge so how do you see that

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:36,720
like like marketing making requests

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,200
and design responding um

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,320
within the team not having tickets for

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,600
the time but

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,320
marketing tickets i think um i think

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,520
having

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,760
marketing like so if marketing has like

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:53,600
a vision of like what we're trying to

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:56,720
to kind of do right um

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,480
i think some design tasks will have

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,559
nothing to do with

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,080
like marketing has nothing to do with

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,080
and i think other things we would

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,679
collaborate very closely on

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,360
and i think we could collaborate in a

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,080
variety of ways

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:13,120
but like for example say if the

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:16,159
marketing team came up with a campaign

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,000
um like the we are fedora campaign

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,400
and we came up with all the different

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,960
ideas of the things we wanted to do

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,760
and then we can bring that you know to

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,679
the design

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,840
first of all i think we should include

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,760
them in the idea ideation part because

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,520
they're really creative people

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,039
so that's a chance for us to all sit

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,400
down and say what what

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,200
can we do here's the i here's the core

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,840
of the

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,880
campaign um like say we are fedora

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,919
campaign and then we all sit down and

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,760
say well like

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,840
i have the skills to edit together a

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,720
video and i have

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,760
um skills to organize the whole thing

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,520
overall and i have the skills to make

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,720
you know etc etc so that's kind of my

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,320
thought and how

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,799
design and marketing work together

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,600
um you know kind of like a creative

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,720
agency

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,600
would yeah exactly that's what that's

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,919
what i would like

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,600
because at the end we're trying to

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,279
promote a product

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,640
it's a free product but it's a student

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,200
product

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,400
right right and that's that's what i

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,679
don't see us

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,159
going right now right so so i guess my

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,279
question

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,799
is is the marketing team slash design

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:33,679
team's goal

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:33,679
is our focus on like

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:41,520
is it um letting new users

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,200
is it on getting new contributors is it

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:47,279
showing off

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,200
what we're currently about is it about

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,640
you know making our current contributors

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,840
feel good so i think there's all these

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,039
different

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:58,320
campaigns that can be run

00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:01,679
underneath this yeah um

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,039
and actually i have a really cool

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,960
thought

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:09,360
which is way i knew we should merge

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,400
this this specific workshop because i

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,559
think that

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,039
yeah uh my thought is i think we should

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:19,200
have a marketing intern

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:19,200
for the winter outreachy session

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,679
it would not be for me it would be to do

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:38,960
this project

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:41,679
no no oh okay like it would be like a

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,399
we we would have i mean i would probably

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,440
mentor

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:47,440
or co-mentor like with you or something

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,399
like that or like eduard like the three

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,240
of us could

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,520
could do it together i think it would be

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,559
a really joint

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:58,399
because i have the design part

00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:01,039
and the crazy creative one but

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,000
i mean you have the more white

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,960
perspective

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,559
and ever has the more in-depth marketing

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,799
perspective so

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,679
this is someone who has to be influenced

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,320
by

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,039
several teams to do an effective job and

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,200
something that

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,600
even if we want each one of us

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,600
individually could not

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,600
what is it isn't a strategy

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,840
so i think what we would want them to do

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:30,640
is focus on

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:33,840
writing kelly campaign strategies

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:37,360
if they do if they like say we had

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:39,919
five different ideas we chose or four

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,520
whatever four different ideas we chose

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,440
with some solid like

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,320
this is why this is the background

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,320
history and then they write up like

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,320
this is you know how much you're going

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,880
to tweet and this is how many

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,720
blog posts and whatever the whole

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,799
strategy for the entire thing that's

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,840
what i would like to see

00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,840
none of us have to do

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,679
you know and so we can just once we have

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,159
that

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,960
campaign strategy or you know whatever

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,320
outline

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,320
that we can implement it

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:16,480
so i'm just adding on the of the notes

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,919
but it's having to have an intro to work

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,919
with both things

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,760
and creating making things so probably

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,640
the main kind of things to start with

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,520
will be

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,720
one to showcase what is currently being

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,480
done

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,360
but probably more personally but that's

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,610
something that can be developed

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,720
what is currently

00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:40,240
[Music]

00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:43,440
second probably will be a small

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,240
recognition package for organizing

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,520
conferences

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,520
or talks or that

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,880
um small thank you i'm just gonna be in

00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,760
one of them

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,960
why should i write because i have a

00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,760
secretary of duty

00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,760
for me anyway

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,600
i need to here we go i was trying to go

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,679
so we could both type things

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,600
yeah but do you think that they go in

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:13,360
the same because one thing is

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:16,000
uh you are doing this amazing job

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,799
uh building these or support maintaining

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,880
this

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,840
for the distribution and then the other

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,880
will be

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,600
more into the joining ambassador mentors

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,240
side or you have been doing an amazing

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,840
job

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,880
by bringing people to country groups

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:35,039
so it will be too separated probably

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,200
experience one is about technical

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,760
accomplishment and the other is about

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,760
human economy

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,279
that's something that i don't know if

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,480
you were the one who said that

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,679
earlier today or yesterday that one

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,279
thing was

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:56,960
the technical side and the other was the

00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:58,080
human side i mean when we talk about

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,120
contributors

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,200
it usually divides in two sections so it

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,039
should tackle those issues

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:10,080
and this person should help us in to

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:13,360
coordinate how are going to be this

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,880
during pandemic uh small

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:20,000
medium and big events and why we

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,919
as a group as fedora can do to help

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,679
to make them really look really

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,760
professional because that's

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,720
probably one of the things that attract

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,799
the most users

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,440
but the world doesn't seem like uh you

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,519
know a group of crazy people who

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,279
you know don't have a life it looks like

00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,559
a group of professionals who build

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,120
something

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:41,200
at least that's why i joined most of the

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,159
people that i have bring with me

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,200
right that's what they see so we need to

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,360
try to keep that

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,039
professionally one of the things that i

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,080
love was how this

00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:55,279
nest conference was built and i believe

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,080
i have gone into a really huge amount of

00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:00,159
conference

00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,440
during this uh five months online and

00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:05,120
this was like

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,960
i mean rockets it was just

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,320
amazing the coordination the

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,559
availability

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,159
uh how you can just join anything and

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,919
you can participate

00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,279
and you can have your face there and

00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,559
everybody can chat and

00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:21,600
basically are strange thing from

00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:23,760
yeah it made my laptop die but i was

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,760
happy

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,960
but that things should come with a

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,080
strategy

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,039
for those who are not used to this kind

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,640
of conference

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:37,039
because we are a minority we like it or

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,799
not

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,559
the people who have been going to

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:43,760
conferences for years

00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,640
either small medium or large it's not

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,760
the

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,519
the rule so how can we help those who

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,760
are not used to that

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,840
to have a really professional looking

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:57,039
conference and that actually comes with

00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,919
results

00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:02,159
so that's that's my main goal there

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:05,360
because i really like conferences

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:08,720
i mean i i have tried to to

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,760
provide as much design and

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,440
you know ideas and and really tiny

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,480
things to make everything look

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:20,799
really neat but this pandemic

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:24,240
era is isn't brand new for anyone

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:25,600
so if we could also wrap that up and how

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,600
to tell

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,120
that can you give like a brief summary

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,880
of that one

00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:37,360
yeah uh create a new strategy

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:39,440
for this colbit era conferences

00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,120
and we can divide it into small and

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,200
medium because the large ones

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,720
are going to be organized by you know

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,559
the full staff

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,399
but the small and the medium ones are

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,919
the ones that need help

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:54,000
we are having once a month uh wordpress

00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:57,360
uh conferences

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,880
really small of the friends that living

00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,559
in my city and some that

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,480
moving to the place that i'm living now

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:05,919
because it's really close

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,159
and i'm having like from 30 to 45 people

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,079
connected use a meetup

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,440
it's a it's a website that you pick a

00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,639
subscription

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:18,079
so mozilla pays a subscription for that

00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,919
it's like 30 bucks or something and they

00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,760
keep connected through that and it's

00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:22,480
really cute because you have recordings

00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,879
and

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,599
and you can set the pictures if you took

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,679
a picture

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,320
and it gives you notifications through

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:34,000
email so it kind of keeps you

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,679
on the loop and a week before the

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,240
conference it says hey you know wait

00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,520
you're gonna

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,280
it has some reminders post reminders

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,040
hey this is how you look or this was

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,480
your screenshot during the conference

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,760
how are you what's good what

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:51,040
was it good so also has some pools which

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,359
i can actually i mean i can do uh hop in

00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:56,800
has some of this functionality

00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:58,960
except um i didn't

00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,760
have access to the platform very early

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,960
so yeah

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,960
[Music]

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,680
next time and we can start learning more

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:09,040
about it and figuring out how to use

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,680
more of its functionality um the tools

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,160
are there

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,359
but we need someone to help us but i

00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,720
think

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:17,280
my question is like for me it's less

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,599
about

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,119
like that's my job right to figure out

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,079
how the different

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,200
features work and to inform everybody

00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,079
about that

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,200
for me it's more like well i think we

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,160
would like to get

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,079
more people at the conference i think

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,440
that would be like a great goal for the

00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,839
marketing team to try

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,760
like what kind of campaign strategy can

00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:42,400
we use where can we go

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,960
to get more of the right people here

00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,880
yeah

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,079
so for me when i think about the design

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,800
part

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,880
specifically how to make more appeal in

00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,839
the conference how to have the right

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,560
content

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:56,160
how to help them have a really neat

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,520
presentation

00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,240
uh how to make an effective uh spreading

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,240
campaign

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,359
before the conference and how to make an

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,400
effective

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,670
post contact uh post-event contact

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,760
campaign for them to keep in touch

00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:12,480
[Music]

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,440
but that's helping the either their

00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,960
people from drawing

00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:20,560
or ambassadors so they can stay in touch

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:23,839
that then you come with the mentors uh

00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:25,420
[Music]

00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:38,160
because i just cook for the first time

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,880
chicken uh

00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:44,160
biscuits like heart kidneys and all that

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:47,520
i couldn't seem to uplift and i was like

00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,520
i don't know this is not gonna be good

00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,800
i'm about to have some ramen and i'm

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,440
pretty excited about that

00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,880
it's delivering actually maybe very soon

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,040
yes ramen is delicious

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,280
that's okay how long have we been here i

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,359
don't see the time span

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,280
uh we've been here about 40 minutes yeah

00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,520
it's okay this was actually the time

00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,950
that i had in mind like an hour

00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,119
i think you said hour and a half

00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:16,000
[Music]

00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,280
right i mean i i'm just so i think that

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,400
there's a lot more to

00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,320
discuss i feel like yeah

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,920
i'm a little concerned about you know

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,720
just being me and you here right now

00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,079
like i feel like we need more input and

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,880
i almost feel like

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,800
this could be this marketing thing could

00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,560
be something that we

00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,720
talk about at a mindshare committee

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,720
meeting

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,320
i think we'd have like a lot of good

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,320
input there and

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,599
like we could even open a ticket on the

00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,720
mindshare committee

00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,240
repo saying you know basically like

00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,320
requests for a revamp

00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,400
if we're giving these out these days

00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,079
let's do one over here

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,320
what i think that i'm going to do after

00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:59,599
the meeting ends

00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,440
i will try to annoy edward to answer me

00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,800
it doesn't matter if it's tomorrow

00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,040
probably he's just taking the day off

00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,359
with the family

00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,880
and once i get his input from the

00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:11,520
marketing side

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,880
then i will open the ticket because i

00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,040
think that

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,960
yeah as you said it's just not changing

00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,640
how things work it's just like

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,119
it's just bringing people to work

00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,680
together more efficiently

00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,320
so if we don't present this as a change

00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,800
but as

00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:32,079
a collaborative uh work

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,440
something that is temporal to see how it

00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,480
works

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,000
then if everything works as we want to

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,320
then we can make some changes so it's

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,200
smoothly so we don't have all the drama

00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,200
that we have with them

00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,200
okay well i might just write in the

00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:51,359
session chat

00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:54,960
that we finished up our meeting

00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,960
and to look forward to the recording

00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,119
