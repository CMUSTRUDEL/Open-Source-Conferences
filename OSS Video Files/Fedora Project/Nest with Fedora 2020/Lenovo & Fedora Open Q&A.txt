as for my face i can try to do something

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,680
about that but i did not have a chance

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,200
to test my video

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,799
so you might be looking at my nostrils

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,040
for a couple seconds i'll let

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,040
that

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,399
while you show everybody your nostrils

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,799
passo um i'm mark's counterpart on the

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,640
commercial marketing side

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,320
i work i'm basically the software

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,520
product manager for all of our lenovo

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,640
workstations

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,600
so i'm i i work with him and i take all

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,280
of the

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,520
business cases up and discuss them with

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,840
management and get approval and push

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,479
for the overall linux strategy across

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,080
lenovo

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:15,200
yeah so and john frequently uh

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,360
saves my bacon and um helps me out

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,360
so

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,879
already so um i said i'd really like

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,000
this

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,840
this con this to be more of a

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,560
conversation q a i definitely want to

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,480
hear from

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,319
from you guys i was a little bit nervous

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,160
about having 50 minutes of just open

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,360
questions so i've put together some

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,640
topics to cover um we'll cover here so

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,040
i tried to guess what would be

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,879
interestingly useful um if something is

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,720
completely useless and let me know but

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,280
i'm hoping some of it is of interest

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,040
everybody

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,120
uh we will talk about the web sales

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,720
update and we will talk about the fedora

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,519
portal and then

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,080
uh i've got just a slide describing some

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,519
of what

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,519
i learned for sure and some of the

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,280
process that went into doing releasing a

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,920
linux platform um for the first time

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,040
it's been an interesting exercise uh and

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,560
then i've just got a bunch of stuff

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,159
about other things that lenovo doing

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,480
more linux related not

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,200
specifically fedora but more linux just

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,040
kind of

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,640
let you guys know what else we're up to

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,480
and then yeah i i was planning on

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,959
leaving a big questions feedback

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,879
i'll i think i'll take questions as they

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,239
come along i've got the chat up here

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,000
it's kind of annoying the screen's there

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,640
the camera's there so my apologies

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,360
um but i'll try and take questions as we

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,120
go along

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,239
and keep it as interactive as possible

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,239
and there's mr john

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,959
already so i'm assuming one of the big

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,480
things everyone wants to know is about

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,280
the web sales update where are those

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,400
platforms

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,440
so let's get into it so the x1 carbon 8

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,280
has cleared

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,280
all but the last paperwork hurdle it's

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,319
basically it's with the web sales team

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,680
uh to enable it and get it up on the web

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,080
and we got confirmation it will be

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,840
before august 31st so i can't give you

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,280
it will be this date but they promised

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,319
they will have it done before august

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,959
31st

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,840
hopefully soon about worst case set

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,400
august 31st is as your date

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,760
so uh i've been pushing hard for this

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,040
one

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,159
so we have the p1 gen2 and the p53 as

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,120
well

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,480
um no this is not secret stuff luna

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,079
you're the first people to

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,519
well no matthew's the first person to

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,440
know um

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,639
i told him before this and and then but

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,240
uh but no this is not

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,680
uh secret um we'll try and get you a

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,759
more fixed date i mean

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,199
after that um we i don't think we

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,680
haven't done any media announcement

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,759
either

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,520
honestly this stuff is fairly hot off

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,960
the press um

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,520

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,400
to get us a formal announcement

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,919
through pr this week so um

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,400
it's not a problem if you guys socialize

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,400
it a bit but don't expect a big lenovo

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,440
state pin until

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,479

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,639
just this morning because i was hoping

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,360
to put the date in there um

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,080
coming soon so john do you want to

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,840

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,840
with targeting end of august as well

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,199
schedule so before the end of august um

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,560
same thing it'll be

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,080
the wheat this and now the announcement

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,639
that i'm going to try to get for this

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,160
week

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:39,440
we'll cover these as well so but it's

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,720
same ballpark and coming soon

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,080
and just the the final teaser

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,960
um so we did get approved to do fedora

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,639
on the p1 gen 3 and the p15 so success

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,960
is the p1 gen2 p53

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,680
so they will be coming along later this

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,039
year

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,759
we've started testing on those and

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,280
you know the process that so it's it's

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,440
not just those three now we got

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:08,160
permission to go ahead and do that

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,199
right so uh michelle for your question

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,319
worldwide

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:15,440
yes it will be worldwide the only

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,080
issue i know of is russia there is some

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,600
legal issues with russia software which

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,680
means that

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,199
we can't confirm russia yet but

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,800
otherwise plan is worldwide did you want

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,960
to add anything there john

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,919
yes so there um while they will be

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,120
worldwide

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,199
the web sales enablement is done

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,400
each country has or each geo has

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,520
different websites

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,240
so they tend to lag a little bit um so

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,400
in the meantime once they're live for

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,560
sale here in the us

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,479
anybody it can go to their their local

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,319
store and use the call-in number

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,919
to reach inbound sales who will be able

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,440
to configure a system for you

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,360
you might just not be able to do it on

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:58,400
the web for a little bit until they

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,400
catch up thanks john

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,599
already could you

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,479
uh yes oh well i mean you you can

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,960
install the oh

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,319
can we do it no we can't ship you we

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,080
can't install uh

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,520
so so the question is could you install

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,440
the fedora image to those who selected

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,400
the ubuntu one so obviously we have uh

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,880
full configuration for ubuntu uh we

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,560
can't

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,000
we can't install fedora and

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,319
manufacturing that

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,759
that that just wouldn't work but you can

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,039
buy the ubuntu one and put food on it

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,199
there's nothing stopping you

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,720
uh i've put fedora on a lot of our

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,160
platforms

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,160
it works fine so yes

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,199
we ta for catching up it's really it's a

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,280
prioritization question for the

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,319
individual geo web teams so a lot

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,000
depends on what

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,840
what promotions they've got going on

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,840
what other work they've got going on

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,639
um it could be it could be any um

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,240
anything from a week to day some of them

00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,440
might simply decide not to put it up on

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,120
the web

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,120
the each geo has their own decision for

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,919
that

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,160
but again i do have it enabled in the

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,680
internal configurators so inbound sales

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,759
will always be able to configure this

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:17,280
for you and sell it to you

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:20,240
okay and um each refresh needs to be

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,280
manually approved so we're still working

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,560
through that it'll be interesting when

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,280
fedora 33

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,000
comes out we do have a test cycle that

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,840
it has to go

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,479
through um so it's not gonna happen

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,440
automatically there's costs and time and

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,640
all the rest of it so

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,800
we're not picking up i mean fedora

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,159
changes so often it's not like

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,399
you get a new image every day um so

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,519
we're still gauging that one um might be

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,279
something that should come back to you

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,160
guys for recommendations but

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,600
um uh yeah i don't have a great answer

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,920
for you there but yes i'm i'm

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,600
kind of hoping we do updates at least

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,080
for the big releases

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,959
um it's gonna depend honestly a little

00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,519
bit on

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,440
resources and what's available um oh but

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,399
oh you mean a hardware refresh

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,360
uh well p103 yeah we we don't know for

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,640
the rest it's a little bit do you want

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,200
to cover this one john

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,160
yeah so so um generally what i do on the

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,040
workstation side

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,560
is i i go ahead and get it i've already

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,959
got it in the

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,760
mrd documents the marketing requirement

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,480
stocks

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,600
for those successor products so that

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,240
line will continue to offer them

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,839
whether any expansions to that like for

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,480
instance if we if we branch off and we

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,800
want to add it on the p53s for instance

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,920
that becomes a a separate discussion and

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,839
approval because then we have to get

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,839
back into the business case

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,279
okay um i'm going to be a little bit

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,560
careful because this question is going

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,320
out first so julian

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,760
i'm going to actually come back to your

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,720
question when i do the timeline for

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,959
product because it will

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,399
give you an idea of what's involved with

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,880
releasing a new image

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,440
um and so i'll cover that then i i've

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:59,519
already touched on it but just for that

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:04,079
uh oh um lvfs i assume

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:07,600
uh so uh i'm sorry martin my

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:11,680
official lift roadmap for lvfs support

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:15,200
um the way it works is we are pushing

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,920
very hard that lvfs support is for

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,720
all platforms all firmware devices on

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,480
the platform

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,079
so bios and uh the system firmware you

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,040
will get it for all our linux supported

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,240
platforms

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,079
um for the devices we need support from

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,560
the manufacturers and they get

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,519
strongly pushed for it it's it should

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,560
happen

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,800
um it is happening sorry excuse me

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,880
but sometimes it's slower than others so

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,160
i it's not it's not 100 yet

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,640
but we're really working on it the

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,480
number of devices is going down i know

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,120
since i joined the team last year

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,839
uh it's that the gap is getting smaller

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,680
but we are

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,920
looking at that and working on it did

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,160
you want to add anything on lvfs john

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,680
no i think that covers it okay um i did

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,720
want to note though that you did miss a

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,720
question from michelle

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,240
or just workstation uh it's just

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,320
workstation uh right now i

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,079
actually played the silver blue um a

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,440
month or so back um there was a fedora

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,279
magazine article hey push

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,519
shout out for ben i love fedora magazine

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,040
it's brilliant um and it had an article

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,839
about silver blue and i went and tried

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,680
it it works

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,959
it works nicely so i i ran it on the x1

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,079
carbon beautiful

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,360
um so yeah right now i honestly

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,519
we don't have the bandwidth to do

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,360
multiple multiple versions

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,680
um so not yet workstation for now

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,399
we'll take if if yours if silverblue

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,880
takes

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,720
over workstation then i guess we would

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,800
switch maybe two but that's a discussion

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,120
for the future

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,120
um

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,720
uh the function and control keys that

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,160
are swappable

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,920
is there a way to fit this i don't know

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,639
the answer to that one or will we need

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,240
bios

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,760
i think uh you might have to send me an

00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,240
email on that one and i'd have to go dig

00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,920
into it

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,760
so my email address is right at the end

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,279
of the presentation but mark pierce and

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,120
that went over

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,399
i i want to say that it requires the

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,959
bios and

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,320
that but um that we can use lmi

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,720
potentially to do that

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,680
yes and we will mention lmi later it's a

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,680
good question

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,839
okay so i can't ryan i can't give you a

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,920
good answer now but i will

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:24,240
uh um

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,680
super interested in the so for those who

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,880
are interested there was a poll that we

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,680
created yesterday

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,040
uh um about whether you'd rather have an

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,839
intel or an amd platform which was

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,160
interesting so

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,440
i genuinely am interested in finding out

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,399
which platforms

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,120
people want um quite often it's a case

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,160
of

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,680
there's a range um

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,800
john and i were discussing it just just

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,519
what's the best way to collect that

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,959
information

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,320
so for now send me the details

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,000
maybe as an email i'll collect them

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,839
together uh it

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,839
is i'd like to find a way of doing that

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,320
because uh thanks matthew

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,000
uh it does drive we wanna we wanna

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,279
provide what what you guys want right

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,720
there's no point of spending a lot of

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,680
time and effort putting on platforms

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,920
that aren't useful

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,240
to the community and and linux

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,639
developers um but yeah everybody does

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,839
want

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,959
something different so anyway i think

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,800
we've got some answers in there john um

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,920
well actually i was going to suggest it

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,760
would probably be a good thing if we

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,560
want to start a forum thread to solicit

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,480
this feedback

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,480
that's that's an interesting idea i'll

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,920
mention that yeah that way

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,240
everybody's comments will be visible to

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,320
the rest of the community and we'll get

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,920
get more discussion yeah and and just

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,519
that neil i i've heard a few comments

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,240
about nvidia's that's uh it's not just

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:38,560
for dollar um

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,720
that's bye-bye did i miss anything else

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,639
any chance of any lenovo two-in-one

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,120
laptops ah that that's

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,560
so two-in-one is i have to be careful

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,519
cause i i keep getting stuck on internal

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,000
curtain names but

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,639
there's the detachable is that what

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,959
we're talking about

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,279
so that doesn't have linux enablement on

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,399
it partly a lot of this is driven by the

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,120
product teams

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,800
not wanting it uh of the foldable one

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,720
yeah now i played the

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,839
foldable one when i was uh down in uh

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,199
mowersville north

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,680
carolina um last um actually

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,279
yeah it's interesting technology uh we

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,680
don't have linux enablement on that now

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,639
so

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,480
i can't comment um we yeah that doesn't

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,199
have linux on it full start right now i

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,279
think

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,279
partly because it's too new um it'll be

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,519
interesting to see what's needed to make

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,279
it work from a linux point of view

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,560
i'm assuming there'll be changes needed

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,079
in gnome

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,600
or whatever um so the yogas are covered

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,320
yeah we have linux enablement on the

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,360
yogas

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,399
so okay you actually uh you uh so i'm

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,760
kind of neil i have to

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,959
i'll have to talk to you uh at some

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,519
point if you've got it running on the

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,760
fold because

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,079
i would i asked for one so i could play

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:49,440
with it and i i haven't got one so

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,440
um so there you go

00:14:51,360 --> 00:15:00,480
okay how the p53 is validated

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,880
oh no we are we uh so

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,639
it depends on this obviously for fedora

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,600
we validated it with nouveau

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,959
um and when i come to the charts later

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,600
we'll be part of the testing but yeah no

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,720
we we do

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,440
and nouveau and um the

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,199
test team did test the nvidia install on

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,360
fedora but it wasn't priority

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,560
it does the nvidia driver gets tested

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,839
through the other distros

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:27,440
so it gets covered as well um

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,680
so um

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,920
yes and the external monitor requires

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:37,040
the nvidia card sets from gpu yes

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:39,519
so but it we do test with nuvo

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,480
and intel only and you know both hybrid

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,480
and discrete mode

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,600
already so i'm going to move on and

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,959
there's a big section at the end if you

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,279
think of any other questions that come

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:54,079
up

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:55,920
so um next one is the

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,440
fedora portal that we've got linux

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,519
portal so um

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:04,560
the idea here is we wanted a way to um

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,199
to to make it easier for linux

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,880
developers

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,399
to get hold of these platforms we wanted

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,959
to we want to work with the community

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,600
and

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,880
john this was your idea right um so john

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,959
ran with this one

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,160
but we yeah there will be a portal and

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,759
you'll be able to uh

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,320
go in and log in with your

00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:22,800
fedoraproject.org

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,639
email id so recommend making sure your

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,240
fedora project email address works i

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,199
know mine doesn't right now so i've got

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,680
to get that fixed

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,639
um but you'll be able to register you

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,360
can create an account

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,880
using that and you basically you get an

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,480
extra discount so

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,240
the screenshot there is from the

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,639
employee one because i couldn't get into

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,880
the

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:45,600
uh the linux one but um

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,160
yeah basically it it is as easy as that

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,000
um

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,399
we will announce the url it will be in

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,680
the august time frame as well with

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,040
everything else

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,040
um so

00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,000
hopefully hopefully it's good uh and

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,240
just

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,759
it's for everything lenovo it's not just

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,360
the linux ones you should be able to get

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:09,360
anything so if you do want that

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:11,039
t14 amd and we don't have it

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,039
actually we do have linux on that one

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,000
but if you defoldable there you go if

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,360
you want to go buy the foldable you'll

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,839
be able to buy it with a discount and

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,600
early on

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,520
so already um

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,760
actually and so julian i've already got

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,319
enough criteria to get the email address

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,679
it's just

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,959
some reason it's bouncing right now it's

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,839
more technical issue rather than that

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,000
it's uh

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,960
ben ben was helping me out yesterday one

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,320
but we didn't quite

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,240
get there otherwise i would have had a

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,360
screenshot of the real thing

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,160
so anyway um as for the quantity of the

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,640
discount that

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,760
that varies and it's it's all handled by

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,480
a different team on the

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,799
on the back end so it will actually

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,240
periodically change like if we've got a

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,000
a lot of inventory or something then

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,960
it'll go it'll increase if we're trying

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,640
to get rid of something

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,320
the discount on a specific product will

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,760
increase so there

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,520
there's a lot of moving pieces there so

00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,960
it's not a fixed number

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:04,480
um but it is um i've been told it is

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,480
comparable to what we get as employees

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,039
right and just so you know it's the same

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,960
for the employee one as well i i

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,640
i have spent my own money on lenovo

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,480
equipment using the employee discount

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,160
and it's sometimes it's worth monitoring

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,080
what's happening and and

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,440
yeah i i don't know how they decide to

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,320
place on that

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,640
and christian in terms of your answer um

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,679
that is actually a possibility you can

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,520
buy the systems with no os um however to

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,160
do so you actually do have to call that

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,840
number

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,000
to spot to talk to the inbound sales

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,480
team and they can configure it that way

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,919
now to note there are some countries

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,360
where that's not permitted

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,360
where there are regulations saying that

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,760
it has to ship with an operating system

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,200
and if so it will just default to

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,160
installing something like freedos or

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,160
something on there for you

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,039
already and um

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,360
one more thing um in terms of the

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,760
question i forget who it came from

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,799
around um potential fake contributors

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,640
trying to get access

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,799
uh so so we're not announcing this

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,360
widely publicly um basically

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,000
we're leaving it to to mark and and the

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,160
other

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,559
folks on the fedora leadership team to

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,360
communicate it across the entire

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,720
organization of contributors but if we

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,240
start seeing a big problem where you

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,440
guys are seeing a lot of people

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,280
registering who aren't actually

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,720
contributing then

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,440
we can discuss with you in terms of how

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,120
we can try to line that up

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,280
but we found that we thought that doing

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,240
it via the fedoraproject.org was much

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,960
simpler

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,720
than asking for a list of emails that we

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,400
had to continually update and

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,120
there's privacy concerns and whatnot

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,039
that are all much more difficult

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,880
yeah so we're hoping the

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,280
fedorproject.org is a nice easy way of

00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,400
just

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,120
making it available to your whole

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,840
community without extra paperwork but if

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,679
it doesn't work

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:10,720
let us know we can change it so um

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:13,120
okay uh and yeah matthew hey

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,720
you know where to hit me if there's

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,720
issues

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,600
it's uh yeah the aim is to help fedora

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
we definitely don't want to make your

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,840
lives worse

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,320
that would be bad already so

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,679
they were the they were the big ones for

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,200
so um

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,720
after this i'm going to get more into

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,679
just stuff that i thought would be

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,799
interesting

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:36,000
um and keep an eye on

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,039
questions so i thought doing anything

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,159
for the first time i actually thought

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,159
it'd be an interesting point

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,440
first time is it exciting interesting or

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,559
just pure hell um

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,080
i learned a lot doing this um but so

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,000
doing a links platform on the web has

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,720
been something that has actually been

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,640
worked on for a very long time there's a

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,600
lot of different pieces that have to go

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,320
together so

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,440
um but from fedor point of view let's

00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,760
give you guys so uh

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,480
we kicked off the project in uh february

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,360
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,880
uh matthew and i both traveled down to

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,159
morrisville and met up with a whole

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,280
bunch of different people

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:12,480
and uh different teams in lenovo um

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,799
nathan curry that kind of stuff and

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,159
basically i think everybody signed off

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,039
that's uh

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,840
that's my recollection anyway um and

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,159
then

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,159
after that steady standard what you'd

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,200
expect we had the uh initial testing so

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,440
we took the uh

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,520
initial fedora 32 image and we put on

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,600
platforms and it went to testing

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,200
um bug fixing alpha image better image

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,640
that kind of side of things the only

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,360
thing that was interesting there is

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,400
it was still stealth um and so i know

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,600
the bugs were

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,440
private bugs um and it was all kind of

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,039
and doing something in an open community

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,880
like fedora but stealth

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,240
so again back to that very first live

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,039
thank you because i know it was a bit

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,600
weird

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,880
uh but appreciate your help on that one

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,440
um

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,799
so and going forward i expect us to be

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,280
doing things much more

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,640
publicly uh don't don't expect the

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:07,039
fedora stuff to be stealth

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:09,679
anymore um so april 24th we had the

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,360
fedora 32 announcement and again that

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,880
from my point of view that was fun i'd

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,679
never been involved with something like

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,720
that the

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:20,000
reaction media community everything

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,280
was genuinely amazing it was and

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,280
just so you guys know that makes a

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,440
difference in lenovo because

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,799
relatively small team but it gets

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,799
executives aware

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,159
of how important the learners community

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,520
is and that's good and just you know i'm

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,760
struggling to read the comments to go up

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,799
so john i'll leave you to monitor those

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,720
um so then

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,240
we after the announcement so may to do

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,360
and we created our final

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,880
ga image based off the the fedora 32

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,559
release and it going through the final

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,200
testing part we had a few last

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,320
minute issues there wasn't anything

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,039
major but we had a

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,559
few things that uh are not necessarily

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,880
fixed in that particular image but uh

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,720
now

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,900
upstream and then back down into effect

00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,919
too

00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,840
[Music]

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,600
something else that came up and it ties

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,000
in a little bit to the worldwide release

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,840
so

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,520
we have to do energy certification uh

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,039
labels so

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,799
any certification there's actually

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,240
there's seven different certifications

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,520
it has to go through

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,159
and for the workstations with a

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,320
different graphics card every flavor

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,520
uh actually it's i'd say the panel i

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,039
think it's matter but anyway

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,039
it's quite a lot of quite a lot of

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,240
process there so this is all

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,600
stuff that's happening in the background

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,159
that you don't even think about but we

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,080
need that

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,400
energy certification or we can't sell on

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,720
the web uh so that was happening

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,440
there were some there was um you know a

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,120
few few

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,720
hiccups along the way there that needed

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,760
to be learned about

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,080
understood so

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,440
that something else that came up that

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,640
was

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,559
probably should have been expected

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,840
somewhat but we had to improve our

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,240
product documentation

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,480
it was obviously strongly windows based

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,440
um so we now have linux documentation

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,240
for our products

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,640
uh which which i think is is important

00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,840
um

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,400
it's not perfect but it's it's um it's

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,480
pretty good

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,640
so we're happy about that and so when

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,640
you get your platform actually has

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,360
document with how to use linux on it

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,559
um and if there's mistakes you can beat

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,760
me up for that one

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:15,679
uh the other one that that um so we

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,679
support team training i kind of do it

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,520
for july some of that was before but

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,760
like all these things as you get close

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,919
to the crunch people start to ask more

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,279
questions and raise more concerns and so

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,520
a lot of it has been that so

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,279
now if what should happen if you call

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,559
our support team instead of saying linux

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,440
isn't supported

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,840
uh they should take your call um they

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,840
are

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,159
obviously new to this so please be nice

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,720
to them if you do have any support calls

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,279
a lot of sport calls are ultimately you

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,720
know

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,360
level one level two and then they will

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,960
come through to to my team

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,880
and you're more likely to get support

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,640
from us but but at least

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,480
i'm hoping the support team will as they

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,679
get more and more um the next experience

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,960
they'll be good so there was

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,440
quite some effort involved there to make

00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,559
sure they were on board and not

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,640
completely panicking um and then the

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,880
last bit july to present so we're

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,840
beginning of august but um we're kind of

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,520
touching this but

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,799
there's lots of paperwork there's lots

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,600
of bits you're like oh can we release to

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,760
the web and

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,919
well you need to have this sign off this

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,200
piece of paper these configurator rules

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,000
uh the web sales there's

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,960
lots of little pieces and it's not until

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
you actually pull the trigger that you

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,080
suddenly find out there's

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,440
other launch logistics that you thought

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,679
you had covered

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,720
so that's why um i know i've had lots of

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,799
questions like where are these

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,480
like and i've been saying it's really

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,840
soon for about a month

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,440
um and it's just taken a little bit so

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,720
it's it's going to be from my point of

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,279
view it's going to be really exciting to

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,320
uh

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:43,600
get the final web sales launcher august

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:46,000
august it is so so there you go

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,240
so i will take a pause and a quick drink

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,240
uh

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,559
scam was anything you noticed that

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,400
so the i answered one of them in the

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,320
chat already but the other one was just

00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,360
are the docs open source um they're

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,720
pretty sure that we get some

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,480
contributors if we

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,400
that's something like that it's a really

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,960
interesting idea but no it's

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,919
not and it's not in a format that can

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,640
open source

00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,440
having been through the pain of editing

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,840
them

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,080
uh which has been a lot better it's i

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:19,200
really like the idea

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,080
but no it's not enough i will take that

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,600
one on board

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,279
i'm not gonna make any promises on that

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,000
one uh

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,880
yeah that will that one would be tough

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,799
again

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,880
bear in mind linux is still small so um

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,919
i do a fair amount of begging and

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,520
wheeling and borrowing

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,120
um so not yet

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,799
um in terms of the in terms of the

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,120
support piece um so

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,159
generally it's only on approved lineups

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,760
so if if you

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,440
have a t-series that that you want to do

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,159
this on um

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,600
reproduce it on ubuntu even if it's just

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,200
boot disk

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,960
that's fine that's good enough you can

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,720
reproduce it on a boot disk ubuntu

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,240
you can probably get support to help you

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,480
out and

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,320
and i will add that so for my team and

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,279
we'll i'll come cover this a bit later

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,760
we do sport we try we try really hard to

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,559
support

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,080
all distros obviously fedora red hat

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,200
help because we have good contacts with

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,240
you guys so

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,400
they they get more priority um

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,000
ubuntu we work with closely as well but

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,399
we try and support all the all the

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,840
others

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:24,399
uh as much as we can usually my

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,679
my experience is most cases nvidia

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,240
drivers aside

00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,960
uh if you fix it on one distro get it

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,880
upstream

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,640
it'll come down into the others we're

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,039
very focused on making sure everything

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,000
goes upstream i don't want

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,679
fixes in one distro and not another i i

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,720
can't cope with that to be honest so

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:46,559
uh yeah our aim is upstream um and

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,520
yeah so on the p73 issue we've discussed

00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,480
a little bit

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,080
um so it is a possibility we we haven't

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,480
decided to pull the trigger on it yet

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,399
uh simply because uh honestly the 17

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,200
inch has a lot lower volumes than the 15

00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,960
inch does

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,840
so we wanted to prioritize that up as

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,840
the more impactful for the community

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,640
um and uh it's kind of interesting there

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,840
was the

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,559
the question about yeah the michelle's

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,039
comment about

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,600
uh getting credit it's an it's an

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,000
interesting

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,679
issue and if anybody has ideas so we

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,919
have quite a few systems that

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,360
people buy as windows and put linux on

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,600
and it's

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,520
how do we track that so that our

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,320
executive team understands that linux is

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,720
important

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,240
um so there is data out there we've been

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,039
using that but if anybody has any

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,840
brilliant ideas

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,399
obviously privacy is important um and we

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,880
don't want to

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,080
invade that but if we can find ways of

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,120
getting numbers and saying

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:47,279
hey yeah there are so many

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,279
millions of fedora users have

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,960
then then that that's good it all helps

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,520
already so

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,640
any last questions on just the timeline

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,080
it's kind of i know it's just an

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,640
overview i'm not allowed to give too

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,159
many

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,840
really details because it's it's

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,760
internal process but i thought it'd be

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,840
interesting just so you when you sit

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,200
then go why does it take so long this is

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,960
why and actually so i just i will look

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,880
back right to that question so

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,559
if we do a new image um we do have to go

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,000
through that testing path to make sure

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,279
it's up to lenovo standards we want to

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,120
make sure our customers have a good

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,480
experience that is absolutely key i get

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,440
shot if our customers don't have a good

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,960
experience

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,760
um energy certification can potentially

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,520
come in

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,520
it depends but yeah if we do an update

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,039
then we have to end this dedication

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,440
again it's another time cost

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,880
exercise uh product product

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,600
documentation you're probably safe on

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,720
unless there's

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,120
major changes um and and then the rest

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,440
is

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,520
fairly easy but just so you understand

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,080
why we don't sit there and just

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,880
do it like this there's stuff that

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,880
happens in the background

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,679
all ready

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,720
uh smoke cool right so the next couple

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,799
of slides

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,320
aren't mine um they're actually taken

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,480
from a presentation that

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,320
uh my phoebus boss used to do for

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,440
customers asking about what lenovo was

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,919
doing with linux

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,440
um i threw them in because they're

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,480
useful they give an overview of what we

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,159
did they it

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,480
covers all the main points and i wanted

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:21,600
to give an idea of what else our team

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,360
does um i'm not going to spend masses of

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,760
time on this unless it triggers any

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,720
particular questions or comments

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,320
um but i mean i'm sure you guys have

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,320
heard about the full config on ubuntu

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,080
and red hat so we have that for

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,600
you know if i know we can't do fedor and

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,880
everything but at least we have linux on

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,720
these platforms and

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,760
you can have pretty good confidence that

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,760
fedora is going to run well

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,559
we've also been doing linux

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,279
certification on the thunderbolt 3

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,159
workstation gen 2. that's a mouthful

00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,919
dark um

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:56,159
i've i've been using it on my p1 gen2 um

00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,279
we still got some bugs on that one but

00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,880
um it's

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:02,640
things like that uh are improving um

00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,320
work with linux distributions component

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,320
drivers lvfs support i will mention that

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,440
again later but lvfs support is very

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,600
important to us

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,200
uh and think lmi i will come to that

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,720
later we do a bunch of

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,480
sales support not surprisingly one of

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,679
the fun pieces of my job i don't do as

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,760
much coding as i used to

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,200
but i get to talk to a lot of customers

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,960
and a lot of linux

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,039
community and things like that which i

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,200
love i love hearing from you guys

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,240
genuinely if you know i try and respond

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,440
as much as possible

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,360
i want to hear what you guys want and so

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,880
i've really enjoyed that side of things

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,279
it's been new for me i used to be

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,399
just a team of one working on kernels or

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,760
network switches

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:43,039
um and never met a customer ever so

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,480
it's been you better but i like i like

00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:47,120
hearing from you guys

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,080
you can bug me um community

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,600
participation is

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,279
very important i think it's the only way

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,320
we can have any success and that

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,799
it's just it's just key uh so we've

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,279
started

00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:59,360
contributing to the kernel um it's new i

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,480
will cover that a little bit later

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,559
we're making sure we partner with

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,399
vendors to deliver improvement support

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:07,519
um which i think is also important

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,519
conference sponsorship hey

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,240
and uh we i do i keep an eye on a number

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,760
of

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,240
uh mailing lists and forums um

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,000
i'll mention those later there's a lot

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,159
of traffic so i

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,679
my filters are a little bit tuned um but

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,200
i try and keep an eye on stuff that's

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,679
lenovo related on

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,519
some few things and i'm open for

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,399
suggestions for other things

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,760
with bamboo issues uh and customer

00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,080
engagement is kind of linked a little

00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,799
bit

00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,840
sport but uh we just you guys know we we

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,679
do customized

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,279
uh pre-loaded offerings for big

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,640
corporate clients um

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,200
probably not of interest here but we do

00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,919
do that post-sale support we do a lot of

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,399
that

00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,279
and we do have a dedicated lenovo linux

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,000
form it has

00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,799
a fedora section on that i'll have the

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,799
link to that

00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,480
shortly and we're encouraging anybody to

00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,080
participate in our lenovo linux forms if

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,440
it's lenovo related

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,960
um hey we we you know we want we want to

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,200
build up our own open source

00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,000
community as well to make sure that

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,760
we're getting

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:15,279
everybody from everywhere all right

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:18,320
uh okay it looks like i triggered a uh

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,519
conversation about this the the one

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,519
question that came through that that

00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:25,760
hadn't been answered yet mark was

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:27,360
if you use obs

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,679
obs that rings a bell but i'm pulling a

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,360
blank it's saturday morning

00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,240
obviously douglas could you expand on

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,240
what you mean by that then

00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,399
no no we don't use open build service

00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,840
now we take it honestly we take so

00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,519
actually that's an interesting question

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,640
though for the fedor one we take the

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,559
image off the web

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,440
that's what we do it's the fedora image

00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:54,720
and so how it works is we install it

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,840
on the platform we add i think three or

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,279
four documents

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:02,320
to slash ops lenovo um

00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:04,000
take a snapshot and then that goes off

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,440
to manufacturing

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,440
so uh we we don't actually build the uh

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,720
fedor image we use what you guys provide

00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,119
and i think that's important

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,399
uh i'd actually be slightly hesitant

00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,200
about us building our own because

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,760
there's

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,599
too much opportunity for us to make

00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,359
changes and

00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,839
i don't know i'd i'd be open to a

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:27,280
discussion on it but i'd rather use

00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:30,320
what the community provides um

00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:33,520
and ryan yes so what's in autonomous the

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,679
uh utterly exciting

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,800
license agreement i think i i've got the

00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,440
list somewhere it's the license

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,359
agreement

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,040
the product document which is actually i

00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:43,359
mean

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,480
you guys wouldn't need it but it's there

00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,079
so um

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,760
that was the third one there's another

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,800
legal thing

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,320
honestly you're not missing out um

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:57,040
yeah legal stuff yeah

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,240
so we and and i will take that as a

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,560
small segue so

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,560
doing open source the right way is

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:05,359
important to us um

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,760
i actually spend a chunk of time uh

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,240
doing

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,000
open source reviews for so i didn't put

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,720
it on my timeline slide part of that i

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,720
do

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,200
when we do an image release i have to go

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,880
to our open

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,240
i source uh see open source coming in

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,480
what the other committee

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,760
but i have to go to them and explain

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,800
exactly what we're putting

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,960
in this image and i have to

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,640
get sign off from an executive that we

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,680
haven't done anything we shouldn't and

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,800
make sure that

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,800
if people want to access what is in the

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,240
image they can do that so we we do

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
actually have quite a few legal checks

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,400
and balances

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,359
and surprisingly and it's something

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,359
which we take seriously

00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:46,400
so

00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,520
uh it's the one the the warranty stuff

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,599
is all tracked separately

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,359
um but there's nothing's in the on the

00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:55,839
image itself

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:57,440
is it i thought it was mentioned

00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,359
there's probably something in there from

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,280
a legal blurb but there's nothing you

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,000
need to do with the files on the phantom

00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,560
oh yeah yeah

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,599
no that's all processed it's just part

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,160
of your purchase

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,960
yeah yeah they will read only files so

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,640
um

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,079
if you're really interested i'll send

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,119
them to you they

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,160
and they should end up on the lenovo

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,440
support website

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,680
once we release that's something i need

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,000
to make sure happens um

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,079
yeah uh so so an answer to your question

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,280
michelle uh the

00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,880
the p53 and the p1 are both mobile

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,800
workstations actually

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,920
so we are supporting it on the

00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,320
workstations already

00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,640
um as in the the next generation the the

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:40,560
p1 gen 3 and the

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:43,040
um p 15 are also mobile workstations

00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,240
if we expand to desktop workstations we

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,960
are still discussing

00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,839
which ones specifically would make the

00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,079
most sense

00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:51,760
i believe most likely we would start

00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:55,040
with the p340

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,000
tower as those are the the entry-level

00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,160
workstations

00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,839
that tend to have a much higher volumes

00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,440
and would give us a broader

00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:05,040
understanding of where the market would

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,040
find use for them and value for them

00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,960
the we we could very well do the p520 as

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,440
well um that that's

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,160
a lot of it is going to be um and for

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,520
the for the facebook request i mean if

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,520
if uh that's something that's

00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,520
interesting to you by all means i'll be

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,880
happy to have a conversation

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,079
we can we can definitely we can

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,720
definitely look at doing it as long as

00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,400
we have

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,839
um some some understanding of what the

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,240
volume and demand is for

00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,240
the product

00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:37,839
[Laughter]

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,839
all righty um

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,640
cool all right so again this is another

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,400
slide i kind of threw it up there i'll

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,119
i'll go over quickly it's a little bit

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,800
repetitive

00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,079
previous one but it was a whole slide

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,359
that i could add a presentation without

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,720
spending time writing

00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:55,119
um so just from a support point of view

00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,320
you know what it it really is is

00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,800
repetitive but just

00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,240
just to outline some of the pieces we do

00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,000
working with partners

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,320
uh working with the community answering

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,839
lots of questions debugging um

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,440
i actually am going to have a support

00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,760
related question for you guys

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,720
when i get to the end um remind me if i

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,000
forget

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,280
so i don't i i was a bit worried about

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,480
time partly why i put this in but

00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,960
there's been so many questions i'm just

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,480
going to

00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,720
roll on so what else

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,880
uh so i mentioned it there's the lenovo

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,960
linux forums you can go there if you go

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,720
you will find there is a fedora section

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,400
there too um and

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,720
anybody's welcome to contribute it's not

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,200
a lenovo employee thing only i

00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,880
i spend a bunch of time on there uh i

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,599
haven't this week i've been busy

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,079
um but i you know my team oh they

00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,880
actually all have in their um

00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,920
we have internal rates you know tasks

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,440
that you have to do

00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,119
and they all have they have to spend so

00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,079
much time on on the forum answering

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,599
questions

00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,640
um so we we try there if uh if you can't

00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,160
get ahold of me that's a good place to

00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,599
go there are other people in lenovo who

00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,160
will be looking at it and

00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,599
if if you see a fedora related question

00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,720
on there and you know the answer

00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:09,599
please jump in um so

00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,200
i mentioned earlier i you know trying to

00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,480
become a better member of the open

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,760
source community

00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,640
trying to listen uh on the mailing list

00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,280
and answer questions or if issues come

00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,280
up

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,960
where we can help find the solution do

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,720
that so uh

00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,320
i kind of threw in this was a little bit

00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,400
just off top of my head but mainly list

00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,520
that i've participated in and i know

00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,079
others of the team have too

00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,800
so um this view of course the fedora

00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,040
devel

00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,119
uh group is there i keep an eye on that

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,040
if if you want something to hit my inbox

00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,040
put it on there but put the word

00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,560
lenovo in it and it does get filled out

00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,520
i do check the other messages i followed

00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,359
the butter fs

00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,960
uh discussion with interest that was

00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,880
interesting um

00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,480
but but yeah and and i do feel about

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,280
anything that has mentioned lenovo

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,400
specifically

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,200
um it comes up into my uh inbox

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,359
um i will say uh yeah always looking for

00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,920
audio experts i i still feel like we're

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:02,240
missing

00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,839
stuff on audio audio experts who if

00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:07,680
you're out there you guys are golden

00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:10,960
um so um

00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:14,160
and the last one lvfs there is actually

00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,480
a um i'm not sure what the right word is

00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,760
but

00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,000
there's a there's a a forum

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,359
on there firmware lenovo thinkpad i'm

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,800
going to mention this one specifically

00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,800
there's um

00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,000
kathleen who's in the team on japan in

00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,880
japan who uh so i was trying to improve

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,760
how much uh how we responded to firmware

00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,680
update issues

00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,040
we get a few of them it seems to be

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,200
still new and

00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,960
and actually it's an inter uh yeah maybe

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,119
channel slightly uh incidentally a

00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,480
real shout out for um richard hughes red

00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,119
hat for the work he's done that's

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,000
amazing

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,400
um but we you know trying to improve how

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,440
we

00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:52,480
monitor and answer answer users

00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,599
calls and um there this uh

00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,040
came came orlean uh name popped up

00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:59,200
and and was answering all these

00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,240
questions and i was like who is this i

00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,680
don't know them so

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,920
and she's actually working with a team

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,160
in japan and they had recognized the

00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,960
same need it was not driven by me

00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,200
they had recognized it and they were

00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,480
she's now participating so

00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,079
from my point of view that's really

00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,800
exciting because it means lenovo's

00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,880
getting it

00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,119
and there's things happening outside of

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,200
our team so uh i i obviously have worked

00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:23,200
with her now uh and that's good but

00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,240
for me that was like this is good it's

00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:28,079
growing and

00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,079
it's it's important so um

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,920
so were there any specific questions

00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,440
about like

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,680
the mailing lists or the forms or

00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,839
anything on that that i can address

00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,680
before i move on and just have another

00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,119
little pause

00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,960
it looked like it was carrying on with a

00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,160
mdg so i might the md1

00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,640
will come back if there's anything

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,599
specific at the end um

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,839
i'm going to mention think lmi uh it's a

00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,599
product that uh it's

00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,119
a long word application that we've just

00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,480
released publicly on

00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:02,400
github uh so it's kind of our first

00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:05,599
first one um it's a utility to

00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:09,280
provide access to the bios wmi settings

00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:11,680
uh so you can go and get and set

00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,000
your bios settings using the wmi

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,160
interface if you come across that

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,520
there's two parts to it a kernel driver

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,440
a user space utility

00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,200
so uh we've been working on it

00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,000
internally we got it got approval to put

00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,240
it up and

00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,319
put it up on github and have it public

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,359
uh the kernel driver i would like to get

00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:29,680
that into the kernel

00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:31,440
it's the quality is not ready yet we're

00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:34,800
currently undergoing review

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,480
to make sure it's really um

00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,560
solid and then we'll start the

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,400
challenging kernel review process

00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,520
but the plan is to get that upstream

00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,760
into the kernel and then it will just be

00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,240
the

00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,960
space utility i'm hoping eventually i

00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,720
can come to

00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,640
fedor and say hey can i package think

00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:51,520
lmi is a user space utility

00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,960
um but i realize that's down the road a

00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,520
little bit i need the kernel driver in

00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,280
first

00:42:53,520 --> 00:43:00,640
so if you're interested in that

00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:05,760
check it out um ask questions

00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:08,640
participate for the usual yeah exactly

00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,119
yeah yeah it didn't seem worth doing

00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,599
that so

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,280
just answering neil's question about it

00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,560
we i think we i think

00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,880
i'll take guidance on this but i think

00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,200
we need the colonel part in first before

00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,040
it

00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,720
it's really useful i don't want people

00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,359
installing a user

00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,319
and i don't can't imagine going down the

00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:28,960
road of having a

00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:33,040
avatary kernel driver is much fun again

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:35,359
if i'm wrong let me know um and i just

00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,480
mentioned these uh we have started

00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,880
contributing to the colonel

00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,760
uh for me personally this has been

00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,280
really cool i

00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,560
i've worked on the linux kernel with

00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,319
networking switches for a while and it

00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,839
was always i was not allowed

00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,520
to contribute on stream which i'm sure

00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:49,599
is fairly common in

00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,680
different companies you take but you

00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:55,040
don't get back and it frustrated me

00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,240
um so i think it's i'm really happy that

00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,760
i'm able to start

00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:03,040
contributing back to to the community so

00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,760
we've had uh there's a lap mode sensor

00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,720
it's um basically your pc's on this one

00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,680
lap so that

00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,359
has been submitted and accepted uh we

00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,880
have a similar on this palm sense on not

00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,480
all platforms at some of you there's a

00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,200
palm sensor usually in the bottom left

00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,040
corner

00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,319
sometimes right uh and it can tell if

00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,280
you know you've got your hands resting

00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:22,560
on the keyboard

00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,160
so that's currently in progress um and i

00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,400
just responded some questions just

00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,880
yesterday uh and then the last one which

00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,359
will be

00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,560
more interesting so um for anybody who

00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:34,319
followed the

00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:38,079
thermal mode issues with dptf not being

00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:40,079
open sourced so lenovo has their

00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,520
their special firmware for linux that

00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,319
essentially

00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,520
reproduces what dptf does so that we can

00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:48,880
it senses

00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:51,040
it changes the uh different

00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,400
performance mode so if you put it in

00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,599
high performance mode it will

00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,880
run faster but harder and if you you can

00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,560
put in low performance mode and get

00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,319
longer battery life and if you put it on

00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,760
your lap it will automatically drop out

00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:04,960
of high performance mode so

00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,720
you don't hurt yourself um so we've had

00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,839
that already it all works automatically

00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,480
in background but we're working on

00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:11,920
putting in

00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:14,319
some changes in the kernel so that um

00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,359
users can control it more easily uh

00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,640
there's some stuff

00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:19,359
we're working on with somebody at red

00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:21,200
hat to get a known user control

00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,880
to do it and just generally to make that

00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,000
more linux friendly right now it's all

00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,160
through

00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,599
function hotkeys and we'd like to

00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:32,079
actually make that more

00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:35,359
accessible to everybody so um

00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:37,760
so yeah uh i will say you know that uh

00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,560
the colonel community has been great uh

00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,880
but

00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:43,920
they teach you teach you where you make

00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:48,240
mistakes which is as it should be

00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:50,400
all right haha so i made it to the end

00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,680
um and i haven't left enough time for we

00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:56,720
have lots of questions since we went

00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,720
along so uh what did i miss john

00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,160
nothing that i did miss as well oh

00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,240
fingerprints

00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,079
langdon white fingerprints yes we have

00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,040
think film ready works it works

00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:11,680
a few so all of the fedora laptops x1

00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,040
carbonate pyr53 p102 the fingerprint

00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,200
reader works

00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,319
i assume that's what you're asking about

00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,920
um because that's

00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:20,480
usually what i get on the fingerprints

00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,520
uh all of our 2020 platforms

00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,960
and i was looking at a spreadsheet

00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,400
yesterday to confirm we've got all of

00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,680
our 2020 platforms

00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:30,960
the fingerprint reader should work um

00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:33,760
the older ones um uh

00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,200
no so it's down to the vendors there's

00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,480
two different technologies match on chip

00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,599
match on host

00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,920
uh the chip vendors really don't want to

00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,359
do

00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,680
the match on host because they're

00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:46,720
worried about exposing their ip

00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,000
um so it's difficult we it has to come

00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,280
from the vendor and

00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,280
they don't want to do it so what we've

00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:56,560
done is make sure going forward that are

00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:59,280
make certified platforms what

00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,280
all ready

00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:08,160
uh question from ben what's the user

00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:12,000
experience like with unboxing

00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:13,839
do they get no it's the usual

00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,640
so it's the usual so this is what i'm

00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:19,200
saying when we we take

00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,559
uh these yeah no they get the standard

00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,640
uh user set up

00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:24,000
we don't have a pre user you get it

00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,240
it'll boot up and it launches in the

00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,440
uh i think yeah the known the gnome

00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:30,880
setup

00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:32,559
the out of out of box experience uh

00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,640
anyway yeah it's it's standard

00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,960
yeah no i wouldn't want to change that

00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,800
pre-installed users would be bad

00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,920
so you can go set your country your time

00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,920
zone blah blah blah

00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:49,599
a cool boot sorry no

00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:53,839
just no i know why

00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,839
but yeah that's not even on my radar

00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,640
that's that bear in mind we sell windows

00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:01,359
laptops

00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,359
that would be hard

00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:09,520
file system partitioning

00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,359
uh whatever's standard with uh fedora so

00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,800
right now it is ext

00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:14,559
three or four i should know the answer

00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,680
to that one someone's gonna go but yeah

00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,319
it's the default we don't we don't

00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,440
change that

00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:23,119
so uh we have followed the

00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:25,359
discussions about butter fs and i think

00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,960
if you guys go with butter fest we'll

00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:30,800
follow that standard

00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:33,040
unless it has major of the xtf okay

00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,760
unless it has major performance issues

00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:38,880
particularly on the workstations where

00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:41,040
performance is key so uh yeah

00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,319
if if that's what you guys are using as

00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,599
your default we

00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,960
almost certainly will unless there's

00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,760
problems with it and if there's problems

00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,920
with it

00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,960
i suggest that maybe it's not the right

00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,359
choice but um

00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,200
i i know i've had some discussions like

00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,960
if it doesn't work we can

00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,559
switch to something else there was a way

00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,680
of doing it but uh

00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:02,720
but yeah honestly our aim is

00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:05,760
we provide we're doing fedora on

00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:09,040
these for fedora users so

00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,960
really we should be we you know

00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,800
you're our you're our customers you you

00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,559
tell us what you want and

00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,200
that's that's what's that's what's

00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:19,599
really important um we just want to make

00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,040
sure it works well on our laptop so

00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,440
yeah try and avoid doing something

00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:31,520
anything that makes it not work well but

00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:34,400
that sounds like a normal situation

00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:36,640
so uh island that'd be cool keep me in

00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,200
the post on that let me know uh i don't

00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,400
do myself i haven't really looked after

00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,520
the uh

00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,720
creating the image for uh manufacturing

00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,440
and that side of things but i have some

00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:49,839
experts on my team who do um but

00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,280
if if you've got some work there then

00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:52,160
let me know we'd we'd love to know

00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,040
what's happening

00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,359
uh if we can contribute that's great too

00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,839
uh

00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:59,839
we'd like to do that

00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:05,839
how much testing do you uh

00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:08,079
so ben yeah it's an interesting question

00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:10,880
short answer is not a lot to be honest

00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:12,960
uh it tends to happen more as the crunch

00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:16,720
comes up for

00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,720
for doing that so um

00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:24,160
we i mean we we did for the x1 carbon a

00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,440
p1 gen 2 p53 just because of how it

00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,119
lined up with the cycle

00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,760
it worked out kind of well like we did

00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:32,400
have the early releases

00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,240
and we were testing with those and you

00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:37,280
know finding issues and raising them

00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,200
and you know i'm assuming we're going to

00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,319
do the x1 carbon 9 next year

00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,440
it would be weird not to um but i'm not

00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:46,240
committing to that

00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,520
key point but i'm assuming that as we do

00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,800
more platforms

00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,720
then it'll be the same thing but we

00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,880
don't really have yet

00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,079
a process of just doing continuous

00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,079
testing uh

00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,559
it's something which i do have on my

00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:01,680
to-do list some sort of automated

00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:04,079
test set up so we can catch these things

00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,520
um before ideally i would like to catch

00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:09,200
these things before

00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:11,839
you know our users really do um

00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,920
but it's not these promises especially

00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:15,599
covered we have we have

00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,599
we somewhere i have charts on we're

00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,480
setting up a remote lab with access to

00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:22,000
units and that

00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:28,000
uh covert kind of mothballed that so uh

00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,000
we think i might gonna frozen

00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:32,559
if you can still hear me right now my

00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,760
screen is frozen so

00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:38,800
ah there we go okay i don't know if i

00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:41,839
went all slow for a bit there

00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,040
so yeah no there's that there is

00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:45,599
one one of the nice things with the

00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:49,119
linux is honestly there is so much scope

00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:53,599
for things to do is huge um

00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:53,599
so lots of lots of room for improvement

00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,760
uh so ben i have had discussions with

00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,400
adam

00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,920
um i don't know that we've particularly

00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,520
