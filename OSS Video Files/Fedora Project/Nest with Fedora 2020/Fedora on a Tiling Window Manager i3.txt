	00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,200
so i'm going to talk about what is the

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,559
i3 window manager what is the tilling

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,679
window manager

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,679
and specifically what is i3 uh what's

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,720
the word what we are doing in the fedora

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,199
i36

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,160
what objective we have what our next

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,760
step

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,920
and we i'm going to talk a little bit

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,199
about the development cycle and the

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,480
testing cycle we have

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,800
and to finish i'm going to

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,960
share how you can get involved with the

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,960
things you're interested in anyway

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,559
so what is the i3 window manager uh in

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,239
first place a window manager is the

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,200
software that controls the position of

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,520
the windows

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,800
in your graphical environment um

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,520
for example when you open uh the genome

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,199
shell or

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,920
or the plasma desktop the software when

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,719
you click

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,600
an application this the software that

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,000
put the window

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,920
around the application that's the window

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,600
manager it's not the plasma plasma

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,280
is a combination of of things that

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,799
allows you to present the windows to the

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,200
window manager and the window manager is

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,600
the

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,040
they want to create the space where the

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,439
window is going to be

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,799
draw in the in the in the graphical

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,560
environment so

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,400
uh there is a difference between uh

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,560
wind tilling window manager and the

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,320
desktop environment in terms of

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,840
what they do a willing a tailing window

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,439
manager just put

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,040
the um each window as a tile that is

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,000
what's called dealing with managers

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,320
it's like you are putting tile nets to

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,759
each other but never overlapping one

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,079
over the other

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,520
and the desktop environment normally use

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,479
the desktop metaphor the desktop

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,000
metaphor is like

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:53,439
a try try the desktop environment

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,280
like it was uh like it is a desktop a

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,399
physical desktop when you can put

00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,560
a notebook and add a pencil over it

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,680
and you can have all the things that

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,759
you're supposed to have

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,960
over a desktop in the case of window

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,439
manager they just

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,160
have uh they track each windows as a

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,319
tile

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,239
okay so you can have a put the things uh

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,400
one next to each other over order but

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,720
not overlapping

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,400
so the i3 window manager is a tilling

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,120
window manager that is reading

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,520
from scratch trying to emulate a little

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,200
bit

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,640
what was uh the double mai

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:34,720
window manager but they tried to

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,400
make it they have to accomplish two

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,080
objectives one is to be

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,879
easier for users to

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,440
er to use and the other one was that was

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,640
well

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,800
well documented so the the great

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,080
objective they have was to make it

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,959
easier for developers

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,680
to know how to build stuff around the

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,680
window manager

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,159
so the fluorite receipt our goal was to

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,599
make i3 more approachable and

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:13,040
useful for fedora users so because i3

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:16,480
is intended to be used for

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,120
power users advanced user developers

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,640
and this kind of a specific and

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,680
environment of users or

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,799
niche of users uh but

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,799
in terms of fedora we want to make it

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,560
more approachable to all users not only

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,599
to advanced users so

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,400
we are trying to make um a desktop

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,959
environment

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,560
based in i3 window manager so it's not a

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,840
desktop environment as well it's just a

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,040
tiling window manager

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,680
install from from scratching fedora so

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,000
you don't

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,040
rely on the desktop environment like

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,519
genome or kde or xfce

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,120
you are you realize your desktop only in

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,280
the i3 window manager

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,159
and where the idea is to make it easier

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,200
for users to

00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:02,560
to start using this kind of

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,720
different metaphor of a desktop

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,280
so we create the what in fedora is

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,000
called a special interest group or a sig

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,879
to work and creating this spin with i3

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,799
as a main window manager so

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,239
this just a lot of people that are

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,680
interested in having a

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,600
fedora i3 window manager just directly

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,960
over the

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,759
linux operating system not relying uh

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,479
over all their desktops so then the way

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,360
you can have

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,320
uh telling window manager now is or or

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,120
take the

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,600
basic image the everything image and

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,240
install

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,280
every package from scratch or put it

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,960
over

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:46,800
uh a workstation or

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,639
any other spin so our idea is to create

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,639
a spin that boot directly in entry and

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,160
you can access directly the i3 window

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,800
manager without having any other

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,800
dependency

00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,800
below so

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,000
our friend justin fleury they create

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,880
this document that is

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,759
so beautiful that it is it's called the

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,280
design goals for this fedora i36

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,919
so the idea is to to have um

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,120
a guidelines of what or how we are going

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,680
to do

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,320
the things inside the fedora 36 the

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,600
first is

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,720
simple is better than complex

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,840
so the idea is that the desktop should

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,199
be usable

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,400
for for everyone not only for fedora

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,400
for advanced users

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,840
give me a second place i

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:47,120
so the other uh the second

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,080
place is uh that fast is better than

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,639
figures the

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,479
idea is that we are having a minimalist

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,680
environment that's the idea of the i3

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,280
that it keeps

00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:07,840
things really really small

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:07,840
i really really work fast

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:21,840
just give me a second that i'm having

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:21,840
some background noise here

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,800
okay sorry i have a background noise i

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,960
don't know

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,960
where it comes from but no it's better

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,880
oh hello nasir

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:47,199
hello edwards sorry it's a

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,599
power issue at my side so i don't have

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,639
any lights around

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,960
no problem yeah so

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,039
i was working uh talking about our

00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,639
design goals that were

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,960
reading by justin and the idea is that

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,960
there is

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,479
keep trying to to have the scene fast

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,560
and have the

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,240
the environment working really really

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,759
fast instead of having the

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,000
all the features inside so the idea is

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,240
that

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,680
making a thing that works fast and and

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,160
with a low

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,160
uh number of resources the other

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,880
part is that we there should be one and

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,880
probably only one obvious way to do it

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:35,280
in the i3c people normally

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,520
create an environment that worked for

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,400
for them you create your own workflow

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,720
inside the i3 window manager

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,960
but we are trying to to do the basic

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,919
computing stuff uh

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,599
directly in the in the i36 so you don't

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:53,680
need to

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:56,240
to look for a lot of new stuff to put in

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,440
more than they were the the one that is

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,560
specific to you

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:04,080
so we're trying to make um

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,479
the window at the i3 window manager um

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,240
comfortable to use and now it's better

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,280
than never

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,240
is the last one that is about the we try

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,479
to choose an experiment with new ideas

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,800
uh trying to know don't break the other

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,720
design goals so when a new package

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,720
is there we are going to try it and see

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,560
is this work better than

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,160
than the other one and if it works

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,960
better for us we are going to replace

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,960
the the old one

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,000
sorry

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,719
so now uh thanks to nasser that is

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,320
present now here we have a functionality

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:45,040
iso 3 respin with the item manager that

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,760
is ready for testing that is the the

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,040
thing that i'm using in my screen now

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,360
and the next step will be provide

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,440
help with packaging and choose the

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,320
package that we want to have in our spin

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,000
and make it easier to users to grab them

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,560
if they don't choose the

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,519
to use the iso in the same way that you

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,200
can do

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:10,880
um dnf install

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:14,320
uh group install

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,000
genome or kde the idea is to create a

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,519
group package that you can

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,480
just say dnf install i3

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,000
core and you have the basic stuff or i3

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,240
extended that is the other part

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,440
and when we have a lot of application

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,440
that people

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,800
that advance users or people that

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,000
normally use the

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,839
i3 window manager have in

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,839
in their environments

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:45,279
so in this part i'm going to pass to

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:51,519
nazir to talk about our development

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:54,560
cycle and the testing environment

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,680
uh thank you edward so am i audible now

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,160
because i'm on the data plan that we

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,880
have

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,880
i'm audible

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,200
uh great so uh with development and

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,760
testing

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,120
edward you can you move to the next or

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,120

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,200
uh let's keep it at your side so the i3

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,440
window manager that we currently have is

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,560
packaged and maintained by dan celmac

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,880
defolos is a snake or fast id

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,920
he is currently one of the core members

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,959
of the i3 sig

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,680
as well and he is maintaining i3 related

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,560
packages

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,560
and the i3 main package in the fedora

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
repositories

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,600
so am i gone i don't know what's

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,720

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:23,920
continuously uh until now we are working

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,480
we have i think we have already two

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,000
months

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,079
almost working in the i3 seek

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,760
and the work is being awesome the guys

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,720
heard the feedback the

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,560
the help that nasir does with a with the

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,600
iso creation the kickstart file and

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,959
everything

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,000
uh they flows in the packaging and

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,040
southern

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,279
in the uh publishing of the

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,440
of the iso with the other spins

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,760
is the feedback has been really really

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,760
great

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,959
uh for a quick demo okay i'm running my

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:06,639
the i3 window manager but i have

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:10,959
a heavy heavy customized

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:13,839
so let me see if i can

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:16,399
launch a virtual machine i have but i'm

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:20,480
not sure if it's going to work

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,480
sorry i don't have this part preparing

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,440
no i don't have a a demo so i'm going to

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,399
share my screen

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,759
again but please remember that this is

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,839
not the final look because

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,560
my environment is heavily heavily

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,560
customized

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:55,839
or

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:55,839
let me see let's try

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,360
okay so this is my full desktop i have

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,399
two screens

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,399
one word with a

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,639
with a slideshow that is this one on the

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,600
left

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,600
on your left

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,839
so

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,600
the idea of the window manager is that

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:37,839
windows are tried as styles

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:41,920
so you can do this

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:44,160
and the windows don't get overlapped

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:50,800
unless you want it okay no it's not that

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:53,120
is impossible

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,160
so you can uh play with the position of

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,160
the windows and

00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,399
they are going to be a show as styles as

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,399
uh

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,600
in the positions you really want to have

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,360
them

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,880
without losing your functionality one

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,679
thing that i love in

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,160
in i3 is that you move your mouse and

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,959
the

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,600
focus is moved to the window that the

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,679
mouse is

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,439
on so you don't have to click it you

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,679
just move the mouse and the focus is

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,679
there

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,919
and now another thing that i really

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:40,640
really love of the i36

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:43,760
i don't know if you can see my my bar

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,280
i i have this custom mice but there is

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,039
also a system area

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,559
where you can have the this the the

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,320
sister eye icons

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,000
that as normally they are normally

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,760
called sister eye icons

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,360
for those applications that you need to

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,160
have the i3 the

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,799
the icon under there for example network

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,120
for example

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:03,200
value for example if you need to put a

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,320
calendar

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,360
in my case i do have the telegram and my

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:14,160
my the keepassxc uh

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:17,200
i3 is a is shipped with um

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:20,160
a menu that is called the menu but i

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,280
uh i don't use it but i have the the

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:28,960
other d menu

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:31,679
if you if you look here

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,440
is this bar over here in the top of the

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,039
window where you can type the comment

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:43,840
you are going to run

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:43,840
for example network

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,360
to launch the network icon and now i

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,559
have my network icon

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,799
over here so i can list the networks i

00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,799
have

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,880
uh i have a other menu that is called

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,360
rofi

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,400
that works in more like in the metaphor

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:13,280
of the desktop with a floating window

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,000
and it works with the desktop files the

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,160
menu

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,240
normally work with the desktop files i

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:22,000
just have the the command line one

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,850
that works directly with the comments

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,360
and the other thing that you um

00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,120
[Music]

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,720
that the window manager do for you is

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,840
that you can have uh

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,039
in the actual window you can have

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,000
floating windows if the in case you need

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:38,080
to

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,480
have a window in the desktop metaphor so

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,480
you can

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,120
uh there are other stuff that is called

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,320
the

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:55,520
the in the in the way that i3 works that

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,520
is called the the three

00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,440
the three metaphor then they put all the

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,320
windows in in

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,880
the form of trees in boolean trees if

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,960
you are

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,840
familiar with programming and you can

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,600
move from

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,880
[Music]

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,720
between the notes of the three and you

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,520
can re-parent a window to

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,919
to be a master or a parent node but

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,240
that's

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:22,720
uh a little advanced topics

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,720
so let me just grab this again

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,880
and to finish uh the ways where you can

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:31,440
get involved you can just

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,320

and we can put the link in the in the

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,440
chat

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,880
and we have the telegram channel that is

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,840
fedora i3c and our mailing list is i3wm

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,480
at least.fedoraproject.org so i hope to

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,480
see you soon

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,840
any question

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,640
yes yes we did it

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,640
itamar thanks for the comment yes we

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,880
do have the kickstarter repo and we have

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,960
the publicated before on the

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,080
recipient sites i don't i'm not sure why

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,320
it's not now

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,320
probably we missed the the lattice build

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,000
so if there is another question about it

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,600
you can test it uh

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,600
we are having some issues like for

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,159
example the when

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,799
when you launch the live iso there is no

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,799
wallpaper

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,760
but when you install it the wallpaper of

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,280
the fedora 32

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,559
is there so the first thing that happens

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,240
when you launch i3

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,840
is that you have the configuration

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,280
manager that to allow you to

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,679
choose your uh

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,480
your mod key that's a little more

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,520
advanced uh

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:49,200
usage of the ice

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,200
of the i3 window manager

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:57,200
so if there is no other question so

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,640
i will leave uh i have the links in the

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,799

a basic environment but trying to have

it an environment that works

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,600
out of the box that you don't need to

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:32,240
install too many things to make it work

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,360
