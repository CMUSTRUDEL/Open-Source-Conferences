okay so

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,799
hi everyone i think i don't know if we

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,160
can see how many people are in the

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,800
session or not but um welcome everyone

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,320
that's here

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,759
my name is justin um most of you

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,440
probably know me but

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,199
only thing that's maybe worth noting is

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,600
i've been involved with comm ops on and

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,600
off for the last five years

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,640
and most of the things i do in comm-ops

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,960
are

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,480
more of the non-engineering

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,800
side of things although i have done a

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,800
little bit of code and metrics work time

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,079
to time just not a lot

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,079
i'll pass it to alberto

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:46,239
okay i'm alberto

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:50,719
i'm from mexico i love the matrix

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:53,199
work with data and also i'm

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,320
contributing to the fedora project with

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,680
coming ups

00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,199
i love commerce is my first

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,280
group where i start in the fedora

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,400
project

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,200
and also this is the first time that i

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,520
leave

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,520
a workshop maybe

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,320
hacking

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:22,240
session or whatever

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:26,720
this is is this um

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:30,640
i'm i also very shy

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:35,520
i need to practice more my english so i

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,520
maybe i will be a little

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,119
i will not be the better speaker but

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,640
i will try to help in everything we need

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,079
to do here

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,759
and also i want to do

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:58,640
this this session uh

00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:01,200
i i always see a lot of

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,439
data from the federal project about the

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,200
community

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,399
i would like to show to the project all

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,720
the the

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:15,440
fantastic uh stats we have

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,720
by example for the diversity team i

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,959
don't know

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,959
how they do

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,120
the uh dynamizing world

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,800
with i only see maybe

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,800
10 10 persons

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,680
working and had a lot of impact in the

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,519
project

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:43,760
is amazing so

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,760
another part the packagers

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,200
we need more but he do also an amazing

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,440
word

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:56,480
a packaging a lot of software

00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:00,800
and also we need to show

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,879
to the project they work um

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,239
and they in general the community of

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,840
fedora is

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:11,519
very diverse so i want to show

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,319
that but i don't know what topic to

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,000
choice is

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:20,879
is my my first impression we need to

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,879
choice a topic about this first

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,040
a blog entry

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:35,440
makes sense so i have a few ideas on

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,280
maybe ways to start the conversation

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,360
maybe just before we jump into that

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,159
nasir did you want to introduce yourself

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,480
really quick too

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:47,680
for everyone okay so i'm nasa osan i'm

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,400
relatively really new to new to fedora

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,280
than alberto or justin

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,120
i work with the fedora joint team in

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,400
order to improve the newcomer experience

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,680
with fedora

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,879
and lee working on some

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,120
core stuff and some other diversity and

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,959
inclusion and a little bit of come up so

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,799
i would be participating in the workshop

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,280
today

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,280
awesome

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:20,639
so alberto maybe before

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,840
we talk about the

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,560
questions to ask do you want to

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,320
on screen share show the maps that

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,840
you've already made and maybe

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:35,280
talk about or introduce the geo fp

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,800
fedora community stats tool really quick

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,560
just so that way we'll all be on the

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,040
same page yeah of course

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,040
um cool let me show you

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,639
i was just looking i opened the maps on

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,240
a new tab and i was like whoa

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:57,440
they're actually clickable this is

00:04:50,240 --> 00:05:02,560
really cool

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,560
joey fb here

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,919
i drew some

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,960
um community

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:23,600
they are this map is from

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,800
all the community a

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:31,360
active community

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,360
using the using

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,160
a daytime from the

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,600
january 1st of this year

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:45,360
so everyone was not

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:48,960
using the

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,960
every login platform

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,840
or fast platform or the first account

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:59,280
in some side of the fedora project

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:04,080
is done called because he if

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:07,039
we come all we call the filtering

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,680
we get all the accounts of the fedora

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,840
project is

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:16,639
i love the wacoms more of the of

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:20,640
now say i ten thousand more

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:23,360
but update people where by example on

00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,919
[Music]

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,919
pakistan

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:34,639
we had a wedding at it from

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,960
january 1st no i don't actually i don't

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,080
know

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,720
what the people are doing but i know i

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,759
know

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:45,759
they are active right

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:49,320
so is one of the filters other filters

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,840
can be from by example

00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,880
[Music]

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,800
by by group

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,800
i we have the ambassadors

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,960
by example germany had

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,960
22.

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:17,840
i i can view all the

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,840
the data in the maps is cool

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,319
we can do manual many other filters for

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,840
the data

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:29,199
actually the principal data source is

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,840
the the fast system so on

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,840
one of the

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:39,840
the purpose of this session is also

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:42,479
um make uh some wrappers for the new

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,360
freipa implementation of the

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,840
authentication

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,840
on fedora

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:54,639
so used for

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:58,000
maintaining this kind of of stats

00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:02,319
we need also combined new data source

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:06,080
like data reaper fedora messaging

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,080
to get more accurate

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:15,840
filters about activity groups

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:19,440
i don't know comments from

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,440
a particular repo or

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,400
i don't know many people want to see who

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,919
where is the people can help in some

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,399
part of the project is

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:36,719
this is good looking the code

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,719
is very simple actually

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,839
this is not this

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,440
as you put icicle is mostly

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:17,040
a python class at first we

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,720
think in on it uh like a python class

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,480
because

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:26,480
we can use to develop more software

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,480
over that class so

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,480
i don't know if it is fine to see

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,480
that

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,600
in in

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:53,279
it looks fine oh i need to watch

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,560
what is the source

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:59,519
for um

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,000
activity like what what gets somebody to

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,200
appear

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,800
on the map for any of these

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:10,079
by example we load the

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:14,079
the data from effect

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:17,279
by example by group this

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:20,480
method here uh

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:23,680
get this so you're you're hitting

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:28,320
fast and not fed message

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,839
right right okay because fit benches

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,839
don't have had information about the

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:37,279
user doing some activity

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:42,320
but don't have the

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,320
geographical localization or the

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:51,680
what this is the

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,680
the who is

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,480
the country code of the

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,600
of the account so we actually see the

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,959
country code

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:06,160
also we have a some

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:10,480
some other geographical information like

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:15,839
um is is the

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,839
get more minute

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:30,640
oh what's happening now let me

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,640
what is happening here

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:42,720
where is my where is

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:45,839
okay i choose by example the advocates

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,839
i say okay

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,279
um i didn't see

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,800
oh yeah i see what you mean the screen

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,399
is uh

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,639
oh is that it i think it's that it's

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:05,360
minimized in the corner there

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,360
see the tiny window i don't see it

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,839
it is go hit the super key

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:19,920
upright yeah so tiny

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,920
i'm happy okay

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,440
it is by it's simple at the invaders

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,600
oh we have the time zone this is

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,639
important

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,639
also we have

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:38,320
longitude and latitude of if

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,760
we proper if we get that data from the

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,519
fast account

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:46,560
is good we can by example

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:51,360
generate much from

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,360
maybe the open street maps happy and

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:57,120
and get the position of the people where

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,120
it's simple for

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:05,200
a flock okay this will

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,200
will be cool if we need to

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,839
uh follow one of the more

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,560
partners by example when we go

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,560
to the party

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,480
no it's just an idea

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:26,079
yeah i guess my i have

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:30,000
two questions one

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:32,959
about the new authentication

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,680
stuff with fedora infra i was just

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,839
wondering

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,839
have you have you followed that do you

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,880
know if that will break

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:44,560
a lot of what you're doing now or

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:49,199
will it still work i i don't know uh

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:52,480
mostly all the code will work

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:55,120
because most of the fields key

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,440
that i use in the files account system

00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,440
will be ported to the new

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,519
free implementation so

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,000
we don't have too much problem with that

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:11,920
only need to

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:15,519
change the a how to get the data from

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,240
from from the new free but will be a

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,560
recipe

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:24,160
i think yes a free recipe from

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,720
from the frappe so mostly

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,279
i don't know i don't need all the

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,320
information also why it can flow

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:36,000
by example for the maps i only need

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:39,120
the country code maybe the longitude

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,639
the latitude the time zone is important

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,639
and some others

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,600
daytime basset information like for

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,560
example

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,199
my by example the creation the status

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,800
change

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:57,920
and the lasting fields

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,279
looks great because i can by a simple

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,720
determinant

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:06,480
ah if some atom is a

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:10,079
university now is is

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:13,440
is not deep inactive

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:16,720
for some time

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:21,279
last scene is that the last login

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:24,560
or the last last edit last login okay

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:27,760
it's the last login in one of the

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:31,199
fedora project platinum platforms like

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:35,839
i don't know anywhere not just fast

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,839
not just fast by example um

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,040
um i did not know that i thought it was

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,480
just fast

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:50,480
every example uh as

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:53,440
ask fedora too every

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,079
a system can use actually the first

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,360
account

00:15:54,079 --> 00:16:00,800
for authentication they

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,680
imply a implicitly implicitly changed

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,279
the

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:09,120
field so we can more or less

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:11,839
be accurate if some someone don't

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,839
looking for

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,360
the idea is maybe he is not active

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:28,079
so we use that field for

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:28,079
filtering active people also we have um

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,000
um worries

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,519
active fail in the fast that means when

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,279
someone

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:44,320
says okay i want to make it connected

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:47,519
make unactive my account

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:53,279
we have the field to

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:57,199
status so we have a lot of active

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:58,639
front so more or less

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,040
and that's something that someone

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,759
changes themselves that's yeah

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,039
and automated yeah that's not that would

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,319
have made it so

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:11,679
we have to let me

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:16,839
go to the code okay

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:19,199
here please by example

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,240
when

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:26,240
if application is

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,240
known it's different to none

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:37,120
i take alti blessings

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:41,120
and check if the status is insective

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:44,160
because if someone recently put the

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:48,240
set the status in

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:51,520
not active active ways i don't

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:55,520
need to count in the active group

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:58,559
india members of the groups no

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,559
so super

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:07,760
she's very very simple we only

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,760
get the data from the fast

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,799
the fast system is very easy

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,600
we need user and pass that is please

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,600
come from

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,600
a configuration file

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:28,799
so i

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:32,080
will be normally translation

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,720
that that from i think is

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,720
come from

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,960
uh

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:47,760
i think this i jason would i

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:50,160
only take the it i treat it like a

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,840
dictionary

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:57,200
uh do some a conversion by example to

00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:02,000
type big time for

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:05,200
a for some for for the lasting

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,360
field uh yeah

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,840
i do some filtering mysteries upsetting

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,840
today

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:19,520
to the data this data is a

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:24,080
panda data frame so we can do a lot

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:27,679
of things about that no by example

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,679
we can do a lot of plots

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:36,720
also we can save it

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,720
for in a

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,760
a comma separated values file

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,720
and another thing is this

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:52,640
making make the class very

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,919
useful because we can use the data frame

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,000
in adult in another

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,000
a code very easily

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:06,640
okay by example

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:10,000
all fedorians is where

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:13,919
i don't succeed in nothing from

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:17,360
from groves or or by country

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,320
i only get out the members of the fedora

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,640
project

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,640
and

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:36,320
so one thing i have a question about

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,600
i think i i think i understand the tool

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,960
better now

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,600
um my question to you which i think will

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,480
help

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,320
us figure out the hack session agenda

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,919
and focus

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,120
if you could have one thing added or

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,559
improved to this

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,960
tool what what would be that thing like

00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:00,320
what would be one thing to make

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,640
um what would be like your

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,919
your dream goal for like one year from

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,919
now with that tool

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:21,520
i will say um

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,520
big question yeah what question

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:32,240
i want to the

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,240
a about the code i think the

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,000
our first or

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:43,280
goal is make it

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,280
compatible with the new freight

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:49,120
implementation

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:53,120
but we have two problems

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:55,600
i we don't have a frapa implementation

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,600
working

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,480
accessible to and so

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,080
this is not the repeat one more time i

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,280
did not catch that

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:11,200
okay we don't have uh the

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:13,600
infrastructure of the free by

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,360
implement new implementation of the

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,880
authentication

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:22,240
ready to use i think at last

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,240
yesterday i heard the

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:29,760
the presentation about it and

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:33,440
will be available

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:36,960
available to

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:40,000
in a month more or less so

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,039
i think the second thing we

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,640
can do is improv or

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:50,240
plots uh we have plots by example

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,240
we are i'll the

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,360
the plots the world maps can i

00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,799
generate comes from nested plot

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:04,320
to worlds too

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:09,919
as it go bloodly and generate

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,919
the skin of or

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,039
of maps this

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:23,360
um i i want to

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:27,520
make it um

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,080
or customizable for the external user of

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,200
the class

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:36,080
by example i have hardcode

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,080
piece that data and layout

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,840
so by example if the people

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,840
like small the

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,520
other tip other type of the automatic by

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,039
simple

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:55,919
um is the name of this

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:55,919
is is this

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:06,720
or want to do some like uh plot only

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:09,919
asia or north america or africa

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:13,600
we can do that with in this case

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:17,120
with this code which now because his

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:20,880
hardcore does part so

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,640
also the color or scheme

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,279
is to the whole world it's

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,320
pre-configured to worldwide

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:32,000
yeah we can change the views

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:35,570
by simple um

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,670
uh we support um

00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,670
[Music]

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:47,520
europe asia africa north america

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:51,120
and south america so maybe for

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:53,840
some kind of plots is better have a

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,840
by example

00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:00,720
a asia

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,679
will be great because we had a lot of

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,760
attribute

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:08,799
contributors in asia and

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:14,320
so we can change

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:18,480
for one of these values the part of the

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,480
of the type and also

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,679
the type of the projection

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:33,440
is called we good

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:38,480
a choice another by example um

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:42,480
mercator i think mergator is a kind of

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,720
of of type of projection

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,720
is

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:51,360
uh so i have a question regarding maps

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:55,120
here alberto

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:57,200
come on so

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,400
which library are you using to generate

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,799
those maps like

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:05,440
is it just a node that is hard coded so

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,559
which one is it like are using have you

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,000
created your own

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:12,480
maps uh library or sort thing or i'll be

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,400
using something else

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:19,760
oh i'll actually i have

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,760
let me go okay

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:28,559
i love the bloody library

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:32,080
for the maps but that's why i have regal

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:36,080
so we can do some

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:39,279
or more methods for

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:42,000
different kinds of of

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,559
libraries for plotting the world the

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,400
maps

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:51,760
but a

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:54,799
uh or maybe a get an interface so

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:58,159
or uses heritage for

00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:01,360
working latino king of maps is

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:04,960
we if we

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:08,960
we want to use some

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:11,679
know f form or plot

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,960
nor data is fine i'm very i would be

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,799
very happy to see

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,799
more kind of maps here

00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:24,159
um

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:27,279
oh also i i

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:30,720
will be fantastic use more uh

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:34,799
jupiter notebooks okay because

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:39,200
hell a lot for working with

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:42,399
data for presentation or

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:46,080
or like documents will be great actually

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:49,760
plot word 2 works with notebooks

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:53,039
works fine but is the only

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:56,080
uh method that's worse

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:59,120
in not boots right now so

00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:02,720
we mostly need

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:06,000
not worry about okay

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,440
got it so i have a cup

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,919
sorry waiting this here did you have a

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,440
question or was that it

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:18,640
okay nope nope so i have

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,640
two ideas from everything i've seen here

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,159
of what we could could do for the next

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,960
few months around the metrics

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:30,480
conversation i think when we talk about

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,279
metrics it'll help us if we can

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,480
come up with some big picture goals now

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,919
because i don't know

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:40,159
we used to do this more in 2015 and 2016

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,559
when we were doing more metrics work

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,720
but it has a long time has passed since

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:48,000
we were focusing on that

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,159
so the two ideas of maybe short-term

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,799
goals that we could do as metrics goals

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:55,279
related to geo fp

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,919
like one thing i think would be cool

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,279
would

00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,320
be to automate one map any it could be

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,520
any map

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:06,240
but what i mean is um automating it so

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:10,080
like once a month or once a week

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,960
at this webs webpage url

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,520
this map gets updated regularly so we

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,840
could say

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,799
for example the ambassador map we could

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,200
use that

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,880
as maybe a way for places we want to

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,919
make sure we get representation

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,440
for in the revamp for example you know

00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,320
i'm just thinking out loud i don't know

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,480
this

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:33,840
but say um we have

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,320
uh you know 60 ambassadors

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,960
who are in bangladesh and most of them

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,600
haven't done anything for a couple years

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,960
but used to be very active once we dig

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,000
into the data

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:49,200
maybe we want to message them and uh

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,960
ask for their help um in in the

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,840
ambassador rework

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,840
um that that would be the goal i think

00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,679
of like maybe one map if we wanted to

00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,720
choose like the ambassador map or the

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,080
advocates map

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:05,440
that could be maybe a small enough goal

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,840
that it wouldn't be too hard to do and i

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,360
see

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:12,559
that same question about the infra

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:15,440
team yeah

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,080
so i'll come back to that in a second

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,919
the second

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:22,320
idea that i had was i know

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,559
in the text chats and on telegram before

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,159
the session we were talking a lot about

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,640
the dni data

00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,159
and ways that we could work with the dni

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,760
team on this

00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:36,880
um i think if we can figure out what

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,440
what is a useful dni map and even if

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,720
that's not

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:43,200
automated that's fine but make a dni map

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,200
based on feedback from

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,320
from the dni team about what would be

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,440
useful

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:52,720
to the map and i feel like those

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,399
two things might be easy enough

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,679
that we could like work towards that

00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,640
over the next few months because i know

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,840
everyone all of us

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:03,600
i think in this there's four of us

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:06,640
all four of us are all volunteers so

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,880
yeah the automation

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,480
piece with the inv yeah the dni stuff is

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,240
not easy that's why i think it wouldn't

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,240
be like a one week thing it'd be

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,399
a couple months of figuring out what

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,519
makes sense and what doesn't

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,720
um the infrastructure question of who uh

00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,399
justin if you would like

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,480
does it i do it sorry

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,840
uh i would like to answer that question

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,000
the intro one

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,600
because so far i would like can you hear

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,600
me now yeah

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,240
so um in the past mind your meetings i

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,159
have

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,279
no we were talking about hosting the

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,640
lime research thing

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:45,519
and uh we i believe

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,399
it was nick bieber who asked that

00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,840
fedora's

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,760
inferior team is having a lot of

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,039
services to maintain and currently

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:56,320
actively developing that so what

00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:59,279
they can arrange is a aws instance

00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,679
which we can provision according to our

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,080
needs and

00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,880
that was for the context of lime survey

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,480
but i'm

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,159
pretty sure if you would request

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,880
something like uh

00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,840
uh aws instance which we would be

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,480
maintaining that would be much easier

00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:19,679
to get our hands on and get started with

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,799
automating that in the pipeline sounds

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,679
great

00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,559
what do you think that makes a lot of

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,080
sense to me

00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:29,200
the one thing i think might be a sticky

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,640
point

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,799
is what data gets saved so i know this

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,080
was what happened to community shift and

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,200
what kind of sunk that

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,279
ship for now

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,960
was that there was personal identifying

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:46,559
data and gdpr

00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,480
became this concern so

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,480
not that that's made it impossible but

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,799
it's made the challenge a lot harder

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,440
about

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,480
what kinds of things can run in fedora

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,919
infrastructure

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,240
so thinking about that this makes me

00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,159
think

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:05,279
is that yeah option one would be

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,840
if we can be sure that no data beyond

00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,399
the

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,760
no personal data no emails no latitude

00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:13,360
longitude

00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:16,880
is saved to a name or an email address

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:19,760
if that info is not stored on the server

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,519
i think it'll be easier for us to work

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:25,919
with the infra team

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:27,360
to do an aws instance or whatever um

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,360
as long as someone is basically the

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,799
concern i think for us is really someone

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,640
to pay the bill

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,320
more so than it is anything else it

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,159
doesn't matter where it is as long as

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,640
it's it's there when we need it um so i

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,399
think that

00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,799
is that approach makes a lot of sense to

00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:44,240
me will probably have to work with the

00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,679
team it might be more work than i

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,399
thought it was going to be

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,760
um i don't know maybe you maybe it makes

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,840
more sense to you

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,360
or maybe we have to think about the data

00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,559
piece a little bit because i don't know

00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,559
if this tool doesn't look like it was

00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,960
really made for automation

00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,880
um like something you'd automate a map

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,919
once a week kind of thing

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,720
um so maybe

00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,079
uh it's a nice idea but given that they

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,679
work locally i'm i'm kind of

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,720
backtracking a little bit like i'm

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,639
thinking maybe

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:15,040
it's a good idea but we come back to it

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:19,200
once we figure out the dni map first

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:22,480
maybe um okay what do you think

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:26,560
just absolutely a comment we can

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:31,679
the map is just a html

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:35,520
file so maybe fedora people

00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:38,879
hosted will be fine for a simple

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:42,320
html file we until we get

00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:49,839
some more a

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:49,839
dedicated because

00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,480
it broke up for me a little bit could

00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:01,680
you say that one more time

00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:05,200
okay i i say the

00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:08,960
the maps are only html files

00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:12,640
so we can hosted it in fedora people

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:16,160
we call no much problem

00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:19,200
they use a hit i get

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:23,040
a implementation backgrounds for

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:26,800
some things like like yeah i don't know

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:30,240
so i like that a lot we can use that for

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:33,119
upload the maps every week

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,320
or a lot of maths because it's become

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,720
very simple because

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,640
it's only a html file

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,160
basically run the script get the map and

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,599
upload it to fedora people

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,560
yeah yeah nice that that i think would

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,200
work i think

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,839
it'd still be some manual work but it's

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,280
doable

00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,880
yeah sorry go ahead in this here i would

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,280
like to add one thing here

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,200
uh basically the concern you raised

00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,119
about the data was still persist in the

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,359
fedora people's thing

00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,200
so i believe that's and that's the thing

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:06,400
that we need to look at

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:09,599
what data we save on the map so

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:12,160
does the html files have identifying

00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,880
info like names or emails in it or is it

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,119
just

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,720
like heat maps basically that's the

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,680
question we have to answer does the map

00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,800
have

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:24,000
like a name or an email address

00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,000
they only use the

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:30,720
um the country codes

00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,440
of the account so we don't have any

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,440
other

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:40,000
data from the users is i think it's

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:43,280
safe use and publish it because

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,119
14 any

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,119
feeling about the privacy

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:56,560
looking at the plotly source now

00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:59,440
and it's like super simple it's

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,119
silly simple javascript code like it's

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,839
just taking the country codes like you

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,520
said

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:08,720
yes account so that would be

00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,880
totally fine to put on fedora

00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,640
well i guess i should say i am not a

00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,320
lawyer and this does not constitute

00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,359
financial or legal advice

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:21,920
but i am vegan

00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:23,440
okay i am pretty sure that fedora people

00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,280
is not going to be a problem

00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:29,359
we'll probably want to maybe um

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,560
mention to the council that we're doing

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:34,000
it just

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,920
to make sure it's uh we're not

00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
stepping on any toes or anything with

00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,280
data but i'm pretty sure we'll be okay

00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,480
to do the

00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:45,680
run it locally where the data is

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,400
take the html file upload that to fedora

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,800
people

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:55,680
that makes sense okay yeah

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:57,680
so oh my my my hop-in chat just crashed

00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,640
so it's telling me i have to refresh the

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:05,839
page

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:05,839
um i guess i'll be i'll be right back

00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:21,200
uh i believe i have it here

00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:28,560
so alberto um

00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,079
i'm currently forking the vapor and

00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,920
gonna clone it in a bit

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:36,960
so i'm gonna clone it now okay uh

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:40,000
that was weird um now i see all of these

00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,240
and this year's messages so

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,240
um

00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,320
so okay so i'm just gonna think out loud

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,640
really quick so we've got

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:55,680
about one hour left for the hack session

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,240
um i'm wondering do we want to talk

00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,680
about

00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,079
the dni maps a little bit first or do we

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,240
want

00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:04,400
to um hack a little like actually do

00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,760
some hacking like we don't have to um

00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:10,240
we want to do some like uh uh

00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,520
live like code editing too we could do

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,359
some of that

00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,920
um oh we're gonna talk about a com blog

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:17,440
post actually that was one thing too

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,720
um so i guess i guess that's the

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,720
question i'm asking is do we want to do

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,359
like a silent breakout for a little bit

00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,599
like i could

00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,200
i could work on a com blog post and then

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,880
we could do some work on the metrics or

00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,000
do we want to talk about the dni data

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,920
first

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:35,280
okay we we can talk about the dnf

00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:38,480
data first yeah yeah

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:41,359
cool a b you want to hop on

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,560
audio if you're around you don't have to

00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:45,119
but it would help

00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,119
if you're there

00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:56,480
[Laughter]

00:39:52,079 --> 00:40:00,160
so hello b hello i'm just

00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:03,359
trying to sleep in my bed

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,480
and yeah do the meeting so i'm going to

00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:09,359
turn off my video

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,359
but yes i'll be here okay

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,520
so i guess the the open question is

00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,240
um actually alberto on your screen could

00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,880
you put

00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,880
the um the dni map you have so far

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,400
i guess the questions we can start

00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,400
asking is what would be

00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,520
what would be useful for the dni team in

00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,640
terms of

00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,480
what data is available and where we want

00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:37,280
to start with that

00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,280
um i just have one quick question for

00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:43,040
alberto before that

00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:46,800
how long does the gofp test script

00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:53,839
take to run alberto it just says go for

00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:53,839
a coffee

00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:02,880
[Music]

00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:06,400
i have a low internet connection

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:09,680
so look like

00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,160
take hours for me put actually and my

00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,359
world

00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:16,880
uh now in my home in my home is

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:20,960
pretty fast i think maybe

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:24,400
three minutes if three minutes

00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:28,319
three minutes maybe it's

00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:31,920
stuck i don't know i think i'll

00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,960
let me we definitely need some logging

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,079
here

00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:38,800
uh some practicing so uh

00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,599
i don't think you need a fast login for

00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,440
the basic

00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,200
stuff like unless you are fetching a

00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,640
group info you don't need it

00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,680
just for the activity i'm just doing the

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,760
one without the

00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:55,040
login me oh can you not hear

00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,440
b i was thinking about logging

00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,240
i was thinking about logging l o double

00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,599
t i n

00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:08,319
okay sorry

00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:11,359
ah yes we don't have any logging here

00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,359
i think now

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
so what did we decide from the three

00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,680
options with justin presented

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,440
so i think we're talking a little bit

00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,680
about the dni data

00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,920
and this is the map that alberto just

00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,920
pulled up on the screen

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,760
so this is i guess our this is our our

00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,480
team um

00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,800
based on whether one thing that's always

00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,480
the caveat in this data i always have to

00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,720
remember is it depends on you

00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,079
actually manually entering your latitude

00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,599
and longitude

00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:48,800
into fast which is totally not obvious

00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:52,160
um i think right or is it time zone

00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,880
is that wrong it's time zone

00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,720
and country as far as i know for this

00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,599
one is only the

00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,160
the country and you set in your first

00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,520
account

00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:06,880
so she's very okay

00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:10,160
if you move from i don't know from

00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:13,280
india to uk

00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:15,760
maybe you actually looks like in

00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,119
india not in uk because you need to

00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,319
change manually your

00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,560
fast account to point to the new country

00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,560
so

00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,920
there's some risk of it being outdated

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,440
but it is better than latitude longitude

00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,400
that's that's good to know i'm glad i

00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,599
asked

00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:36,000
yeah so i guess

00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,640
maybe the question i'm going to ask b is

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,280
um

00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,280
if it makes sense for us to look at our

00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,240
team or if we want to look

00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,800
more broadly at like a specific fast

00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,119
group

00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,160
that might be of interest to the dni

00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:54,319
team

00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:57,599
um that's what i'm trying to think about

00:43:54,319 --> 00:44:02,160
i think like we can start a bit

00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:05,440
small at least in the beginning

00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,440
and and i think it's more like better to

00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,000
have like a defined like two three

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,800
different

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,400
questions and just look at them first

00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,040
rather than

00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:17,200
thinking like how do we like rather than

00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,440
making a road map and saying yes we want

00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,839
to target this area or that area

00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,720
so just like specifically define what

00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:28,720
exactly we want to see

00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:30,880
and then we can scale that upwards

00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,880
right

00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,520
thinking out loud just that makes me

00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,000
think like it'd be super interesting

00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,480
just to get

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,440
a map of our fedora women's day

00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,720
organizers

00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,760
or even events um that's interesting

00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,480
just because then we could know like

00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,359
where do we have

00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,200
active local communities and then we

00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:50,400
could ask like oh well every year

00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,160
there's a

00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,079
a community in lima that does fedora

00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,680
women's day for the last three years

00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,520
and are they doing other things in the

00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,440
project or maybe we could try to bring

00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,119
them in in other ways or

00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,240
nominate someone for mindshare from

00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,599
there because wow there's a lot of

00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:07,359
people from there

00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,359
like you know just ideas

00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:19,839
so fedora woman's day

00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,839
sunscreen i think we

00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,960
we oh change my

00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:32,079
mind oh

00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:34,319
if we have a list of all the

00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,520
your guinness heroes of the federal

00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:39,760
government's day

00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:41,440
maybe we can plot something similar for

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,680
this

00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,680
uh

00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,960
uh a question about fedor women's day is

00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,640
how are we gonna know that fedora

00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,440
women's day was organized in that

00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,720
specific

00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,440
country or location because we won't be

00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,640
having that

00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,720
information in fast or

00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,040
there would be figure tickets but we are

00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:09,200
not sure that those period tickets were

00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,200
completed or we have had those sessions

00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,599
i might be able to answer that it's not

00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:19,599
a great answer but it's a better answer

00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:22,960
um yesterday nikhil

00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:26,000
on our team emailed me

00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:29,200
the fwd29 feedback form

00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,560
where if i remember right we did

00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:34,400
ask for fast id but i think i remember

00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,760
like there were there were 90 responses

00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,800
to that survey i think

00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,400
10 fast ids which were usually the

00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,680
organizers

00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:46,000
um maybe we could have a manual like a

00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,839
maybe a config file for now like if we

00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,720
want to think about how to make this

00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:51,520
work

00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,400
you could maybe put fast id user names

00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,960
as like

00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,839
special group or local group and

00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,359
manually list fast ids in a config file

00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:03,119
list or something

00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:06,160
and then use that um

00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:08,000
um where was my screen oh to

00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,520
look at like that would be our answer

00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,079
how do we get the fedora women's day

00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,720
data

00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,839
like we have to manually collect who our

00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,079
organizers are

00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,960
but say we get a list of 10 fast user

00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,200
names

00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,599
where we're saying like hey here are 10

00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:25,040
federal women day organizers

00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,400
um and then map go from there once we

00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,280
have fast ids

00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,680
what do you think that sounds like a

00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,680
background

00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:40,240
alberto i can hear some background voice

00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,240
at your side

00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:48,160
uh that sounds great justin like we can

00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,640
get those path ids from the feedback

00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,240
form

00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:54,720
and run that to a geofp and

00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,720
get those

00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:04,480
maybe the more ac thing is

00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:07,520
uh collecting country codes for

00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:10,160
all the federal women's day and was

00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:13,839
organizated and we can

00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:17,520
we could use uh fast icons

00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:18,839
this will be very easy change some cup

00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:22,640
to blood

00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:25,920
this this map

00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,920
only with the country

00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,280
of the of the organizers yeah

00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,559
i like that i like that idea and

00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,440
building on that is like a

00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:40,880
future thing so if maybe we want to

00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,839
start

00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,680
with mapping local i'm typing in the

00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:47,839
either pad notes by the way let me put

00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:51,280
that link back in the

00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:55,760
chat so folks can find it um so we could

00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:59,040
start by mapping local fwd

00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:02,079
organizers and understand

00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:04,800
where they are after

00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:06,000
we could probably build on that and look

00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,680
at

00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:13,839
entire countries um

00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,839
where fwd events happen

00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,760
and then we could maybe try to dig some

00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:18,480
insight of like well let's look at

00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,040
october

00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:23,200
of every year in chile because there's

00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,160
two fedora women's days in chile in

00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,000
october

00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,920
and maybe we'll see like oh here's a

00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,440
spike in new contributor registrations

00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,520
or new fed message like

00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,880
we can start to ask deeper questions

00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,640
later um

00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,640
but i like that i like the idea of

00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,680
starting with just mapping the local

00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,440
organizers

00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,800
even if it's just like five accounts

00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,800
because

00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,800
we can build on it we can we can keep

00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,720
iterating so

00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,520
i i love this idea i think that the

00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,520
challenge to me sounds like

00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,440
white list or no not white that's

00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:56,880
probably not the right word anyways but

00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:58,720
um starting with a custom list of like

00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:02,319
five or six accounts

00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:04,880
and making a method for a manually

00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:07,520
shared list of fast ids

00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,520
what do you think

00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:19,599
i think i'm not sure of having

00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,599
a list of fast ids like

00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:27,040
i mean i know that we did like a badge

00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:29,359
before for federal women's day so maybe

00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:32,000
something

00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,000
like that

00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,559
so they can just that is actually get

00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:40,079
the badge

00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:42,319
and but i know

00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,200
also know that like one of the problems

00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:46,079
with the badge

00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:48,319
was like the organizers like forgot to

00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,520
avoid it or like they didn't get awarded

00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:52,720
somehow

00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,400
so they just got awarded in like one of

00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,480
the

00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:57,599
fwds in tirana but like other organizers

00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,520
didn't

00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:01,520
so i'm not sure if it was because the

00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,359
badge was late or if they faced any

00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:06,240
issues so maybe we also need to talk to

00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:08,480
organizers first if they think this

00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:11,920
badge idea is feasible

00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,200
or not the one thing that's really cool

00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,240
about the badge data

00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,440
is we can also group it into years which

00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,559
is something we can

00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:23,040
just link the fwd 17 badge which was

00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:24,880
claimed by 32 people

00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,960
um and then we only have two badges

00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,920
actually there we didn't do one in 2019

00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,440
i guess

00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,720
um the 2018 one was claimed 15 times

00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,599
which that was the one yeah looks like

00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:37,280
was really just rochester

00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,720
the but we do have all the organizers

00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,599
there actually i do see all of the

00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,160
organizers

00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:43,839
people who proposed events yeah um in

00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,760
the 2018 i don't know

00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:48,960
probably a couple of these are attendees

00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,960
but yeah

00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,520
so if they didn't create a fast account

00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:59,760
at even

00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,720
the event but like had one after maybe

00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,079
we need to

00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:05,359
do something like some form later where

00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:08,880
they can also

00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:11,520
put their like get the badge or just

00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:15,040
some feedback form after event where

00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,040
they have time to create the class

00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,200
that's a great point because as we're

00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,280
getting ready to talk about fedora

00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:23,760
women's day planning tomorrow

00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,480
we can make sure that we we think about

00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,440
these things

00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,480
when uh working with our our local

00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,880
organizers so

00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,400
that that's a really great point is it's

00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,920
not just going to be a data piece here

00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,440
right because we're starting you know

00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,520
the data piece might be starting with

00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:40,000
our manual list of organizers but yeah

00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:42,800
we should think a little harder about

00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,920
ways to collect better data or data that

00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,680
will help us

00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,319
avoid pitfalls um i like the idea of

00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,720
badges

00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:52,559
and yeah sorry go ahead yeah i think

00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,400
there was also this discussion about

00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,720
what platform we will use

00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,880
to conduct the virtual fedora women's

00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,359
day so if you're doing something

00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,119
like just the hop-in platform for fedora

00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:05,200
women's day again

00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,800
so then i think it it will just be

00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,559
easier to collect the speed

00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,079
like the feedback forms and the data

00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:13,280
right and we can also do polls

00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:18,079
in there so even after the

00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:18,079
event is over we can get some more data

00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:28,160
that makes sense so

00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:30,240
i i think i need to do

00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,520
and it break um i don't know if we want

00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,960
to pause for a moment or if you all want

00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,720
to keep going but i'm gonna

00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,000
i'm gonna jump off just for five minutes

00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:39,839
just to

00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,040
refresh um i i think when we come

00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:43,200
maybe if we want i don't know if we to

00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,800
break or not but i was just thinking um

00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,720
the thing that might be helpful to drive

00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:49,280
towards for the last little bit

00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:50,640
is what our next steps will be over the

00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,240
next month or two because i think we've

00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,359
got some good ideas that we talked about

00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,040
this last hour

00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:57,040
so i think we can talk about how to make

00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,960
it happen but

00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,559
anyways i'm gonna jump off for a little

00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:04,960
bit i will be back at

00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,960
10 after so in like seven ish minutes

00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,440
okay

00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,599
i am gonna jump off for two minutes as

00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:17,040
well i'm gonna fetch something

00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:21,520
or something to eat so

00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:21,520
i'll be here but i will be away

00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:28,319
okay

00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:32,160
hey alberto hey yona

00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:36,240
are you here or are you

00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:39,839
thank you okay

00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,839
how are you doing these days

00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:50,000
i was actually running the so

00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,799
i was running your scripts on my

00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,119
computer

00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:54,559
right now but i think data gripper is a

00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:57,520
bit slow

00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:58,799
so it's taking some time to collect the

00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,880
data

00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:03,760
but yeah i will just see how long it

00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:06,240
takes and the other thing is that like

00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,440
i don't have like the plugins installed

00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,799
so i cannot

00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,839
uh use the fast api to fetch as well but

00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:14,079
yes

00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:18,079
i will try and hopefully i can support

00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:18,079
you with some like jupiter notebooks

00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:21,260
[Music]

00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:30,480
do you know if it's possible to do um

00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:33,280
[Music]

00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,960
i mean i think you need a fedora desktop

00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:39,520
always right to do it

00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,520
like to have the fast client

00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:50,640
can you do it on another os

00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,640
alberto

00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:02,000
maybe he's not here yeah i think that

00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:03,680
he also went away bruce's connection was

00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,799
taking for a while

00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,799
i can ask him later

00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:14,079
why am i what about you how are you

00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,079
doing

00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:21,040
hello fine justin pragma

00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:23,680
waiting for you to come and visit

00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,680
oh really

00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,000
yeah we were just discussing like what

00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:32,640
um dni metrics we want

00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,920
to collect and one idea was that we can

00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:37,040
try to plot all the

00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:40,400
fedora women's day like uh

00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:43,440
on the global match and then

00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,000
once we have this plot like after some

00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,319
months

00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,119
after the event we can try to see the

00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:49,040
activities

00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:51,599
in this region so in this country is

00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,640
basically if it jumps or like what

00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,799
happened

00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:58,400
based on so to basically count the

00:56:54,799 --> 00:57:00,720
impact of the event it's

00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,799
actually that's a good point because uh

00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:06,319
it was a point that we ate it on the

00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:09,680
agenda for fedora women's day

00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:11,599
that uh because it was like we had some

00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,480
metrics that we were gathering after the

00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:15,920
event

00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:18,000
but making like sure that we had exact

00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,960
matrix because as we said the badge for

00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,040
example

00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:23,839
they either forgot to award it or

00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,240
sometime

00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:27,359
they said that for example people didn't

00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,599
have

00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:31,040
their fuss account and sometimes for

00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,440
example they didn't have

00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,160
internet at the location so they had to

00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,960
create one

00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,640
later but they didn't have a contact of

00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,920
them so

00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:43,839
yeah like making sure that we don't keep

00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,559
this or how to make sure that all the

00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:49,359
attendants will have it and so on

00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:51,760
so do you know do you have an idea if we

00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:55,040
will use the same hop-in platform again

00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,880
or like will every organizer okay so if

00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,799
we use this platform i think it will be

00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,960
easier to collect this data

00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:02,319
because yeah everybody will be online

00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:05,520
and like

00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:08,319
logging in right yeah uh

00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:10,559
last time that i spoke with marie we

00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:13,200
thought to use this platform

00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,680
but i will catch up later with her after

00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,640
vlog

00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:19,119
because now she was doing with loch

00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:22,079
ness with fedora so

00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:23,920
but i believe we will use this one yeah

00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,079
because i think the problems we faced

00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,799
with like offline events of not having

00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:29,839
internet

00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:32,400
and also like oblique data collection

00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:34,000
that will be reduced if we have like a

00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,480
uniform platform and we

00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,559
will have it in one place also i think

00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:41,119
buddy might attend our session tomorrow

00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:41,119
i'm not sure

00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,559
we can ask her then but i i really

00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:51,839
believe that we will use this platform

00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:51,839
and um

00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,640
but we can stay

00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:10,559
yeah i mean even if we have their email

00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,839
address

00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:14,559
we can like send them a link to get the

00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:18,319
badge

00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:20,559
or like and then um or like uh the

00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:21,920
organizer can avoid the badge if they

00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:24,000
just create an

00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,760
uh account right so we can send them an

00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,079
email on the email address

00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,359
like if you fill this feedback survey we

00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:33,839
can avoid you a badge

00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:33,839
or something like that

00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:41,680
but i think it will be way better this

00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,079
time because

00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:46,799
yeah it will be online and we will have

00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:48,720
their data

00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:52,000
also i was thinking we could click

00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:55,040
create some fun pause or let give some

00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,440
examples of fun calls to organizers and

00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,319
that

00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:00,400
like we are doing right now in nest and

00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:02,240
that will be even like more fun for that

01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,559
and these as well instead of just you

01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,200
know

01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:05,200
the session

01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:14,380
so what exactly you mean

01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:16,240
so like um we have this ball

01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:18,799
[Music]

01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:20,079
right now so we can do some falls like

01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:22,960
that for the

01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:25,400
fedora women's day attendees as well and

01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:28,319
we will have some more

01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:31,119
data definitely uh

01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:32,319
we can prepare some questions beforehand

01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:36,880
and

01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:38,640
we can have it there okay

01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:41,119
i think there are many things that we

01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:43,440
can do with the platform so

01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:45,359
so we will have i think a lot more data

01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:48,000
at least for fedora women's day

01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:48,000
than before

01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,480
we should just think when we get back to

01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:54,480
in person

01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:56,000
how we will do it but i guess with uh

01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:59,280
online monitors

01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,480
but i think even with in person if we

01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,720
have just like

01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:04,640
it because we didn't do any event

01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:07,760
registration sort of thing

01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,640
before if we do like eventbrite or some

01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,960
platform for

01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:12,079
like event registration and like sell

01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,839
free tickets

01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:15,680
so we can collect you know just the

01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:18,160
email addresses and that that way we can

01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:21,359
get feedback

01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:24,880
yeah it was only that we

01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:28,240
left this part up to the

01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,799
local organization yeah but i think we

01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:32,319
also

01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:34,640
learn over time yeah

01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:36,839
but we can definitely like suggest a

01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:39,839
platform to them and they can create

01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:39,839
videos

01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:43,469
[Music]

01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,880
but we have time at least until next

01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,880
year

01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:55,280
uh excuse me people that i'm eating

01:01:56,100 --> 01:02:00,799
[Music]

01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:02,720
i eaten most of my meetings with yonah

01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:07,839
yeah i was just about to say i'm

01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:07,839
surprised that me is not eating

01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:15,680
no i was i'm done with it i ate a lot

01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:17,119
did you bake the cake no i was not

01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:19,520
baking a cake i was making

01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:20,880
like trying to make an indian dessert

01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:24,000
basically

01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:26,240
but i think i underestimated

01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,319
how much i want to eat that

01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:31,839
[Music]

01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:35,599
what i want

01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:38,079
i want to eat that

01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:38,079
we do

01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:45,680
have that i want to eat that but it's

01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:48,960
not yet

01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:50,720
finished or what happened because uh

01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,400
this that session was just before this

01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:56,640
right so i just left it midway

01:02:52,400 --> 01:03:01,039
for this session oh okay

01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:05,119
oh yep

01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:06,880
yeah i mean it's basically like it takes

01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:10,400
a lot of time to cook

01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,400
i think yeah

01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:19,920
so are you showing the data alberto

01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:19,920
what are you

01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,319
i'm getting some sort of error

01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:34,240
with requests

01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:37,359
i think we have

01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:39,359
fedora here but

01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:41,200
when i'm when i'm trying to install the

01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:45,039
fedora package from pip

01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:47,680
uh it's resulting in some errors

01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:49,440
which os do you have you have are you

01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:54,000
working on fedora

01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:54,000
or no yep

01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:00,640
just why don't you clone it from the

01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:02,799
gate repo

01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,799
and

01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:11,119
uh what

01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:14,559
uh the pattern package uh

01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:18,000
i thought you had some issues with the

01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:21,920
fast package right

01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:26,480
yep so just clone it from the gate repo

01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:29,920
instead of doing this i mean

01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:32,480
so where does that rapport live

01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,480
i think

01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:43,680
it's in fedora and craft crash i will

01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,680
send you along

01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:47,920
that's really helpful

01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:55,839
uh justin's back hello justin

01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:09,839
so alberto is doing some changes which

01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:09,839
i think looks awesome

01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:23,839
is the same data with another projection

01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:23,839
i use oh

01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:33,200
with the bridge and so

01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:37,839
it looks fine it's beautiful

01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:37,839
i think um

01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:51,520
i think yes

01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:55,440
probably for our team

01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:58,720
or maybe lewis no i'm not sure

01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:02,160
luis also is actually employed

01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:06,799
but he's leaving

01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:06,799
chile right now i think

01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:19,839
oh

01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:31,359
[Music]

01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:32,559
do we want to pick back up on the

01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:36,240
discussion

01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:37,599
about the next couple weeks or months

01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:41,119
for

01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:41,119
gofp metrics work

01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,520
so we are done with the dni discussion

01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,880
all right

01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:49,760
nothing done with it but just figuring

01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:53,039
out what what the action items are

01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:53,039
to start making it happen

01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:58,960
so let's finish that section first

01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:04,559
and then we can talk about action items

01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:08,319
for g o f p one

01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:12,079
right um

01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:16,160
about the f f w d and

01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:18,960
and j right yeah so let's finish the

01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,960
fwd

01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:28,319
so what i'm thinking is

01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:30,319
so for mapping out next steps for the

01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:32,640
dni maps

01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:32,640
um

01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:42,240
we're going to want to collect a list

01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:45,039
of fast user names of people

01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:46,720
who once organized who ever organized

01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:49,839
organized in the last year

01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:50,640
do we want to do we want to put whoever

01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:53,520
organized

01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:54,400
is good like we can have that by the

01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:57,200
tickets right

01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:59,680
like the time and the year and the

01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,680
location

01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:04,720
so we'll start with anyone who ever

01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,720
organized

01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:09,520
oh them yes and now you're eating point

01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:17,140
i am i've got uh nuts and chocolate and

01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,440
raisins and walnuts

01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:20,799
[Music]

01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:24,400
that's making it's gonna make me miss

01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:27,359
the candy swap even more about flock

01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,359
there's all the indian food

01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:41,359
i've got nimble

01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:44,239
so i see someone's working on

01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:44,239
yeah it's me

01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:53,839
okay i thought justin had two usernames

01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,719
so i think we're looking at the the

01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:04,839
either pad as well

01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:07,839
i'll drop the link in there one more

01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:07,839
time

01:09:22,279 --> 01:09:25,379
[Applause]

01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:38,400
so

01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:39,440
so collecting the net collecting the

01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:41,679
usernames

01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:42,560
collaborating with the dni team on the

01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:46,000
gofp

01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:49,920
side i think we're going to need a way

01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:51,359
to just to create um another section

01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:56,000
please forgive

01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:58,080
and not that don't put it in the dni map

01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,679
but i mean isn't it isn't the geo fp

01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,840
part of the dni map since we're using

01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:03,840
geo fp

01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:03,840
to

01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:08,719
but it's also for broader use right okay

01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:11,199
cool

01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:12,960
yep true yeah but i guess the the

01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:14,159
conversation is how can we make this

01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,239
tool more useful

01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:18,080
to the dni team as kind of like a use

01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:20,239
case a more practical use case

01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,920
okay because i think the challenge is

01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:23,199
like we've had this tool and it's really

01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,719
cool and there's definitely a lot of

01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:26,239
great things we can do with it but how

01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:29,679
do we do those great things

01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:31,920
but i think alberto also

01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:34,400
wanted like a few other things with the

01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:37,840
geosp which are not related to the

01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:39,520
dna map like updating the plots like the

01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,120
argument stuff like more technical

01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:43,840
things

01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:46,000
so yeah there's some of that i think in

01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:47,199
the either pad under that goals future

01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,719
dreams section

01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:50,239
the only thing i'd want to put under the

01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:53,280
dni map which

01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:56,840
i i gotta look at alberto on this one

01:10:53,280 --> 01:11:00,239
um is there an easy way to

01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:01,840
process um a list of users or does that

01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:04,400
to that new functionality does that have

01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,400
to be written

01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:12,400
in boy in gofp

01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:15,679
like say if we give gofp six usernames

01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:15,679
can it map six users

01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:22,000
um well i just realized he's not in the

01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,080
video share

01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,320
he is no i mean i think there is that

01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:30,239
functionality there is this thing called

01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:33,600
by group function i think you give it

01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:35,840
or you give it the group name

01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:37,679
yeah it's probably a fast group we don't

01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,880
have a fast group for footer or women's

01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:43,600
day

01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:43,600
but i didn't how about having one yeah

01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:47,360
we could make one feather i just wonder

01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:50,880
is it

01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:54,159
better sorry go ahead albert

01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,560
yes is the fedora fast growth by the by

01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:57,040
group

01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,040
function

01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:03,840
i need to do better comments one thing i

01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:05,679
don't like about new fast groups

01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:07,440
is when you make a new fast group

01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:08,000
someone also has to maintain the fast

01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,679
group which

01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,239
traditionally we're not very good at in

01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:14,400
fedora so

01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:15,920
that's one thing i'm cautious about is

01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,600
do we want to make a fast group does

01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:19,280
that actually make it easier

01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:23,120
or is it easier if we just have a list

01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:26,640
of users and do it that way

01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:30,000
what makes more sense more in c

01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:33,120
is generate a fast group because

01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,760
i don't we don't need don't need another

01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:38,719
thing

01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:38,719
but i think we can use the

01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:47,440
make a function and take a list of

01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:51,120
files user um do the same is

01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:54,560
we it will be very easy to implement

01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:57,679
and give it and get you

01:12:54,560 --> 01:13:01,840
get used to a better

01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:05,199
functionality and more more phone for

01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:07,920
another a

01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:07,920
data source

01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:13,360
i think also like that functionality is

01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:15,600
sort of like

01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:17,360
written by alberto already you just need

01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,159
to break it into another smaller

01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:20,719
function

01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:20,719
perhaps

01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:28,000
it seems it looked like to me in the

01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:28,000
code too so that's cool

01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:35,280
okay so bringing it back to our steps so

01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:38,239
we're going to

01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:39,120
collect the list of fast user names work

01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:42,560
with the dni

01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:44,320
team for the fwd 2020 which is probably

01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:47,360
going to be a con

01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:51,040
oh about badges and how we do that

01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:52,640
um the geo fp side is just making sure

01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:54,960
that we can take a list

01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:57,360
of fast user names so that way once we

01:13:54,960 --> 01:14:01,199
know who our local organizers are

01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:05,040
we can map them and i feel

01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:08,159
like that's going to be a lot

01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:09,679
for the next few months that and i think

01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:11,440
that would be enough for like once we do

01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:12,320
those things then we could check in and

01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,320
be like

01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:15,520
then figure out what makes sense to do

01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:20,320
next

01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:20,320
um what do you all think yep

01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:27,120
i thought we were also measuring about

01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:30,320
the attendees right so maybe we can

01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:32,480
measure something like

01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:34,880
to do more with the attendees the

01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:36,400
challenge that we had before

01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:38,320
just realized when i looked i was super

01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:40,080
excited because nikhil sent me that

01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:41,440
spreadsheet and then i opened it and i

01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,000
realized that where there were 93

01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:44,000
responses

01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,080
and i had five fast usernames so fast

01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,120
usernames are not

01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:51,840
always a great metric

01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:52,960
for attendees because not everyone

01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,480
registers an account

01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:55,920
and sometimes they even do it like i

01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:58,480
remember i've seen people who are like i

01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:00,080
went to a fedora women's day a year ago

01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:01,679
and then i signed up a year later

01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:03,360
because i had i decided i was going to

01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:06,000
do something in fedora

01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:07,679
um so fast is just a tricky thing with

01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,320
events but i guess that's what we'd talk

01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:11,840
about

01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,840
bobby tomorrow

01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:16,989
[Music]

01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,470
[Music]

01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:27,679
and i were discussing this before uh

01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:30,960
when you were all on break

01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:33,120
and we were like since problem since

01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:35,760
most probably will use the hoppin

01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:36,480
platform this year maybe we can just

01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:39,040
send an

01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:40,719
email afterwards to all the attendees

01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,960
and say like

01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:44,960
uh you can get this badge since you have

01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:46,880
already attended and people might sign

01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:49,520
up if they get an email like that

01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:51,360
yeah but i agree with your point nothing

01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:53,840
to do with the global level

01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,840
i agree

01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:04,480
but can we also i'm out of nepal now

01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:06,719
go ahead jonah i was saying that

01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:08,000
maybe we can add also another way to get

01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:10,719
some data not only

01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,400
from the files like for example we will

01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:13,760
have the exact number of the people that

01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,840
will be attending

01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:17,280
uh because we can see how many people

01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:20,320
will be live

01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:23,760
and we can also see

01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:27,120
from which city will be

01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:29,840
joining i mean it depends uh

01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:31,040
which federal women the local one they

01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:33,840
will participate

01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:34,400
and things like that so maybe like this

01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:38,320
here

01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:42,320
it will be a bit easier in this part

01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:43,840
yeah we can do pause in the hop-in thing

01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:46,840
yeah and we can collect data in

01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:49,840
real-time instead of waiting for

01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:49,840
after

01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:53,440
has changed my my thought about

01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:55,920
collecting feedback

01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:56,480
and how to do surveys i've loved some of

01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:58,800
these uh

01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:59,840
these polls that have come up and so

01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,679
easy there's a

01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:03,120
huge convenience bias but at the same

01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:05,120
time it's still

01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:06,719
a convenience bias of people who are

01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:09,280
very

01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:09,280
fedora

01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:17,840
so i'm all for it at least to start

01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:28,719
so i believe we have a lot of things

01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:31,840
to work on for the next month or so

01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:35,679
months also so i believe like

01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:40,960
we can focus more on how are we gonna

01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:40,960
do that for some time if we have to

01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:50,239
my first thought is we should try to

01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:53,440
put a name on each of those next steps

01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:56,880
in the ether pad um

01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:58,080
so collecting a list of fast user names

01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:00,239
well the second one that's something

01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:03,760
that'll probably happen post

01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:07,760
uh fwd planning

01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:08,960
session um i think the dni team because

01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:11,199
me and b and yonah

01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:13,280
and and this year actually all of us are

01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:16,719
technically i think on the dni team so

01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:18,080
okay uh so we i don't think we have to

01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:19,360
worry too much about how that

01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:22,320
collaboration will look

01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:24,480
given that we're all um pretty tapped in

01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,480
there

01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:32,640
so my thought is i could work

01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:35,040
with the dni team i could lead the work

01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,600
on collecting fast user names of folks

01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:39,360
who have

01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:41,520
organized in the past um

01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:42,960
and then that's just something i could

01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:44,800
do i could get that into a spreadsheet

01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:48,880
or whatever makes sense

01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:51,760
and i guess probably the gofp work would

01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:55,199
probably make sense for alberto to do

01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:56,159
um since he's most hands-on with that

01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:57,360
right now

01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:59,600
one thing i think would also be

01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:00,159
interesting to experiment with while we

01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,400
do this

01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:04,159
is trying to bring new contributors to

01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:07,679
gofp

01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:10,400
um so i'd love i also love maybe not

01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:10,880
right now but maybe in future meetings

01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,280
and come

01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:14,320
ups or or or planning discussions for

01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:17,679
this

01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:19,520
um we can talk more about

01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:20,800
small improvements and things that would

01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:24,719
be like good first

01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:24,719
issues for gofp

01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:29,360
right

01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:32,400
[Music]

01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:34,840
oops upper toe comes in and comes out

01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:37,840
sometimes i don't

01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:37,840
know

01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:45,760
yeah i can see a screen share too i just

01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,440
i think i i think the screen share is

01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:49,280
separate from his audio and video i

01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:52,080
think it's just his screen

01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:52,080
which is kind of weird

01:19:54,320 --> 01:20:00,880
so that's actually a nice idea that

01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:03,199
we want people to get to get started

01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:06,639
with gfp

01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:07,840
currently don't have any uh or let me

01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:10,960
first ensure that

01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:12,960
what i'm saying is right so i'm not sure

01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:18,800
if we have any good first issues here

01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:22,400
we have uh like uh

01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:22,400
yeah no i don't know do we

01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:26,960
that sounds true

01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:33,880
so we have some issues there like create

01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:36,800
wrappers for free ipa migration

01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:40,000
documentation make all the time

01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:41,760
get fantastic columns or remove a

01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:47,840
depreciated method

01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:47,840
create a jupyter

01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:56,320
oh maybe a better use of

01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:57,440
my time if somebody else could pick up

01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:00,719
the task

01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:04,480
of collecting fast usernames of

01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:07,679
fwd organizers i can take an

01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:10,719
action to set up a tiger board

01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:14,000
on teams.fedoraproject.org

01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:16,719
um to try to organize some of our

01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,520
our approach on this like good first

01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:20,239
issues

01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:21,199
and and that side does would that be

01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:22,719
helpful like that's

01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:24,480
that's using more of my skills on

01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:26,320
project management so it's like that

01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,120
work isn't boring i enjoy doing that

01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,560
work

01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:30,560
but i just want to make sure it's useful

01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:34,400
to someone else beyond

01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:37,600
me but i feel like we will have to keep

01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:41,360
managing the diagram

01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:44,400
yeah yeah that's something that i can

01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:46,320
i can help do that's something i

01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:48,080
on the comm up side i can i can take

01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:49,600
that task of just keeping the board up

01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:50,719
to date as long as everyone other people

01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,639
are helping me use it

01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:54,719
and actually putting stuff there that's

01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:57,760
fine but i can help with the

01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:59,040
the day-to-day triage and looking at it

01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:02,719
once again uh so

01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:05,040
with the collection of data from the

01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:07,679
past fwd organizer

01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:08,239
uh uh for now i can take that action

01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:11,440
item

01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:15,199
and take care of it in the next

01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:18,000
week or in the next days

01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:18,000
what do you think

01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:22,800
probably for timeline on on getting the

01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:24,239
list of usernames you can probably sync

01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,080
up with alberto on that

01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:27,760
because basically the list of usernames

01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:31,840
is going to be used in

01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:34,080
the gofp tool for um

01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,080
uh

01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:39,840
my brain just like crashed

01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:48,960
yeah i just like uh it's it's been it's

01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:53,840
been a long

01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:53,840
past few days um

01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:58,400
oh someone else can someone else can

01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:01,120
talk i totally

01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:01,120
totally lost it

01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:10,480
so i think then like alberto

01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:11,840
said he will work on like updating the

01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:14,880
gofp class

01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:16,960
so that and nasser

01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:18,960
will work on collecting the list of

01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:20,159
usernames so you both can coordinate

01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:25,120
together

01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:29,440
and then maybe uh just to make the plot

01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:32,320
i think i'm not sure

01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:34,239
uh i think once you have the list of

01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,840
usernames you can create a ticket or

01:23:34,239 --> 01:23:37,920
just update in the ticket

01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:41,280
and then anybody who has time then they

01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:41,280
can take up that action item

01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:47,440
to create the final gosp plot of the

01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:50,159
organizer

01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:50,159
what do you think

01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:54,400
wait was that com ops ticket or do you

01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:57,199
want to use the gofp

01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:57,199
issue tracker

01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:02,159
[Music]

01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:03,120
we can do the g-o-s-p issue tracker to

01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:05,920
get more uh

01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:07,679
i guess i guess the distinguishment is

01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:09,040
the fedora comm ops one there's a lot

01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:12,159
more people who are

01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:15,440
get emailed and get updates on that one

01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:16,639
gofp probably has much um it's probably

01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:18,000
something like us it's going to be core

01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:19,520
contributors people who are really

01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,239
working on it if we use the issue

01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:22,800
tracker there

01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:24,320
so we can go under the first issue we

01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:27,679
can do a good first issue

01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:30,000
in commod just open it because

01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:32,000
just taking that list and running it

01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,760
right

01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,840
yep and we can see if somebody wants to

01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:37,920
do it

01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:41,600
cool i'll open a ticket placeholder

01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:46,000
right now so we don't lose track of it

01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:49,120
okay so then i think we have

01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:51,840
we have everybody a lot like all the

01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:53,040
action items have been given to someone

01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:55,520
and

01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:56,719
one about the dni data i think we can

01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:59,280
discuss that

01:24:56,719 --> 01:25:01,199
so we have the data like basically what

01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:03,199
exactly we want to plot i don't think we

01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:05,760
can do that right now

01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:06,320
so maybe we can open another ticket for

01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:09,120
that one

01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:11,199
in comox just to keep it there and then

01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:14,480
once we have the data we can update on

01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:14,480
it what we want to do

01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:22,480
justin will you open this ticket as well

01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:25,840
or do you want me to open it if you can

01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:28,560
okay that would be super i'm opening one

01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:29,040
to collect usernames of fwd organizers

01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:33,840
for

01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:33,840
gofp script that's the issue i'm opening

01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:43,120
so with action items

01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:46,000
yeah and i think apart from this

01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:48,000
do we also want to discuss like what

01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,280
things we want to put in the com blog

01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,760
post

01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:52,480
like i thought in the beginning we said

01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:56,000
we were

01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:56,000
no yeah we did what

01:25:56,239 --> 01:26:01,600
okay so in the beginning for everybody

01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:01,600
who is new here

01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:07,920
uh so whipple had a question

01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:09,760
fox folks who are interested in

01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:11,760
organizing federal women's day or who

01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:14,320
have already organized

01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:15,600
so who have already organized we want to

01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:18,480
collect their username

01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:20,239
so that we can see uh yeah so we want to

01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:21,040
collect their face id so we can track

01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:23,840
direct

01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:24,800
like activity and just plot it on a

01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:27,840
global map

01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:30,000
and then for um

01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:32,000
for this year's fedora women's day we

01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:34,840
will collaborate together with the

01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,480
dni team does this does that answer your

01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:41,440
question

01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:41,440
wait not sure anyway

01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:47,360
i don't know what is going on in the

01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:53,800
chat

01:26:50,730 --> 01:26:53,800
[Music]

01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:06,800
so fast is going away you can open it to

01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:06,800
get registered

01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:14,800
yeah is this free ipa

01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:19,600
i think we have we can tr

01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:22,239
yeah so we can open one

01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:24,080
alberto do you want to open this ticket

01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:27,840
or

01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:27,840
uh in the new repo

01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:34,320
okay am i the only one who's

01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:40,080
ah you you are not audible i think

01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:47,840
your voice is breaking i cannot

01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:47,840
understand nasty

01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:04,400
yeah even

01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:05,199
okay so i just opened up we had 30

01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:09,040
minutes

01:28:05,199 --> 01:28:09,520
and i think for the last 30 minutes we

01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:11,679
have two

01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:12,880
options so one suggestion is like

01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:15,760
justice

01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:17,120
that we tried old comm ups tickets and

01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:19,199
the other suggestion was

01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:20,800
what we discussed at the beginning of

01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:24,159
the session

01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:27,280
that we will try to make a com blog post

01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:28,000
on some quick metrics for fedora just

01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:31,440
like maybe

01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:35,360
one about um some group like

01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:35,760
ambassadors and how how distributed they

01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:38,239
are

01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:39,679
or glow over the globe or like packages

01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:41,679
or something like that

01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:43,520
so do we want to discuss the com block

01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:45,280
post and what we want to put in it like

01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:49,280
which metrics or do we want to

01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:49,280
do the track ticket trash

01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:53,600
should i i will create can i create a

01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:57,679
call in this chat

01:28:53,600 --> 01:29:01,540
wait know it should be

01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:04,649
generally not only for this chat okay

01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:04,649
[Music]

01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:12,800
looks like it

01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:14,880
maybe i will just say plus one if you

01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:17,920
want to get right that was one thing

01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:21,280
plus i was really interested in

01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:23,760
sorry um i loved it

01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:25,520
if we can collaborate with cpe team on

01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:28,560
the um

01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:30,400
on the replacement that would definitely

01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:32,560
help us a lot so we can focus more on

01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:35,199
the data work and less on the

01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:36,159
joys of authentication systems i think

01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:38,000
alberto

01:29:36,159 --> 01:29:39,520
before cutting off said he will open a

01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:42,639
ticket there

01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:42,639
so i'm just going to

01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:48,800
so so please just put plus one or plus

01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:51,440
two depending on

01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:53,840
what you want to discuss next for the 20

01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,840
minutes

01:29:54,000 --> 01:30:01,920
hello hey yeah just a little

01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:05,440
to go back on the first thing if

01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:08,000
you get to this i'm sure someone will

01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:08,960
i think they will just like open a pull

01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:13,120
request to you

01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:15,360
to the gofp project and that

01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:16,400
avoids you to go and read the talk and

01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:20,080
like

01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:22,239
understand the new bits and pieces

01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:23,600
it's difficult for us to know every

01:30:22,239 --> 01:30:26,639
single application that

01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:29,199
because using a first client but

01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:29,840
if you know about it just put tickets in

01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:35,360
this

01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:38,880
this repository and it's easier to track

01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:38,880
awesome that's really helpful to know

01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:50,080
um so i guess on the poll results

01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:50,880
if no one has any other opinions do we

01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:55,360
do some

01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:55,360
ticket triage awesome alberto thank you

01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:02,239
i'll subscribe to that ticket now so i

01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:04,480
don't lose track of it

01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:04,480
cool

01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:10,960
um so i mentioned the it came to mind

01:31:09,199 --> 01:31:13,679
just really last minute on the ticket

01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:16,080
triage but i was thinking like oh wow

01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:17,679
we're opening a lot of new tickets again

01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:20,560
and then i remember wait a minute we've

01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:20,560
done this before

01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:25,199
so i figure maybe before we keep going

01:31:23,199 --> 01:31:27,360
ahead on

01:31:25,199 --> 01:31:29,520
new tickets we can just do a quick pass

01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:32,800
on some of our really old ones

01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:35,199
and um just decide if it's like

01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:36,320
is it worth keeping open even like i

01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:37,679
think the challenge is that there's a

01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:41,280
lot of great ideas

01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:42,960
in our tickets but um

01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:44,320
some of them are just too big or out of

01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:47,600
scope right now

01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:49,360
so maybe we can just try to figure that

01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,560
out of like what makes sense to keep and

01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:55,679
what doesn't

01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:57,840
i could share my screen if

01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:59,120
that works which i guess this will be a

01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:02,719
heavy um

01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:03,520
um very heavy on the team so if you want

01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:05,120
to jump off

01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:06,719
we'll probably talk ticket triage it'll

01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:08,320
be super meta but if you want to hang

01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:12,320
out you're also welcome to

01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:13,920
um so the thing i think that would

01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:15,840
probably be

01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:17,520
helpful to start are the metrics one

01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:20,719
since we've been talking a lot about

01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:22,880
metrics um maybe we can start with

01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:25,120
some of those and maybe wrap them into

01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:27,840
the current conversations

01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:29,280
um so i see oh there's probably an

01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:31,120
easier way no that one

01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:33,199
no i can't do that we have metrics

01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:36,320
tickets right

01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:37,920
um so i'm gonna focus on these ones that

01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:39,440
are over two years old

01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:40,880
actually i would love to talk about that

01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:42,719
one because we keep getting new

01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:43,600
contributors who go to that ticket and

01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:46,639
then

01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:50,159
it gets stuck um

01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:54,080
so instead of me talking

01:32:50,159 --> 01:32:56,159
why don't we maybe start with um

01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:58,639
186 because this is one that gets a lot

01:32:56,159 --> 01:33:00,239
of attention from newer contributors

01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:02,560
um which has always been an interesting

01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:04,880
idea but i was just wondering if anyone

01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:09,840
has actually tested word cloud bot

01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:09,840
or if like it works at all

01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:15,040
so we used to run it we used to run it

01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:17,920
on our fedora community twitter but this

01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:21,040
was like four years ago

01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:23,840
i can test it if you want but i am not

01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,840
sure if

01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,320
i need to check if it has any fast

01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:32,000
related things in the code but otherwise

01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:32,000
i can test it if it works

01:33:32,159 --> 01:33:36,000
i think that would be at least helpful

01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:37,760
to move that one forward because

01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,920
the issue we keep getting like we could

01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:42,960
probably work with um

01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:45,360
the infrared team about getting

01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:47,040
hosting set up if we can do the work

01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:48,840
ourselves but just to get somewhere to

01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:50,960
run it maybe we can work on getting an

01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:53,120
aws

01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:54,960
short term can you drop i think having

01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:58,480
that answer

01:33:54,960 --> 01:34:01,600
sorry to the repo yeah yeah

01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:05,199
yeah so

01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:06,000
first thing is yeah first thing it looks

01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:09,520
like you need to

01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,520
port it to fedora messaging

01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:17,360
and oh yeah actually and

01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:18,080
i don't know if you were in the cp talk

01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:21,120
before but

01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:25,600
pingu has been working on a application

01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:29,360
called toddlers that is a bit like

01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:31,520
you know like those

01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:33,920
functional service or whatever so you

01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:35,840
get all the

01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:37,679
all the boiler plates to listen to

01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:39,120
messages and you can just like drop a

01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:40,639
python file or

01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:42,320
like your class or your function that

01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:45,199
does the processing

01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:46,080
in this toddler application so that

01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:48,320
could become

01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:49,679
actually a toddler and then you don't

01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:52,400
have to think about

01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:55,280
hosting and consuming messaging anything

01:34:52,400 --> 01:35:01,840
like that you just maintain the logic of

01:34:55,280 --> 01:35:01,840
of the consumer

01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:07,119
and on the cpe side i don't know if

01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:10,000
maybe maybe the cobbler piece would

01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:11,840
overlap here but um do you think this is

01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,880
something that if we came to the cpe

01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:15,040
team with like

01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:18,560
asking for an aws instance we could spin

01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:21,600
something up just to like play around

01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:26,719
yeah i think open the ticket and i

01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:30,639
don't see any reason why not work

01:35:26,719 --> 01:35:33,119
awesome so i'll make a note of that um

01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:34,719
the the action item or the requirement

01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:37,920
on this ticket i'm gonna say

01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:41,040
is um um

01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:44,480
oh dependent on whether

01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:48,080
word cloud bot works which

01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:49,440
will tag b on that one so once we get a

01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:51,440
thumbs up or thumbs down

01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:54,159
i think if it doesn't work like it's a

01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:56,239
cool app and i like word cloud bot but i

01:35:54,159 --> 01:35:58,560
don't know

01:35:56,239 --> 01:36:00,639
if it's worth a ton of time and labor on

01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:03,119
our part like i'd rather put that into g

01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:05,600
oh toddlers now i've i've definitely

01:36:03,119 --> 01:36:05,600
heard that

01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:12,159
um

01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:14,000
all the jokes in the in the chat

01:36:12,159 --> 01:36:15,600
yesterday so

01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,880
once we figure out if it's working if it

01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:18,239
works and we don't want to do a lot of

01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:20,560
work to get word cloud

01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:21,440
running i figure like hey why not run it

01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:23,679
again because

01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:24,480
just plug it into the existing places

01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:27,600
but

01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:28,719
um if it doesn't work i i would rather

01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:31,440
spend more

01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:32,960
time and energy on things like gofp

01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:36,159
because i think that's just

01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:37,440
an interesting project right now um but

01:36:36,159 --> 01:36:39,600
just the feedback i think that'll be a

01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:42,800
good way

01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:44,480
so i'll i'll leave this comment there

01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:48,800
i'll follow up and polish this stuff

01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:52,320
after our session um

01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:54,159
the next one is the toolbox repo

01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:55,840
so does anybody know what the toolbox

01:36:54,159 --> 01:36:58,880
repo it was supposed to be

01:36:55,840 --> 01:37:00,719
other than like maybe me or alberto

01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:03,040
does anyone actually know what we were

01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:06,719
talking about with that

01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:09,600
i think i know a little bit but

01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:11,360
it was mostly like this collection of

01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:14,400
scripts right to collect different

01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:14,400
community metrics

01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:17,760
yeah so the toolbox the idea behind this

01:37:17,119 --> 01:37:19,840
was

01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:22,000
acro over the years whether it was the

01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:25,679
fed message to course work

01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:27,280
or the gofp scripts we've had a lot of

01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:29,040
scripts that are doing data science

01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:30,960
metrics he work just floating out there

01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:33,840
on pagor but

01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:35,600
they're not always easy to find the

01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:37,600
toolbox was the idea of like

01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:40,080
bringing all of those together into one

01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:41,360
repo and trying to manage them in one

01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:44,560
place

01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:47,040
but this was two years ago and gofp

01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:49,199
was literally like one python script

01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:50,239
then it looks a little bit more than it

01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:53,520
was

01:37:50,239 --> 01:37:55,760
before i'm just wondering if

01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:57,520
it makes sense to close this one and

01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:59,040
like reopen if it makes sense

01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:00,560
but i don't know i'm not really

01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,520
motivated to work on this one because i

01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:03,040
think geofp

01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:04,800
is kind of like it's going to be enough

01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:05,520
on its own but that's that's just how i

01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:08,880
feel

01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:12,560
curious if anyone else has opinions or

01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:12,560
if i should just close this one as stale

01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:17,920
i guess it's really what is the value of

01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:19,360
centralizing like what is the value in

01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:20,800
the work of bringing all of our stuff

01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:22,880
together versus just

01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:26,000
leaving it where it is right now like is

01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:30,480
that work worth doing

01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:33,040
um question

01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:34,080
and i don't know because i'm not i'm not

01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:37,280
super

01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:39,280
tapped into where um

01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:40,960
our most active scripts are like when i

01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:43,600
opened this two years ago we had like

01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:45,840
three or four different repos but

01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:47,440
okay so i see the feedback in the chat

01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:48,080
that we can probably just do plus one to

01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:51,199
close

01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:55,360
so if anyone disagrees with me

01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:59,119
um we can always reopen

01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:59,119
2020 oh

01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:02,880
i'll follow up with a comment with extra

01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:05,360
context after

01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:06,639
nest um oh some of this is actually

01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:08,320
probably more relevant actually what we

01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:10,080
were talking about and this i think also

01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:12,480
came from bex which i think was also

01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:16,639
interesting context

01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:20,080
metrics visualization of packages

01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:23,760
so this is a huge thing but

01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:23,760
i'm just wondering if there is

01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:27,119
okay we don't really have a lot of

01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:28,080
discussion here it's a pretty short

01:39:27,119 --> 01:39:30,000
ticket

01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:31,280
it's a great idea but i think we never

01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,920
really scoped it down

01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:35,280
and also a lot of things have happened

01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:37,280
in the last two years

01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:38,840
i think what bex really wanted to know

01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:42,880
at the time

01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:44,960
was um uh he wants to know

01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:47,119
what packages get updated every fedora

01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:50,239
release versus ones that don't

01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:53,119
and how long do new package reviews take

01:39:50,239 --> 01:39:54,880
um i think those are the two oh shoot i

01:39:53,119 --> 01:39:57,360
also just noticed that we're at

01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:58,080
time and that people are starting to to

01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:59,920
walk out

01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:01,679
or starting to leave so we can try to

01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:04,560
speed through these last two i guess

01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:04,560
before we wrap up

01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:09,600
so i guess the question is and i don't

01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:12,480
know but do we have

01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:15,679
tools that would make it easy to do we

01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:17,520
have to build new tools to get this data

01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:19,679
or can we get this data with our

01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:21,280
existing tools that is my question

01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:22,960
that is what answers this question of to

01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:25,440
me whether we keep this ticket open or

01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:25,440
close it

01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:33,440
and i don't like i know we technically

01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:38,159
have it with fed message but

01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:38,159
i don't think we really have tools yeah

01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:44,400
okay you know for the updates maybe you

01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:47,119
can

01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:47,119
use body

01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:53,920
i guess you'd have to write some kind of

01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:56,159
script to parse the fed message data

01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:57,440
so it is doable i guess that was always

01:40:56,159 --> 01:40:58,880
the thing is we always have known you

01:40:57,440 --> 01:41:00,960
can do stuff with like this with our

01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:04,239
data it's just a matter of

01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:06,239
scaffolding and doing the work um i like

01:41:04,239 --> 01:41:07,520
the idea but i'm tempted to say we close

01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:09,920
this as stale

01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:12,880
and if we want to revisit we propose to

01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:15,360
break it up into smaller pieces

01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:16,400
i think right now it's just too much

01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:19,360
work for folks

01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:20,960
who are working on all the all the other

01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:23,280
stuff too

01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:24,960
so i'd be plus one to close personally

01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:28,080
it's a great idea but just too much for

01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:32,080
us to take on right now

01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:33,840
oh and seeing us here

01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:35,760
night and thanks for thanks for tuning

01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:38,480
in through a power outage like what what

01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:38,480
happened there

01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:42,880
i'm just like scrolling through the chat

01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:45,040
now like wow

01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:47,199
okay i think this might be a good uh i

01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:49,280
don't know if if you struggle to know

01:41:47,199 --> 01:41:52,800
where you can get the

01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:56,560
data that might be a good idea to maybe

01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:59,199
put a devil list in their thread or

01:41:56,560 --> 01:42:01,040
something like this like oh i want i

01:41:59,199 --> 01:42:03,520
will uh we would like to

01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:05,440
uh get this type of information and just

01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:09,280
see

01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:11,520
the answers on their list

01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:13,119
because sometimes so let me raise you

01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:16,320
this question

01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:18,159
um instead of closing it out and leaving

01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:19,280
it to dust where it'll be forgotten

01:42:18,159 --> 01:42:21,119
eventually

01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:22,719
does it make sense if i open this ticket

01:42:21,119 --> 01:42:24,480
in an infra ticket for back

01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:26,000
for getting into a backlog somewhere or

01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,400
getting someone else to look at it like

01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,560
should i

01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:30,080
just move this ticket somewhere else

01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:33,440
yeah

01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:37,040
i think i don't well

01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:39,199
i think if you request uh information

01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:40,080
it you know it's going to be easier for

01:42:39,199 --> 01:42:42,320
someone to just

01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:44,480
reply oh yeah you can actually maybe get

01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:47,280
this data by doing this this this

01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:49,600
i kind of give you uh all my then like

01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:52,639
having someone like maybe spending a day

01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:54,239
writing the script so when i see this

01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:57,600
ticket i think

01:42:54,239 --> 01:43:00,159
well for someone that

01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:01,199
maybe knows python or whatever what's

01:43:00,159 --> 01:43:04,400
difficult in

01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:05,199
like uh working on this ticket is just

01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:08,239
to know

01:43:05,199 --> 01:43:10,080
where i can get the data or

01:43:08,239 --> 01:43:12,080
because after the technical path

01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:14,400
shouldn't be too hard if it's like

01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:15,600
creating some apis or consuming some

01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:17,760
message

01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:20,480
i think it's something that you can do

01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:20,800
the the knowledge that is missing here

01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:24,560
it's

01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:27,679
where where or which system do i need to

01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:28,480
to query or where is the data available

01:43:27,679 --> 01:43:30,960
for

01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:33,040
all that i think this is maybe something

01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:36,560
for

01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:39,040
maybe cpe or more like the the general

01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:39,840
like packager they will be stuffing

01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:44,719
people will

01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:44,719
have some ideas maybe there

01:43:49,199 --> 01:43:53,280
i open a new fedora infrastructure

01:43:51,119 --> 01:43:54,800
ticket just to start a conversation and

01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:55,360
then we'll figure out where to take it

01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:58,639
from there

01:43:55,360 --> 01:44:00,639
sound good yeah or actually

01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:02,560
i'll just send an email to the list i

01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:05,199
think the conversation are

01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:06,320
easier on the list than the ticket

01:44:05,199 --> 01:44:09,520
because

01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:11,679
we got it forget is wow it's

01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:13,119
it's better to have a ticket at least in

01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:14,880
the infra project

01:44:13,119 --> 01:44:16,639
something that we can quickly close or

01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:20,159
not then rather than having something

01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:22,639
that stays open for years

01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:24,880
totally feel that i probably wouldn't be

01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:28,639
having this conversation right now

01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:31,280
yeah so i will i will take the action

01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:32,639
to post to the info list about this

01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:33,840
before i close the ticket

01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:36,320
so at least there's a chance that it

01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:40,880
will go somewhere meaningful

01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:43,760
um maybe just the last one before we

01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:44,400
wrap up for the afternoon the evening

01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:47,679
the morning

01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:49,199
whatever time zone um so this was a

01:44:47,679 --> 01:44:51,920
ticket that was also open

01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:52,320
this is probably our oldest ticket oh my

01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:56,400
lord

01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:59,040
2017. um which was also a great idea

01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:59,600
of tracking better getting better info

01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:01,920
about

01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:03,360
community blog and fedora magazine which

01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:07,360
do already have

01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:08,159
great um dashboards of metrics you just

01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:11,199
have to log

01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:14,880
in and go through the wordpress stuff to

01:45:11,199 --> 01:45:15,440
to uh see it uh yeah see like i'm having

01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:16,800
to like

01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:18,480
click through all of this like so you

01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:20,560
can get all this really interesting data

01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:22,320
but it's not in fed message and it's not

01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:24,560
in anything that's a fedora system it's

01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:29,040
all local to the wordpress site

01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:31,040
um once it loads uh yeah so you can get

01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:32,400
five years of data on all of our posts

01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:35,199
and how many views they get

01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:36,800
and where those views come from like

01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:38,639
really interesting stuff

01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:40,080
fedora nest wow that usually you never

01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:41,600
get things that show up there usually

01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:45,199
it's just always unknown

01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:46,639
yeah anyways um so it's interesting data

01:45:45,199 --> 01:45:50,239
but the challenge that came

01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:54,400
that was with this ticket was getting it

01:45:50,239 --> 01:45:56,239
into like fed message to um

01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:57,600
understand like i think paul friels

01:45:56,239 --> 01:46:00,000
reached out here with some

01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:02,159
questions and ideas of things that would

01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:05,360
be useful from the magazine side

01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:07,440
but again we just kind of stalled out on

01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:09,600
that after the 2018 fad because it was

01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:11,360
just a huge amount of work because

01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:13,679
we had to bridge wordpress to fed

01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:15,920
message so the question i think

01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:18,320
is again like do we just close this as

01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:21,600
stale or do we kick it off

01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:24,159
as a thread somewhere else like

01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:25,840
this one i don't know much because while

01:46:24,159 --> 01:46:27,760
it is interesting

01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:30,080
i don't like i don't know of an easy way

01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:32,880
to do the work that this ticket was

01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:34,480
asking for like unlike the the met

01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:35,760
packages one we're like oh we know that

01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:39,199
data is there and

01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:41,119
we can find it i don't like again we

01:46:39,199 --> 01:46:42,800
can't we know we have that data but it's

01:46:41,119 --> 01:46:43,440
a lot harder to find now because now

01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:47,199
it's not in

01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:49,920
fedora anything so

01:46:47,199 --> 01:46:51,520
yeah and i just don't know i guess does

01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:55,040
it make sense to kick this anywhere

01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:55,520
or just close it i think this one will

01:46:55,040 --> 01:47:00,239
be

01:46:55,520 --> 01:47:00,239
