for a insane six years

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,679

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,840

of those years burnt out over the time

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,199
which is pretty good for a fedora

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,199

i see you're making a face at me it

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:34,430

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,680
years now

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,280
i start and come ups a little bit then

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,040
for marketing and then

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,280
just jumping from irc channels and

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,959
try to gather people into the marketing

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,200
stuff

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,840
and i'm the manager representative

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,840
science a month ago

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,840
probably

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,959
cool

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,759
now what people ask us questions and we

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,240
answer them

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:41,120
yes excellent plan i did say we could uh

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,120
just you know make stuff up for

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,800
30 and 40 minutes or whatever so what's

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,160
this council thing

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,880
what is the council yeah i'll take that

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,560
one

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,960
um especially because we have a lot of

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,479
new people here uh so i think this is

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,160
actually a good topic

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,120
um long ago fedora was governed by a

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,840
board

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,320
and um and then had a federal project

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,240
leader

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,600
and then not much structure at all to

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,919
anything and

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,560
that worked okay but it was hard to set

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,680
kind of an

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,680
overall strategic direction and

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,280
kind of then try and aim the whole

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,160
project towards a thing that we wanted

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,280
to do

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,840
and that sometimes meant that a lot of

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,120
um you know our mailing list discussion

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,560
slash arguments

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,560
ended up going nowhere with no

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,320
resolution and

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,160
we didn't really have the ability to

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,479
make big steps forward

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,880
in a way that was controlled and since

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,520
fedora is about making big steps forward

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,440
that kind of became problematic so we

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,600
instituted a new governance structure

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,080
with kind of a more hands-on approach

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,919
and with an actual org chart underneath

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,039
it rather than

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,600
chaos and it has generally worked pretty

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,720
well

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,039
we have a number of appointed people

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,240
which are paid positions by red hat

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,840
that's me marie

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:05,440
and ben we also have elected

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,080
positions um alexandra and

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,400
dennis gilmore is currently that and

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,759
then we have some positions that are

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:17,360
um brought to the council by important

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:20,880
uh representative bodies in fedora so um

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,039
david is here representing fesco and

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,440
justin's representing diversity and

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,960
inclusion and edward is representing the

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,960
mindshare committee as well

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,319
and this yes that's the overall picture

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,080
if you're muted in a qa session or you

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:49,840
mute it in real life

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:49,840
what is real life even then

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,639
in a long-term view

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,479
i would love for someone other than me

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:02,479
to answer that question

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:05,759
well i sit here and sip

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,720
well for me until now i see that

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,000
uh federation continue to try to drive

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,479
innovation into this

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,840
into the force we're into the free open

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,919
source work

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,039
uh although by the help with red hat

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,300
there's a lot of people that

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,479
still fears about the ibm

00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,599
[Music]

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,240
with red hat but until now we are doing

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,800
it

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,080
uh as we can as community and the

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,520
community is the the

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,440
fedora project the federal project is

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,440
not the os that we

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,960
oh that almost all we use i'm using

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,680
android right now because i'm on my

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,319
phone

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,960
but the fedora project is the people so

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,800
fedora

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,160
will continue to be the community that

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,879
it is now

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,879
no matter what

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,960
i have slightly different and

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:59,840
more about the future of rpm packaging

00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:03,039
and generally like linux distributions

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:06,080
because i came from devops background

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,919
where people try to say that packaging

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,440
doesn't matter anymore and

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:14,479
the new devops ways are doing it

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,199
differently and i strongly disagree with

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,160
that i

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,360
think that all devops ways will just

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,840
evolve towards

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,039
uh something similar to what packaging

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,759
does right now

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,879
and it's either it will be us with rpm

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,120
packaging there

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,199
or it will be something else but will

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,200
which will act the same way

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:37,760
so i see the future of fedora is like

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,719
developing further the approach to

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,000
packaging the approach to the culture of

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:47,120
maintainers the culture of community uh

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,560
owning some space where you can share

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,320
the resources

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:55,760
it uh rather than just consume stuff so

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:59,680
i see fedora becoming like

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,800
the pool or rp package is becoming the

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,240
pool of

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:07,839
of these packaged boxes

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,240
like a small stuff so everyone can use

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,360
this

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,640
uh to build their own solutions but it

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,440
all comes back to

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,200
these basics basic bricks which you need

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,600
to use to build something larger

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,399
in the end and bigger and more

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,360
interesting

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:26,800
maybe to some people but yeah we're

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:30,240
still the foundation of it all

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,880
i'd like to see a future fedora uh that

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,760
you know kind of leads community and

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,800
diversity

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,200
and inclusion and

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,760
we could build up more of our

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,160
demographics i think we all know

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,800
the split right now i'd like to see more

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,519
ladies

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,600
and black indigenous and people of color

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,920
involved in fedora

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,720
all over so that's something i hope that

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,480
we can

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,920
accomplish i want to say that we're

00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,920
such beautiful dreamers

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,079
yes

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:12,320
you need to dream what drives you uh

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:16,320
i remember uh yeah my path towards

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:19,360
open source started when a long time ago

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,560
and at that time i was reading some

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,279
blog articles and uh it was jared smith

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,600
actually

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,640
who wrote the article former fedora

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,399
project lead

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,720
and he wrote something like in open

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,040
source you really need to be bold you

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,440
know you need to just start doing and do

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,120
that

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,360
and eventually you get somewhere and uh

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,320
there is nothing else just to be bold

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,320
enough to

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,320
to try and and then we'll see

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,320
uh this is kind of a quick one would

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,560
like to

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,360
uh what's the state of the new fedora

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,040
logo

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,480
unless someone else had something to add

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,959
to that last one i realized i just

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,959
jumped in

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,839
the state of the fedora logo should i

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,839
talk about that

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,480
all right so basically it's in legal

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,079
right now

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,839
still and uh we have to make a couple

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,600
more iterations

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:19,120
as we all know the f

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,399
it's close to the facebook f

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,839
so legally it's a you know a trademark

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,760
that's owned by red hat

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,959
so they're quite involved in this

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,760
process so we're doing our best

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:35,120
but uh it's gonna be a long timeline

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,120
that's just the truth of that

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,920
sad face um don't don't look at the logo

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,839
on my

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,839
avatar that's all i'm saying

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,800
uh and then this one seems like a good

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,560
one maybe the council would like to talk

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:57,839
a bit about what they've been doing over

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,839
the past year

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,240
sending email reading email

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,200
um you know one things i've been focused

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,680
on

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,040
is trying to you know i think we have

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,040
some good processes

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,480
in terms of you know program management

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,639
stuff but

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,240
there are a lot of rough edges or corner

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,760
cases that we haven't addressed and so

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,200
i've spent a lot of time

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,760
trying to to polish what we have

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,720
since i'm always cooking that's not a

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,920
question

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,160
people have um

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,160
it's like we just we just have we just

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,920
now have a process for promoting things

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,639
to addition because we haven't done that

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,800
in a while

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,880
and then we tried that with iot and

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,839
realized it we missed a lot of

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,959
uh a lot of steps that we probably

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,880
should have done so we're

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,040
just basically trying to figure out and

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:53,839
document

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:53,839
all the things we work on

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,079
has anyone else been doing stuff in the

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,079
last year

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,600
i know i've been doing stuff all over it

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,440
just seems so

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,720
interwoven like i'm like wait was that a

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,760
mind share thing

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,560
or a council thing i think we can count

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,240
it as

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,959
all all of these uh activities

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,720
under the umbrella of console and right

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,680
so one thing i've been doing i actually

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,760
used to

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,040
follow the council is like code of

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,320
conduct stuff

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:27,120
that takes up a lot of time for

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,920
community manager and for project leo

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,800
takes up

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,360
a lot of our time because uh you know we

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,600
have to

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,120
read that process that get all the

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,560
background and then

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,800
uh gather gather more information maybe

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,079
talk to people about it then potentially

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,480
go to our legal team

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,000
then it could be multiple making very

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,240
hard decisions about

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,720
difficult things right yeah for the

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,360
things and we want to keep everyone's

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,120
um inclusion in mind and make sure it's

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,880
fair for people and

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,639
you know make sure it's safe for people

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,720
so it actually that's

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,680
uh something that's taken up a lot of my

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,079
time in the last

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,519
five months there's a reason i put that

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:09,199
slide in the

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,800
keynote absolutely

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,040
another cool thing i've been doing is

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,600
the ambassador revamp

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,440
proposal you know kind of getting all

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,120
this feedback from the community on a

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,680
couple mailing lists the

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,680
the conversation popped up again and i

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,399
said you know what this is the time

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,279
to make a change with this so i took

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,639
that feedback

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:34,160
and i made a plan and we got feedback

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,720
made changes um we're in just the

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,040
beginning

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,959
the beginning process of that but it's

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,760
pretty sweet we got two co-leads and we

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,760
have

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,639
a small group of volunteers kind of

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,560
gathering up and after nest is over

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,160
it's going to be some beginning meetings

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,160
so i'm really excited about that

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,079
i can talk a little bit for the last

00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,120
days would you like to introduce

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,600
yourself

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,199
oh oh yeah sure sorry i'm late i had a

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,839
work meeting that run over

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,680
20 minutes and you know just what you

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,120
want on a friday afternoon

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,160
um happens it does so i'm dennis gilmore

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,800
i am

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,399
one of the two elected members of the

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,600
federal council

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,920
um i was for

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,040
about a decade the fedora release

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,160
engineer

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,199
and now working on multiple architecture

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,680
stuff inside of

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,680
red hat

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,120
i was on fesco and been heavily involved

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:40,480
in fedora for

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:43,600
many many years so that's me

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,600
justin did you want to go ahead

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,360
yeah so just to list a little bit on my

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,920
side to the earlier question of

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,560
i had the question but it's not from me

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,759
because i

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:59,759
i'm not just in the middle of talking

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,399
oh sorry i wasn't hearing it might be a

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,399
delay there

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,000
there's a delay i think there's a little

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:12,320
bit of a delay

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,759
okay um so it was just around so

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,920
really thinking about volunteer

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,320
sustainability and making

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,839
making and helping keep it a a place

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,480
where we like to contribute to fedora

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,240
even if

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,720
it's not something you work on all the

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,480
time or so really like one example of

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,240
that is earlier this year on the fedora

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,920
badges side which has always been this

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,480
kind of community

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,839
lots of community con contributions to

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,480
that project through the design

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,000
side but also through the software side

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,040
we've been working on

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,560
uh with some folks and friends um at

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,639
concentric sky who

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,000
are also have been building the same

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,720
open badge spec

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,279
we're looking at trying to refresh the

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:55,279
fedora badges uh

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:57,360
web app not just to make it easier and

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,680
more simple to work with but also to be

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,720
more creative with ways that we use it

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,400
to make you know kind of always

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,319
do these fun things that we do in the

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,360
fedora community as another tool

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,319
to make it a going back to like the

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,839
friends part of the four

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,079
foundations so that's kind of like a

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,760
community project that has been

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,360
related to some of the conversations

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,640
we've been having in the dni team and

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,079
i'm really excited

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,079
even at even at nest there's been a

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,199
couple of talks already about that work

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,240
that was done

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,200
through the last outreachy internship um

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,320
on the fedora badges stack so it's

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,000
really great to see that progress

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,840
starting to move forward

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,280
but other than that i'm really i'm

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,360
really interested on

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,039
or the dni team has been having a lot of

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,000
conversations about how

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,880
we can uh set ourselves up to be more

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,799
sustainable

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,480
and also be better at bringing in an

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,640
onboarding new contributors

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,720
so a lot of our conversations right now

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,559
are really trying to think

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,240
think about ways that we can engage

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,840
better with the fedora community

00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:01,360
and be a better conduit for feedback

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,799
and being a part of the process

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,559
in whether it's part of the fedora

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,200
council or other parts of the project

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,360
that

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,400
would like that dna perspective that's

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,760
part of what

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,280
when i when i stepped up for the the

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,039
representative role that was something

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,840
that i was really interested in

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,120
of trying to spend my time and focus on

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,240
over the next

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,080
one or maybe two releases so that's kind

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,640
of a little bit of what i'm looking at

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,240
and

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,840
what's been going on for the last few

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,840
months and my side of thing

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,320
do we want to go over every question

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,960
trying to message my internet provider

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,360
on twitter in the background here

00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:52,880
[Laughter]

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,480
uh what is fedora going to have us focus

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,320
what is fedora going to focus on for the

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,200
upcoming years

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,160
anything particular fun or making the

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,640
distro better

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,640
or both

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,559
is it the same thing

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,560
like making distro better in a very

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,160
funny way

00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:18,160
[Laughter]

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:22,480
i i think um we want to focus on making

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,679
our internal services we provide to our

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,480
distro builder

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,280
people better both the people making

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,039
things like

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:33,360
the compnero spin or fedora jam

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,400
things like modularity which i know is

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,520
is rough

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,039
but is um basically ultimately a tool to

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,280
make it so that you can take

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,160
all these packages and put them into

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,240
something that

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,240
solves a problem for somebody and

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,520
continue to make the high quality

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,080
collection of package software uh that

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,880
is

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,880
the main fedora rpm collection and to

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,360
continue to increase the quality of that

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,080
and our skill at automating that

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,480
packaging

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,159
and making that those things available

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,840
to people

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,360
so that we can grow the community

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,159
through these other

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,240
interesting fedora outputs like fedora

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,520
llama spin

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,559
like fedora llama spin uh our fedora

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,679
a former f-cake was very excited

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:22,799
about having llama farmers use fedora

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:25,039
for some reason i think

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,280
one initiative worth mentioning for this

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:30,480
particular part is also the

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:33,360
like simplification of uh building the

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,640
images which can be used in on various

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,039
infrastructures this is

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,480
this there will be a talk about this i

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,760
think even

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,480
tomorrow or maybe on a sunday about

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:47,280
uh decoupling like the building of the

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,960
iso image from building the distribution

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:53,360
packages and so giving more flexibility

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,159
for the user to

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,720
play with various images on various

00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,679
target

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,640
platforms so not just considering iso

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,919
image alone

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,559
for the applications so it's

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,679
in general it's adding the flexibility

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,360
how you can apply

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,320
fedora on various setups and for various

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,559
use k

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,600
it's a very interesting development uh

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,120
what's going

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:22,799
in the fedora project right now

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:26,080
all right also go ahead i'd like to add

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:28,640
um there are many changes going in

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,360
i know ben mentioned that this most

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,000
recent uh development cycle has more

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,520
changes uh change proposals approved

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,640
than we've ever had

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,280
um so that's both good and bad because

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,880
uh

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,919
it means we're probably gonna have a lot

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,320
more testing and and cleanup to do but

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,000
uh

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,039
it's it's good because it's what we want

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,960
to do in fedora moving things forward

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,400
and i think that in the coming year

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,520
we're going to continue seeing

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,880
a lot come from the workstation

00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:01,039
um sort of addition of fedora and

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,200
because we've already seen a lot of

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:07,200
really nice improvements there for

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,080
end users uh for i mean laptop users for

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,240
lack of a better

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,000
term uh and i think we're going to

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,200
continue seeing that

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,799
um matthew i'm sure you mentioned

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:22,240
the um lenovo uh

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:25,360
fedora pre-installation so perhaps uh

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:28,000
you know that being successful will

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,880
be you know great for the project maybe

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,799
we'll see more

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,640
uh in the future i have no idea i'm not

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,200
involved with any of that stuff

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,520
but i think we'll see a lot of that uh

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,919
which will be of interest to

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,520
many users and developers that's in

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,120
addition to the things that

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,720
we continue to see happen in fedora

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,600
which are

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,760
changes and development procedures that

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,720
allow fedora to continue to act as an

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,039
effective

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,159
upstream for the projects that rely on

00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,799
it

00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,919
those projects primarily being centos

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,280
and rel

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,400
so we this is actually additionally to

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,919
that i

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,640
i'm glad to see now the existing of

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,039
other

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,919
communities in fedora not just uh

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,240
centralized and

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,360
rel and i think it's very important and

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,880
i would love to see

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:22,320
more uh so uh we become not just

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:25,360
uh one uh distribution but

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:29,280
uh reach out to wider areas and

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:32,080
and we can be uh used as a platform for

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,039
many different uses not just one and

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,520
alone

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,200
and this of course it creates uh

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,840
additional challenges because the more

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,480
people

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,320
with different backgrounds come the more

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,200
complicated it is to like talk to each

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,520
other and to

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,520
find the decisions but this is where it

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,080
becomes interesting and this is where

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,520
we need to show the strength of of the

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:56,720
process we have and

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,720
and the community uh which we work with

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,640
i have a vision for the future of the

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,000
next year which is getting really good

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,480
at virtual events

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,880
we are going to have access to this

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,039
hop-in platform for a year

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,039
so let's take advantage of it we're

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,120
going to formalize some kind of

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,559
process so that folks can propose that

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,039
i'm thinking about

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,159
fedora activity days i'm thinking about

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,200
local

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,960
meetups uh in your time zone um

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,559
you know you're in the session right now

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,960
think about it and think about what you

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:30,480
could potentially do with it

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,039
people reach out to get some of this

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,080
access

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:36,080
to this platform do we have it right so

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,679
that's going to be a process that we

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,200
established so right now

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:44,799
uh working on a contract within

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,760
osbo with hopkin and within all that

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,200
there became like a lot of red tape so

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,039
right now we're we're on

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:56,080
apaches account very graciously

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,600
uh so once we have like access to the

00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,880
other one we could talk more about how

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,679
that's gonna work but

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,799
i mean as long as the event isn't i'm

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,000
pretty sure you can run

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,799
as many events there is some cost as far

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,840
as each

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,120
person it's like a registration fee and

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,320
then there's also a class that we're

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,840
going to share with um

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,919
ospo and some other communities right so

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,080
like oh yep rich you're welcome thank

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,000
you rich

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,520
so anyway that's a process that will be

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,159
formalized i think we should get

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,799
really good at doing virtual events and

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:31,919
we have this platform too

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,919
to use and learn about

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,720
there's a bunch more questions in the

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,720
chat

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,000
the next one i think was how objectives

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,120
and new features are selected to be

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,120
included in fedora

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,640
um we just talked about objectives at

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,120
our last

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,840
council meeting and and the process for

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,440
this

00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:00,240
right right before this um generally

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,960
uh by our our charter selecting the

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,360
objectives

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,559
is our actual main function as the

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,000
fedora council

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:11,520
and we try to have two of them running

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,360
at a time um and work

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:17,039
uh and they go for 12 to 18 months

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,520
um every time we go through this we're

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,440
getting better at the proper doing it as

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,159
that as that happens so we try to make

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,080
sure that there are

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,600
actionable things that can have a

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,919
defined end time and

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,000
try to provide as much support to that

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,640
as possible

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,840
but generally once a proposal is there

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,520
the process is

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,039
do we have a strong lead for that

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,720
proposal

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,080
and then does it fit with where we're

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,240
trying to go as

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,919
you know fedora right now does it go to

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,400
our long-term goals and is it

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,600
the thing we need to do now to get there

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,799
and if so

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,159
yes so that's for the kind of the big

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:55,520
objectives things for

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:58,720
for changes um i will let ben answer

00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,720
that especially because my internet

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,039
yeah so for technical changes within uh

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,720
release

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,480
the process is basically somebody

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,480
decides to do it

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,480
they fill out a page on the wiki i send

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,320
an email to the development mailing list

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,880
it goes through a community

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,000
comment period basically and then it

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,080
goes to the fedora

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,240
engineering steering committee or fesco

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,120
for approval

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,679
so it's generally like a two-ish week

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,440
process

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,799
end to end if everything goes well a lot

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,120
of times fesco

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,720
will have questions and they'll want um

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,880
you want clarifications on certain

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,399
things sometimes proposals get rejected

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,480
because there's

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,760
uh you know it's either not good for the

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,919
distribution

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,360
or it's not um not clear enough what the

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,039
the impact is going to be so it's

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,679
basically uh you know go do some more

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,559
homework and come back and fix it

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,320
but then we track the progress of those

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,760
throughout the release cycle and make

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,919
sure

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,120
that things are still on track to make

00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,240
it into the release

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,000
and actually here in a week

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,600
or less than a week i guess is the the

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,799
first checkpoint for that

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,799
where we'll go through and make sure

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,120
things are in a testable state and if

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,720
not

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,039
then they may get dropped to the next

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,039
release

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:18,320
i think it's worth like mentioning that

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,559
at this point we are right now the main

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,360
obstacle for the changer for the

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:25,120
objective

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:27,760
is not counsel nor fasco it's usually

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,600
you're fighting against uh the time or

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,840
resources you need to spend on the

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,559
objective or on the change so

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,320
if you want to change there's literally

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,520
no obstacles other than

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:42,799
uh the commitment you need to do uh

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,880
to make this happen uh

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,480
and to clarify the details so this

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,760
change doesn't break too much but

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,799
uh it's still like there is no

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,760
policy which forbidden you certain chain

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:57,360
to do certain changes uh it's more about

00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,000
are you ready to

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,679
deliver this change and to work on that

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,960
and figure out all the details and

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,440
figure out all the

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,480
obstacles on technical side which may

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:13,440
prevent this change from happening

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:15,120
so it's open

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,559
and i i just think it's a really

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,159
interesting question too

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,200
just in terms of how objectives are kind

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,760
of the vehicle

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,760
one of the many vehicles for how things

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,320
get done in the fedora project

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,559
so whether it's objectives or changes or

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,279
additions or working groups or sigs

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,120
these are all

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,520
just different ways that we get things

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,120
done in fedora but the question that

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,960
usually comes after is like once you

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,320
have these id you know you have an idea

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,200
that you think that oh this could be a

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,840
great

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,840
change or a great um new addition

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,399
proposal something like that

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,159
um the question really comes after is

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,640
what is the community interest and

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,480
engagement around those ideas and well

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,840
what are what are people really

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,000
interested in doing

00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,919
um and the challenge one of the

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,279
challenges with it is it's never a black

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,039
and white process

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,399
and sometimes it's really confusing

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:08,399
because fedora is

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:11,840
pretty good about being first on getting

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:14,799
but we also require freedom first and

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:17,039
we also are considerate of the needs and

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,039
and

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,720
needs and perspectives of our fedora

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,640
friends from all around the world too

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,480
so the thing i think is unique about

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,240
this is the process is very open to

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,320
feedback and i just want to highlight

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,760
some of ben's

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:34,480
somewhat recent improvements to the

00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,559
policy change process and the council

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,399
if you dig into the council docs you can

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,720
actually see that there is a policy on

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,320
how to change policy in the council

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,720
and it's a really interesting window

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:47,200
into um

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,640
kind of how how some of that happens and

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,559
you know as far as the you know the

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,559
question is like how do things

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,080
you know who who may who makes the the

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,760
big decisions like how do these

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,679
how do these big decisions get made in

00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,240
fedora um

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,080
a lot of it is already in the in the

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,120
open in this way and

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,360
i think one thing that's also

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,919
interesting is you know it does

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,640
that that whole idea does depend on the

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,960
idea of

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,519
the meritocracy or that you know where

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,279
it's a very meritocratic approach

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,880
but i think that looking at this at like

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,840
the recent devel discussion

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:22,240
on you know the nano and vim text editor

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,159
change it was just a very interesting

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,919
example to me of how folks were really

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,440
interested in how do we make

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,519
you know even if this isn't the tool

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,799
that everyone everyone wants to use

00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,960
what is a way that we can make our

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,760
default distribution more accessible to

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,000
people

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,880
who are newcomers or people who are new

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,480
to the system

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,080
so um i just i've always really admired

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,840
that about fedora and a lot of the

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,200
things that we don't think about a lot

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,440
but we build on like the four

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,120
foundations even things like the fedora

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,519
project contributor agreement which

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,640
gives

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,519
us a lot of really great flexibility and

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,159
like

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,760
um how our contributions are are trusted

00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,120
to the project i

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,559
kind of rambling now but i just think

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,960
it's a question that's always i've

00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,279
really

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,720
had a lot of interest in fedora and it's

00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,080
really interesting because not a lot of

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,919
folks are doing it

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,200
the way that we're doing it and we're

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,960
we're pretty good at being first at

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,640
these things

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,799
are we ready for a new question

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:21,679
all right what is the fedora silver blue

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,679
status and also status of the other de's

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,760
i only heard half of that question what

00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,880
is the fedora

00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:36,480
silver blue status and also

00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:41,120
the status of the other dees

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:43,600
um so silver blue is still in progress

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,480
you know it's had uh especially i think

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,279
with the

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,480
lenovo thing coming out and silver blue

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,799
wasn't ready for

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,760
that uh the team has been putting a lot

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,159
of work into

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,880
traditional workstation but silver blue

00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,960
is still

00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,679
in progress and i still think it is the

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,320
future um the toolbox command

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,919
that is the um brings up a container

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:07,440
environment for you to work in

00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:09,279
recently reached version 0.1

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,279
it's been rewritten in go and is no

00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:15,279
longer a crazy shell script

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:16,799
so uh uh it's making progress and i

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,279
think the uh more interesting thing is

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,919
good

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,840
thing gonna come from there um i know

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,320
that there was a kde

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,679
version for other of leds of something

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,679
like silver blue called

00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:30,640
kino light um and i don't know the

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,720
status of that

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,840
i think the kitty community was doing

00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,880
that and

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:40,320
wasn't even close to an official

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,960
spin or anything it's just people doing

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,960
it on the side

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,399
from the field uh like silver blue is

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,679
usable on your workstation

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,159
you can do and run you need to get used

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,279
to

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:58,960
the toolbox concept the flatback concept

00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:00,480
and everything uh i know quite a nice

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,760
community around this

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,679
exists so i think you

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,880
just need to try it for yourself and

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,159
take a look if you

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,720
like this approach then join the effort

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,599
and

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:15,599
participate it's definitely usable on

00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:21,839
your daily

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,839
workstation already

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,119
yeah there are just some corner cases

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,720
where um

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,839
like things are not quite worked out yet

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,000
and it's something we don't

00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,760
recommend to the general public quite

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
yet because you have to be

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,919
willing to be like oh i've hit myself

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,200
i've hit a weird corner case i'm going

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:40,639
to have to deal with this

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,480
and that's not the experience we

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:46,399
generally want for people to have with

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:48,800
most of fedora but if somebody says btw

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:52,320
i use arch you can like say i'll raise

00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,320
you one i've got silver blue

00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,159
ready for the next question

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,040
what do you all think about open souza's

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,480
work on creating an independent

00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,800
foundation

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,800
within the context of fedora governance

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,440
oh i've got thoughts but anybody else

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,960
want to go first

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,200
go ahead with your thoughts matt all

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,760
right well so i guess the main thoughts

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,000
are

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,599
uh there are some times when we're

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,160
working through some of the legal things

00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,720
where

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,079
um some independence seems like it would

00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,359
be nice

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,200
i've been told in the past that um

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,720
some of the things that red hat would

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,920
still be concerned about

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:40,079
many of the things that are uh legal um

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,280
liability concerns for red hat even if

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,880
we are an independent

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,400
uh foundation because we take so much

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,440
funding from red hat that our

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,079
independence

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,000
um could be called into question if

00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:55,440
there were something serious to happen

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,200
um so in and i think that actually goes

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,920
to my other part of that which is

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,119
i don't think we are really hampered by

00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,960
our our structure

00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,880
and our independence and getting things

00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:09,440
done um

00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:13,200
and uh hampered by lack of independence

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,560
in that sense um and the only way it

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,680
would really make sense to me

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,480
is if we had at least one and probably

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,079
several

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,040
other major backers with the same kind

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,000
of financial

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:28,000
backing that red hat has to put into it

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,680
otherwise i don't see what a foundation

00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,320
would really be bringing us over where

00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,320
we are now

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,359
back when fedora first came into

00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,400
existence they looked at making a

00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:42,480
foundation

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,839
and it ended up being not very feasible

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,240
because

00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,200
red hat was the primary sponsor and

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,359
there was not

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,960
a bunch of other sponsors in order to

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,160
have that independent board you really

00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,440
need to have

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,240
multiple you know financially multiple

00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,440
in

00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,839
entities financially investing in the

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,359
group

00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:06,880
and without that you get a lot of

00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:08,240
kind of weirdness and yeah and here i

00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,520
should thank our sponsors

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,520
wait i'm sorry

00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:24,480
and here it worked yeah

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,880
so maybe we'll be thanking sponsors in

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,880
the chat

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,400
all right on to the next one what is the

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,359
status

00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,520
of solutions as a goal are there clear

00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:51,839
metrics around building solutions

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:51,839
and targeted experiences for users

00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:59,119
since i'm new i'm uh we'll be first to

00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:02,000
ask is this question reference

00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,720
referencing to something actually

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,320
happened

00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:09,359
in fedora or is it a reference in some

00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:12,640
external notions

00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:15,359
so i think this is referring to um

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,839
from a couple years ago when the council

00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:20,480
met in minneapolis and we you know it's

00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:21,760
basically the idea of not having this

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,480
distinction

00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,839
between spins and labs and just

00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,599
basically

00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,520
you know putting everyone on more equal

00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,480
footing with solutions and the idea

00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,960
being

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,920
that you know we build this kind of base

00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,200
fedora that

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,640
the llama llama herder uh would be a

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,119
solution

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,560
um i would say the answer to that is we

00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,720
haven't really made progress

00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,160
on that other than saying agreeing it's

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,160
a good idea

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,760
just because it's a really big hard

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,880
problem to try and make happen

00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,680
and some of the os builder work that

00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,400
would really

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,400
make it possible um still needs to be

00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,839
done

00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,440
did we get through all the questions

00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:10,560
we're only five minutes

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:15,839
out from the end of the session anyway

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,839
let's get let's get another question

00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,760
dusty says i'm open to have more

00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,200
financial investment in fedora from

00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:29,839
other companies

00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:29,839
take it

00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,800
that was a good comment yeah we are also

00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,920
open for more funding

00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,920
from all those horses

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,920
not just funding i mean brain ideas

00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,880
ideas are cost money as well like you

00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,280
know

00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,960
and bring people to do the work in

00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,800
fedora as well because that's the big

00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,119
investment that red hat really puts in

00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,520
is

00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,520
just a

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,240
a measured in you know tens of millions

00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,640
of dollars

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,240
investment of people time every year

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,839
into the fedora project

00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:17,680
um so that's um

00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:20,000
that's what we'd love to see coming from

00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,520
other companies and we're here for it

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,359
i feel like people have more time on

00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,880
their hands nowadays if you convince

00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:28,000
them

00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:30,240
to get into anything even beyond

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,599
the financial sponsorship aspect one of

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,599
the things that i'd love to just

00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,119
highlight with neil gampa as i see him

00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,040
doing it all the time is just

00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:39,280
opening more bridges and conversations

00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,920
to other communities that are doing

00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,599
similar things and solving similar

00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,119
challenges that we are in the fedora

00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,040
community and trying to bring those

00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,640
conversations together

00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,160
so i'm really hoping that's another

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,319
thing is i'm

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,000
looking forward to is more partnerships

00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:56,079
with other communities even if it's not

00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,560
a

00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,240
uh transaction but just partnerships of

00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,960
of interest and time like

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,920
time is is a super valuable currency in

00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,160
itself right

00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,599
so i think one thing i'm excited for i

00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,880
just want to shout out neil

00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,200
because that's something i see him doing

00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,640
all the time because of

00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,960
fedora uh upstream commitment i think we

00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,079
are

00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:21,520
in a very good position where

00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:23,520
uh we are not competing on the level of

00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,319
distributions as much we are

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,000
actually collaborating with upstream and

00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,200
we are doing our best to support the

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
upstream so

00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,040
it it's not like fedora is doing things

00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,079
for fedora

00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,800
and it's uh fedora is willing to do

00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,000
things for

00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,240
everyone and we are welcome everyone and

00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,119
we also want to help everyone

00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,040
so if you're gentle user it doesn't mean

00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,960
you we cannot work together on some

00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,520
common goal and some interesting tasks

00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,520
so

00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:56,079
that's absolutely a fedora way to

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,960
work together on things beyond the euro

00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,359
distribution

00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,359
alone

00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,560
in that uh that particular i

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,599
encourage a lot of people to that want

00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,720
to do things

00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,640
that you reach any of the people that

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,400
you can know in the joint see or in the

00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,440
marketing team or the design thing or

00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,760
whatever

00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,599
and try to do the stuff i start the

00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,240
podcast without any idea how to do it i

00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,440
just say

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,280
i listen podcast this could be

00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:26,880
interesting and they say okay

00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:29,200
learn how to do it and let's do it like

00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,640
six or seven months ago i say hey i like

00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,319
really i really liking the

00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:36,000
i3 window management manager and

00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,920
what about having something that has

00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,359
pre-installed that window manager and i

00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,400
don't have to rely on the desktop

00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,560
environment

00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,400
and then we have now we have an iso and

00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,920
it's not done by me i just put the idea

00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,359
out there and the people say hey we can

00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,560
do that and they start to work by

00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,400
themselves

00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,640
so we encourage people to try to do the

00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,640
stuff

00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,720
do we have time for one more

00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:06,400
okay sure the status what about the

00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,880
status of mentorship

00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:12,800
and how is mentorship growing how can

00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:16,880
there be more proactive mentorship

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:20,079
this is a big question ask

00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:23,359
the person the op

00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,720
is a mentor as general mentor or

00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:28,000
ambassador mentor because

00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,200
mentors could be a lot of things

00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,839
i think they're meaning general

00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,839
mentorship

00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:38,319
let's see yeah yep

00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,319
i think we had the conversation about it

00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:45,599
just yes

00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:47,599
day before yesterday so that's uh

00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,880
the topic which we definitely think

00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:52,079
about

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:55,280
and uh marie has ideas on

00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,920
uh how this can be worked on so marie

00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,280
can be

00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:02,560
adding something but to what i say but

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,960
i also want to point out the aspect

00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,839
which

00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,880
i was thinking for quite some time but

00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:09,920
uh

00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,480
mentoring uh it is nice as is a

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,200
dedicated program and dedicated mentors

00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:17,680
but

00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:20,720
in fact uh we all as fedora community

00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,800
need to do a little tiny bit of

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:27,040
mentoring here and there

00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:30,160
to help each other to get on on board to

00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:32,480
talk with new users so uh

00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,359
dedicated mentor is a huge amount of

00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,640
work and i

00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:37,680
i tried that for outreachy it's it's a

00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,800
lot of effort

00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:43,920
i wasn't a good one uh definitely

00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:46,079
but uh i would suggest like uh also

00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,200
to everyone in the community to think

00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:49,920
about like

00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,440
can you maybe spend some tiny bit of

00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,960
your time on mentoring

00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:57,200
someone else uh in whatever

00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,119
environment you prefer like whereas like

00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,040
100 social networks right now

00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,560
100 channels you communicate to the

00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,359
world

00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,680
find your own tiny beat and do your job

00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,680
and

00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,280
then marie will talk about the

00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,800
mentorship program

00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:15,839
i have a couple different ideas um

00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,920
definitely part of it is ambassadors and

00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:21,119
looking at that again and how we want to

00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:24,560
mentor new ambassadors and what

00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:27,280
what is an ambassador now in 2020

00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:29,839
and i think it has to do more of that

00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,800
mentorship

00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:33,920
piece right people want uh someone they

00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,520
know there

00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:40,640
so that's very helpful um i'm also an

00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:43,920
outreachy a coordinator slash

00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:45,920
mentor and it is a lot of work but i

00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,880
also find it to be fulfilling so for

00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,560
some people

00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,240
it could be fulfilling and you don't

00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,480
have to be

00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:55,040
a red hat or anyone else to be a

00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,520
outreachy mentor

00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,200
through through fedora that's something

00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,880
anyone can do

00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,319
there is a good amount of time

00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,520
commitment but if it's something you

00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:05,440
care about

00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,000
it works it works well i have to call

00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:11,040
out of course like the join sig

00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,599
do an amazing job of

00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,359
you know reaching these new contributors

00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,599
that's where we send new contributors

00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:19,520
and they connect people and that's been

00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,560
working really effectively

00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,319
uh and yeah even when i was like you

00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,200
know incorporating them in the community

00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,560
outreach

00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,400
so making like even these small

00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,920
additions that no we work perfectly the

00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,240
way we are and i'm like you know what

00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,920
do your things it's a low effort and

00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,920
anyone could hang out in that channel

00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,359
and help people just get to their way

00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,160
there's no meetings

00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:41,760
there's really there's no tech like

00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,359
formal responsibilities that

00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,760
hang out in that channel and direct

00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:48,160
people to the right the right way so

00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,680
um there's a lot of different things

00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,160
that are happening i think it's gonna

00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,920
grow

00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,280
i'd like to i'd like to see the

00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,000
education

00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,680
part grow as far as how to mentor and

00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,640
how to be a good mentor

00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:03,040
just education in general i think can

00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,680
help people with some of the skills

00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,880
that make a good mentor right like

00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:10,560
having some empathy

00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:13,839
and being able to communicate well

00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:15,040
et cetera et cetera so i'll stop talking

00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:17,760
i've been talking for a while someone

00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,760
else can go ahead

00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:23,599
arg the internet also we could be done

00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,119
just to kind of

00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,880
build on that one thing that i always

00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,800
think is interesting that i don't

00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,640
that i always see in fedora but don't

00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,280
necessarily see in other communities

00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:35,839
is specifically in our summer summer

00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:39,119
coding mentored projects community

00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:41,839
um we have this really um

00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,839
long long trend of folks who have been

00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:47,119
students who end up becoming

00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:49,280
mentors and and kind of continuing down

00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,319
not all the time but just you know it's

00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,760
something that it's just a very

00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:53,119
interesting trend to see that i don't

00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,119
necessarily see in a lot of other

00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,480
communities where a lot of times

00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,000
you know the summer ends and then they

00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,359
people go you know people go back to

00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,800
real life but

00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,920
you know i i just always think that's

00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,440
something that's interesting and unique

00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,440
about the fedora community and

00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,640
is also a shout out to the great work

00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,960
with the join sig

00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,280
and also folks like the poll and

00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,599
sumantro who have really championed the

00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,960
mentorship pieces of the mentored

00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,480
projects

00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,000
i think like for some interns that

00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,400
really get to engage you know they get

00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,720
that friends aspect and i know like

00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,319
when i had my internship back in the day

00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,920
and i went to flock for the first time

00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,400
that's why i was sticking around you

00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,680
know

00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,720
i met friends so that's maybe one that's

00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,800
you know one of our

00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:36,079
foundations and keys to success right

00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,079
there with interns

00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,319
yes sumantra is awesome

00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,800
so are we all all done

00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:52,480
people find us if they want to say hi

00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:58,319
after after nest

00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:58,319
after nest uh council fedora council irc

00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:05,599
yeah um

00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,680
you can find me all over mindshare

00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:10,079
design

00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,960
um but our council mailing list is also

00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,319
a

00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,920
good place um definitely

00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:17,200
i think we talked about setting

00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,319
something up on discussion for our

00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,480
project.org but

00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:22,079
um and i don't think that is active

00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,319
right now for us as a group

00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,839
but i'd be interested in that experiment

00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:28,240
at some point

00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:29,040
maybe worth mentioning the fedora social

00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,720
hour

00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:33,040
where you can actually join and

00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:36,240
participate in informal conversation

00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,880
less formal even than here and just have

00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,200
some fun

00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,559
in some members of the council and him

00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:45,440
there and

00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:48,160
yeah you can participate no no need to

00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,359
be shy about it right and we try to do

00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,240
different things

00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:53,520
like we try to mix it up you know trivia

00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,680
pictionary

00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:59,760
mozilla hub so you know we try to make a

00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:01,440
little interactive too

00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,880
all right i have another session to get

00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:07,359
