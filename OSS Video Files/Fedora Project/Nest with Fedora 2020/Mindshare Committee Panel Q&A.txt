00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,000
funniest monster ever

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,000

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,080
all right so let's start talking about

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,520
some of the stuff we've worked on since

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,759
we're not getting questions you might

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,520
have

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,800
it's working or we could just we could

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,160
have our mindshare meeting

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,360
i wednesday nick what's up

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:43,440
can you hear me yes yes yes

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,400
okay i was mean i was my sound was off

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,080
at first

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,160
so you could probably hear me but i

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,759
couldn't hear you

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,560
well welcome welcome please introduce

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,840
you

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,199
yeah introduce me um

00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,479
my name's nick um nb on

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:06,080
irc and like everything

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:09,840
um of course i'm on mindshare

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,960
and i help with packaging

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,400
and infrastructure and

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,720
stuff and ambassadors sometimes and

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,720
stuff

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,599
you talk a little bit about my what my

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,120
chair does so mindshare

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:30,240
has reps from all different parts

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,759
of the mind chair side of fedora

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,639
so marketing we have intern we have

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,319
design and comm ups we have some

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,160
ambassador seats

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,639
so the idea is to bring all these people

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,199
together to kind of have a holistic

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,160
picture

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,800
of what we can kind of do and what the

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,800
status is of the different teams

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,080
and kind of put our heads together and

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,560
be able to

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,160
bring the resources together to do more

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,560
together

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,319
so uh something we would usually be

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,440
doing a lot of

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,639
is looking at proposal for attendance to

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,599
events

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,080
um so we we sponsor people to go to

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,560
events

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,400
normally like pre-covered worlds you

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,879
know if you wanted to go to a conference

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:18,000
and talk about your work with fedora

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,840
we would sponsor you to go do that and

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
help you out with the lodging and all

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,599
that stuff

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,240
that's pretty much for anyone who wants

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,680
to do that we also help folks

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,639
organize local events so whether it be a

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,680
release party

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,680
or you know a fad

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,039
or whatever whatever kind of small event

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,039
you want to do locally

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,719
we give you support for that as well as

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,919
send out swag

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:46,000
so uh what we kind of ask in return for

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,920
those things is a blog post to kind of

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,279
share your experience with

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,720
the community and uh you know to try to

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,519
improve fedora overall

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,959
so that's some of the work we do uh it's

00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,480
been a lot less

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:03,760
in the last couple months because uh

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:07,920
not really traveling or going going very

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,959
far from home these days that was a good

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,040
chunk of what we

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,399
we did but we've actually had a chance

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,640
to focus on

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:19,760
um other topics like the ambassador

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,600
revamp program we spent plenty of time

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,959
talking about ambassadors

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,160
uh in the mindshare committee meetings

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,800
and um you know that actually went

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,560
somewhere

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,800
this time so pretty excited about that

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,240
um i'm just kind of talking if someone

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,839
else wants to pick up

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,160
what else what other kinds of stuff do

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,160
we do

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,160
we have so diverse people everyone does

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,920
a lot of things

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,519
but then there are seats what they are

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,600
focused on i could talk about ci but

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,600
that's not why i'm in minds here so

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,760
i'm not going to talk about that uh yes

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,279
sumatra has mentioned we help a lot with

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,440
minted projects

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,200
uh samantha and murray do a lot of

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,720
things around there somehow i ended up

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,480
here i don't know how

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,399
uh there's g-shock there is outreachy we

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,240
also had gci which google uh stopped

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,880
doing it from this year

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,240
and one of the focus that well i want to

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,360
work on i'm not saying how much i have

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,839
been working on because

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,600
it's been hard recently but our focus

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,279
should be how much of the impact those

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,120
projects how much do we need those

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,040
projects how much does community want it

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,880
instead of just having projects

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,120
i know it can be controversial to say

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:37,519
but i'm not exactly 100 sure that

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:40,160
all our projects are very much

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,079
okay as i said controversial right

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,320
hundred percent of the things are 100

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,000
utilize but i guess this never is

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,600
so but increasing the optimization of

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,040
the projects that we have and how much

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,079
we can

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,760
uh utilize use it for the best uh

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,279
contributor sustainability is one of the

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,079
things that we have been trying to work

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,399
with

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,079
uh it's not just mental project interns

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,440
but more of it as we said

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:07,680
ambassadors like the people who

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,839
do a lot of outreach a lot of work for

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,800
fedora

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,600
who are a pillar of fedora so how do we

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,160
keep them happy

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,160
sustained that's also i see a

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,560
responsibility of mindset

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,839
so things that fresco does not do which

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,640
is other than

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,320
engineering thing at some point i

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,440
somewhere i see that it should be done

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,040
by mindshare which is community

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,040
how do we make community happy and how

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,760
do we make sure that they

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,959
they are respected here they are wanted

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,560
and they feel good and then

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,079
they are sustained as in sustained

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,959
contribution they feel as a family and

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,480
not just

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,000
workers that we have often discussed on

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,760
different tickets

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,320
and there's kind of lines of

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,360
communication lines of communication

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,639
really important part of it and we do

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,000
try to improve that like communication

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,560
and how we do the different

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,519
processes so that things don't fall

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,800
through the cracks

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,519
as well well when

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,560
my shirt starts like i don't know it's

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,639
been too long i think

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,240
it's two years ago probably nick

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,279
probably more like two or three years

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,480
ago

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,079
and the main idea was that the

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,440
non-technical um

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:22,839
part of fedora were totally disconnected

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,760
so marketing ambassadors design

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,760
um

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,839
at the time that this part everything is

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:34,399
part of ambassadors

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:36,880
they were like um iceland so

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,440
now the idea of mention was to try to

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:43,200
have a communication board that

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,639
serves to be a bridge between the teams

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,959
and between the technical parts of the

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,320
team

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:51,600
because um a huge

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,240
problem that was in in first times

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,079
was that we have people that are

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,279
supposed to be marketing and supposed to

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,800
be ambassadors to be

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,320
supposed to be the face of fedora but

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,000
they don't know what is

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,680
happening in the technical part so how

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,959
can you promote an operative system if

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,120
you don't know what is inside

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,480
so that that was the first ideas that

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,760
came with uh

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,760
with my short team

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,760
that seems like a pretty good overview

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,920
of

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,120
the different things that we do we also

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,600
look at like

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,639
some policy type things that have to do

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,000
with

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,519
the mind chair side of fedora so

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,680
you know looking at like change

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,399
proposals like how do we deal with that

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,560
for

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,600
community related things there's no

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,120
formal process

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,360
there um helping

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,279
or trying to kind of formulate how we're

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,720
gonna go from in-person events

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:52,639
to online or virtual events you know

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,639
will probably be the ones to kind of

00:13:52,639 --> 00:14:00,320
work up a process for happen um

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,800
so uh yeah that's

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,680
that's a good summary of all the stuff

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,680
we work on right

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,040
is it enough i just want to say because

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,320
he's not here

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,160
and he does a lot of work around

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,079
documentation so i guess that's also one

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,680
of our main focus that they are

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,279
indexed they are easy to reach they are

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,120
updated and those things

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,720
we have yet to come up with strategy or

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,000
at least from what i see and from what i

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,839
understand we have yet to see

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,600
a strategy that incomes all of these

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,519
things but as definitely one of the

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,480
things that mindset would want to look

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,079
at

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,880
since there are no questions i have one

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,720
question for edward and nick and

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,000
probably alberto who have been on

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,079
mindset for a longer time

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,480
have you seen any change or involvement

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,800
in what mindshare was

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,000
made to do and now what it is trying to

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:51,920
do do you see any involvement in their

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:56,720
evolution of our goal vision

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:58,560
sure sure and when we started we have um

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,880
well there is a known problem with

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:04,720
ambassador for a long long time

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:09,120
and i think that the

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:11,519
the current proposal is uh

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,560
long-term work we are working in this

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,560
like for

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,560
the beginning of the mindshare committee

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,519
and people was expecting that we work on

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,639
that but it's a

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,440
so hard topic that it takes too much

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,680
time

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,360
but now we have um solid proposals so

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,560
for me that's evolution that's the world

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,880
being

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,800
reflected in actions not only in

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,920
meetings not only in words not only in

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,560
emails or

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,480
or meetings or irc channels it's just

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,000
it's work that is being done

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,839
and hopefully we have tons of people

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,440
who wanted to collaborate in this uh

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,480
proposal we have

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,920
i think two um excellent

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,800
uh people that is uh that are will be

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,839
driving the

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,079
the initiative that are sumantro and

00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,519
mariana

00:15:54,079 --> 00:16:00,720
and hopefully uh we are going to be

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,959
this uh this war is going to be more

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,759
visible to the people now that we have

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,480
action meetings it's going beyond the

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,360
the a lot of

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,839
meetings or words that have been written

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,839
about it

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,040
i still have also my problem with

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,279
marketing that is nobody else in my team

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,279
but

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,880
alberto wants to be part of the team

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,480
yeah but better leave my team for

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,480
comments

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,639
[Laughter]

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,959
i agree and you know what would be

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,680
really kind of interesting to do as we

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:44,320
do this

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:47,680
um the ambassador revamp is to just like

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,320
really like document how we do those

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,000
changes

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,920
well because if it if it

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,360
i mean eventually it will be success

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,279
right so there's always going to be some

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,920
failures

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,560
and just kind of documenting how that

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,880
goes

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,000
and sharing that process because i think

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,480
that

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,039
something like a program dying out is

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,079
somewhat

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,559
natural if it doesn't evolve right

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,760
so how do you revive those kinds of

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,199
programs

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,120
i mean when we think about something

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,280
like marketing

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,199
um i do think like i've heard these

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,760
stories about like the good old days and

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,160
tatika might be able to tell me more but

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,559
like didn't the design team used to be

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,000
up in the irc channels like every day

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,280
chatting and

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,640
working on stuff all the time

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:39,440
you know everything went to

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,880
into a more complicated set and they

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,039
decided to have

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,960
several channels for the same thing and

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,880
several boards for the same thing and

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,400
several groups for the same thing

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,960
so it is true that if you divide you can

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,799
conquer

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,000
but that doesn't apply to everything and

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,000
i think that it was a mistake

00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,200
it was a mistake

00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,639
[Music]

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,679
uh so instead just trying to keep

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,320
dividing we should

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,440
probably just try to take a look of

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,480
everything that we have

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,960
currently and see which one of those we

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,160
can

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:25,360
either merge or make it work together

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:29,840
uh in a better way more more smoothly

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,360
it the idea is to work as a bridge

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,799
sometimes we will have to merge

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,880
sometimes we will have to separate

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,919
because they are going to argue

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,880
but the idea is that manchester try to

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,080
focalize

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:45,039
why there is people willing to help

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,039
but it's too divided

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:54,080
nice um

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,600
so there's this my cat's

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,440
she's not around right now i would

00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,080
totally bring her on screen

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,320
so there's this idea uh you know that if

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,440
you're working on

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:08,559
if the team is working on like 20 things

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,720
or one thing they're gonna deliver

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,720
20 times as quickly or 20 times as

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,600
slowly as if they're working on one

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,640
thing

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,200
so i think we're all like a group of

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,080
people with ideas right

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,200
and part of what calculator works is if

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:28,400
you have an idea you do it

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,120
but when it when it comes to community

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,400
stuff

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,120
it involves other people you can't just

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,120
make

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,320
decisions unilaterally and you're trying

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,400
to get

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,400
people on board with these plans right

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,280
and you're just having these

00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,960
conversations and they're

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,200
they're just going on and on in the

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,280
ticket and then it kind of just dies off

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:51,200
and nothing happens right

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,760
so i think a nice evolution of mindshare

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,400
would be

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,799
maybe less of that and more like we're

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,480
just going to focus on this one thing

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,080
and make it happen and that's what i've

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,039
been trying to do

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,640
a bit with the team and even trying to

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,720
say like okay these people are working

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,320
on this like let's not distract them and

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,520
take them off of that

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:16,960
um and assign them more work you know so

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,919
thinking about using your resources well

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,640
to accomplish

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,120
one awesome thing together create that

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,120
sustainably and move on to the next

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,799
so i think we have a tent we do have a

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,000
tendency to like go all over the place

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,360
with our ideas

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,280
because we have a ton of them i have a

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,480
ton of them

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,880
yeah i know the feeling because when

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,000
i have i'm working with a i3 is being

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,159
now

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,159
but i didn't want to start the world now

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,000
because i was trying to focus myself in

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,600
the podcast

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,039
but there was a lot of people that say

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,200
hey you have the idea but

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,400
purity tells out there so say okay i'm

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,760
going to put out there but i'm not

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,960
working on them

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,880
if you're going to do the work i would

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,840
be happy to create the structure and

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,760
happily

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,799
and us here that is in the chat right

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,960
now step ah

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,960
with

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,280
yeah let's just go with dan

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,200
he works in the packaging of the i3

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,480
package

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,840
and my work will be just like gather the

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,039
people together

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,520
but i wasn't able to to work more

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:36,559
further than that because i was focusing

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,559
myself in the podcast

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,760
yeah i hear you there are so many things

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,799
that

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,720
i thought to try or i had in mind but

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,159
then again like work is there plus you

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,559
have some other thing

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,919
one of the small thing how do you fedora

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,640
the magazine post and i was very

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,760
interested in

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:57,120
uh restarting it i took up the job

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,240
uh some i started saying some threads i

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,280
got great response

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,960
we had answers but lack of time

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,240
and also when you are doing it when very

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,080
tired the sentences and the

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,600
documentation don't come as you would

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,080
want them to

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,360
but then thankfully we had fedora join

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,360
just like we got in received

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:19,280
from federer i joined for i3 and

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,200
other a bunch of different places uh

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,400
two people from federal joint came

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,159
forward and they are helping me and

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,520
they're doing amazing job

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,120
to a point where i said you know what

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,320
i'm just going to introduce you to these

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,919
people who i think are

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,320
great candidates of course you can have

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,080
your own and you should be the editor of

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,520
this i don't even need access to those

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,400
parts because you are doing most of the

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,720
job

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,440
so it's also you know these initiatives

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,760
they may not end up but if you try to

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,640
share it with people like everybody

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,760
everybody you did

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,039
and then i did with how do you fedora

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,360
this has turned out pretty well and i'm

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:55,039
really excited about those things

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,880
so taking initiative of i think another

00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:00,000
part of the evolution of

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,159
what we're do like what we're doing here

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,080
as a as a mind share committee and how

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,799
we take care of our teams and stuff like

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,840
that

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:10,720
is looking into those like hey what is

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:13,679
your capacity actually

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,559
um and how much like can you do checking

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,880
in with people

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,159
to make sure you know your fellow

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,240
contributor

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,080
i have i'm doing check-ins with the

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,640
co-leads and i made them really aware

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,400
like

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,600
you're forgetting to feel like it's too

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,760
much let's handle this

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,360
let's handle this early and i've been

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,440
having the same kind of conversations

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,480
with the dni team too

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,440
because as contributors

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,720
especially in these parts of the fedora

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,720
community

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,760
burnout can happen kind of quickly

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,679
because you have one

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:51,279
two-person teams right so

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:53,039
we got to be careful with ourselves

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,320
and the rest of our things we want to do

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,000
in life like

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,240
viple i don't want to hear stories about

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,200
how you can't write docs because you're

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,200
so exhausted

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,279
like but it's it's happening so we gotta

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,919
figure out

00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,120
like we want we want you to be enjoying

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,159
that time that you're

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,960
you're spending on working on fedora

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,799
unless you really like being like strung

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,679
out with work being miserable yeah

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,039
that's one of my hobby and

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,279
i keep getting back to it for some

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:28,159
reason you know

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,840
a lot of us are workaholics here i think

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,320
that the magazine does

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,360
i that i think is it can be really

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,400
productive

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,919
for all the teams not only for myself

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,440
but for all the teams

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:43,200
and they have um they have a template

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,039
but we cannot create we can create it

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,559
maybe in a poker instance i don't know

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,720
that you can fit or ideas

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,159
what just what idea do you have that

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,919
people can say okay i don't have any

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,799
idea but i have time to spare so

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,159
let me see what people have in on their

00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,080
minds

00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,360
that's totally okay i think we can

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,400
gather loves of

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,960
people thinkings about what can be done

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,240
what can we be include or what can be an

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,640
extra not necessarily

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,520
inside the the os but inside the

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,600
community

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,880
that stuff that we can do for example i

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,440
thought i think

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,000
uh at some point i say hey we can gather

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,200
some

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,720
kind of federalized stories and

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,720
like one month after uh

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,799
i don't remember how how was the name of

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,520
that guy had started a series called how

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,520
do you fedora on the magazine

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,279
and and it's all sadly like that i say

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,400
hey we killed other people not

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,120
necessarily

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,080
um developers inside the community but

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,919
normally users

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,440
how do you figure out how you use fedora

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:45,039
on your daily

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:48,320
in your daily life and i think it was a

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,520
a very big um series of articles in the

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,240
magazine so

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,360
we can put ideas in in kind of a board

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,400
where people can just

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,039
grab an idea and try to work on it maybe

00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,360
i don't know

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,840
it's something that came to my mind

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,840
sometimes

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:08,799
uh so ashlyn asks about mentorship

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:12,159
uh do you mean the mental project

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:14,159
so ashland so fedora participates in a

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,080
couple programs so i'll talk about

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,960
one first and then the book can take

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,039
over so i coordinate for outreachy

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,159
and i can actually just drop a link in

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,640
there so

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,000
um fedora usually does a couple

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,440
outreachy interns

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,200
in a summer and this is a program

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:35,200
specifically

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:39,760
geared towards women

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:41,200
um black and african american hispanic

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,679
native american

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,039
um people who are facing discrimination

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,720
for gender

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:51,279
et cetera in their home country so

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,480
uh we usually have three or four slots

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,400
of summer and

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,840
they're they're on different topics

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,600
mostly technical

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,960
but occasionally we will do something

00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,440
different like the summer we had a

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,559
design

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:06,320
internship um

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:08,480
and those run 12 weeks it's key

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,679
and it's a pretty cool program it's how

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,679
i got involved with fedora

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:20,480
uh sumatra you can ask

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,200
to join so show do you want to talk

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,480
about um

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,399
google summer code a little bit sure so

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,960
google summer of code is a program by

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:30,799
google

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:34,000
where it pays organizations

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,760
to encourage students to participate in

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,039
open source and do a live project for

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,520
three months it's very much like

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,559
internship with the organization which

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,320
google

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,080
takes care of the financial side of

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,440
things or the portals on

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,399
or how you interact or organizations

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,279
come up with

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,840
let me add some mantra so there we go i

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,600
have friends

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,279
organizations and different community

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,799
members come up with projects

00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,760
and usually g-shock or guidance as we

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,279
are called sumatra

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:08,480
is an organ was doing a lot of

00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:12,799
great things earlier organ means except

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,799
i accepted him but i guess

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,720
i thought i accepted him i don't know

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,159
why

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,159
i think all of us accepted him

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,760
that's how we welcome you so mantra you

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,760
should know so

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,559
we go through the projects and we see if

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,200
it fits the project whereas in fedora

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,399
project

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,480
and if it fits what gsoc is trying to do

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,399
unlike outreachy so that's what the

00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,399
difference is outreach is focused

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,159
towards diverse thing and

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,559
to provide a bunch of things for project

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,880
not just code google summer of

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,919
code as we know it's very much focused

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,760
on code where you

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,440
work on a project and you try to

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,360
contribute in the

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,799
coding manner as much as possible so we

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,000
see if it fits the organization's

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,080
missions and goals

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,320
and then we see if they are eligible for

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,799
g-shock and then we take them

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,720
we apply them and then google sees

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,480
google also has bunch of policies to

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,000
identify how these projects if they're

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,080
suitable or not

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,919
and once we have them we accept students

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,200
out of multiples and hundreds and

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,919
hundreds of proposals for

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,799
sometimes one project depending on how

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,919
easy how

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:25,360
like if there is a website related

00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,799
project it would be very famous because

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,600
there are a lot of students getting into

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,840
those things

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,440
so depending on what the project is they

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,360
get bunch of proposals and mentors

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,080
select which student they feel

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,840
is the most suitable to finish the

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,440
project in time

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,360
and then once they do there are three

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,279
evaluation periods first second and

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,679
third is the final one

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:48,000
and they get paid from google and

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:51,039
federer gets to encourage

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,120
some very great talent from universities

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,880
to participate and work on open source

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,679
without thinking of things like okay i

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,200
have

00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,720
yet another problem i would like to do

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,240
internship and

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,000
different things and definitely big

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,120
organization names and google's

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,919
google's name count a lot so gsoc

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,520
has a lot of things going about it and

00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,000
there are some great things in outreach

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,520
which is expanding the horizon and not

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,559
just focused on code because we all know

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,039
it's not just code

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,640
which makes a project successful so

00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:23,520
these two

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:26,559
are great things

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:29,520
so we have these formal programs that we

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:31,360
are part of but there's informal

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:36,559
mentorship

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:39,840
going all over the project you know

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:41,360
like you join a channel you ask a

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,279
question here or there

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,399
can slowly build a relationship with

00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,760
some people

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:49,360
um and a a session like or an event like

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,080
this you can connect with someone a bit

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,039
more

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,559
and potentially they can help you kind

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,000
of navigate some

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,240
problems it would be cool to have some

00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,720
kind of like buddy system

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,320
for fedora uh where you can just ask you

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,000
know like you just when you're new to a

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,080
place and they're like i know this is

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,480
probably a dumb question but i need to

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,679
ask

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,799
but um you know you have that place and

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,960
that's what was always

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,640
that was great about having a mentor

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,159
myself when i first started you can just

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,799
go to that person and be like i don't

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,640
understand

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:23,039
i've never looked at this before so um

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,399
now that gci actually we're looking at

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:28,640
google

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:30,320
docs um as a potential but we actually

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,760
applied to that

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,519
not work out for the last round yeah and

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,960
uh i would just like to extend this

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,120
invitation if you

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,760
think of a program that's great and

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,399
that's also offers a bit of

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,919
outside of just coding abilities do

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,039
reach out to us i would like to know

00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,279
more about the different

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,720
programs that we can participate in it's

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,679
definitely one of the things that i'd be

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,000
interested to look at

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,320
so niharika should if you have something

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,320
in mind

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:04,080
i have a question that from the last uh

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,000
i mean the last vlog i guess was the

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:09,519
dresden one

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:13,039
was the only one that happened but

00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:14,960
i met the interns that we haven't

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,320
i don't remember it was origin i think

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,760
it was overreaching that we're happy

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,440
working in the

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,720
in the happy net packets version for

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:26,240
fedora appreciation week

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:29,120
uh but i my question is

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,519
they work something inside our project

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,640
our

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:35,200
the fedora community but we have

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,440
some kind of retention policy for these

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,399
guys that apply

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,080
or they uh just have i mean it's not

00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:45,120
super okay that we work there

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:48,080
we help them to to make their

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,559
their study their internship to this

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:54,240
college but

00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:56,399
our the thing that we have from them is

00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,200
just the product they develop maybe dogs

00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,640
or maybe

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,320
an application there is no other

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,960
obligation after that

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,480
or there is a way that we can reach them

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,559
or try to help them to

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,559
incorporate in other teams to help

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,399
yes so as i said you know that's one

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,559
other thing that i have discussed

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,720
greatly some of the frustration about

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,399
one of the thing that i have noticed is

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,880
often the infra side of team

00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,440
nick and nick would understand infra

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,159
team

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,840
is not informed of what g-stock or

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,360
outreach inventors are working on

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,000
thankfully we don't have those problems

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,440
now and then at the last moment they go

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,559
to infrastructure and say that hey we

00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,799
need this thing hosted

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,159
and then like well you didn't you never

00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,960
informed us

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,799
we need to fix those parts we need to

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,360
make sure that communication is proper

00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,360
and

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,600
as i said you know who wants this

00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,720
project and how much value does it add

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:51,760
it's not just about having a project and

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:54,720
that's one of the things sorry

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,559
no please be good it'll be nice whenever

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,840
communa shift gets

00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:03,600
um set back up uh well

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,600
we all know communion shift has

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,320
ea chances of coming back right gdpr i'm

00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:14,079
i won't have my hopes very high on that

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:17,040
but let's see how that goes

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,679
yeah because i i think i didn't realize

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,879
there was

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,639
gdpr implications i thought it was that

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:26,960
they were waiting on

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:29,359
someone to set up the rdu data center

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,280
that's that's there but i'm just looking

00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:34,639
at this other part as well and

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,599
if you attended cpe uh

00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,359
the quiz pub quiz thing that we set up

00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,280
in that one other thing was the original

00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,240
idea of community shift was that we gave

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,720
you

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,040
a place where you can do stuff with your

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,720
project and you get to experience and

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,240
experiment and try to play around with

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,480
different federal projects and that can

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,280
be

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,560
in future integrated in these things so

00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,000
coming shifts

00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,359
goal has been narrowed down there is

00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,280
obviously coming your shift and i think

00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:02,960
it will come back soon

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:06,640
but yeah we've also been doing is

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:10,160
creating some aws instances

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:12,720
yes if someone wants to host something

00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,680
um a lot of times the answer ends up

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,599
being

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:20,400
okay we're not maintaining it but

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,760
we'll give you a server to go have fun

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,680
with

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,599
yeah and that's uh again a

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,839
sustainability part comes in picture

00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,920
uh like you can just develop this

00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,160
project but you also need to take care

00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,680
of

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,280
it as it's your project and then form a

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,400
community around it it's not just about

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,960
coding and

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,480
because we all know one person at one

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,520
point failure is never good in any

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,200
scenario

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,000
so it should not just be maintained the

00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,079
student but they should also like

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,320
our summer projects or maintain projects

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,920
i should say should focus more on

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,480
getting more people involved there

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,160
rather than just mentee working on it

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,599
there are definitely things that i have

00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,520
in mind and there are

00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,800
i get great feedbacks on how we can do

00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,240
things better

00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,810
but would be interesting to see how we

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,000
do it and

00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:04,720
[Music]

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,520
well there's a mindset seat has just

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:13,839
started

00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:13,839
yeah fermented projects let's see

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:23,599
yes uh you can join on fedora hyphen

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,720
join on irc or at join fedora

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:29,520
i mean on telegram i have a doubt

00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,520
more like um

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:36,480
i don't know a fire started as usual

00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:38,800
but in the past years

00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,160
i mean the recent years a huge

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,599
difference that i have seen

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:47,040
from what this were

00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,440
done on my time uh i see that there is a

00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,880
lot of

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:54,560
interest on the external official

00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:57,440
uh projects for interns

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,400
why are you laughing you're thinking of

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,599
something that

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,960
we discussed before

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:07,280
but what about the fedora

00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,280
um

00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:16,960
it's paraphrasing my myself but

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:19,359
it seems that you know if i were in my

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,000
old house i wouldn't have all this sort

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:23,760
of

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,800
customs and and anyway

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,320
so just should it should it need to know

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:32,640
what you're feeling

00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,640
it's hard i'm afraid with this

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:39,440
okay so there is this

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,119
real concern first when they finish

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,760
their projects either if the

00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,119
the outreach is google server what

00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,880
happens there

00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:51,760
so if we still click hang into

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,200
those external projects instead of

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,920
trying to

00:37:53,200 --> 00:38:00,320
either make our own or try to facilitate

00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:03,200
a more easy interaction

00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,079
from you're just doing a project into

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,040
your

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,720
joining the project then you know these

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,720
people that comes in to help

00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,880
for a couple of months or half a year or

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,160
one year then they're going to disappear

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,800
and then we're going to end with the

00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:20,079
same issue that we're not having

00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:23,440
recurring and long-term contributors

00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:26,560
seriously guys you're not helping

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:29,920
i have ideas sorry

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,980
this guy i see them i'm ignoring it

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,440
i have ideas though

00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,520
[Music]

00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,960
listen eduard always brings the party we

00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,440
knew that

00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,040
that's what he does for the social hour

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,200
but um

00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,880
[Music]

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:48,079
my idea my real my thought about this

00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:51,280
is that it comes from the mentors

00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:53,200
right so it's about the mentors

00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,280
getting maybe some more education and

00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:58,240
resources on how

00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,359
to be a good mentor and to get in the

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,400
mindset of that

00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:05,200
like from my experience with

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,400
mismo to my experience now having an

00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,800
intern

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,560
i'm like looking at that you know the in

00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,920
the intern that i'm working with right

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,280
now is like

00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,680
you know this is like the beginning of

00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,480
like a fedora friendship

00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,599
right like it's not just i'm schooling a

00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,560
newbie

00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,599
or whatever like this is someone that i

00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,599
care about their

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,520
development i care about their

00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,640
fulfillment and

00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:34,160
participation in this project so

00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:38,800
there's definitely teachable skills

00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:41,760
that mentors can get and improve upon

00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,760
to make that more long-term like if i

00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,359
think about my relationship with mismo

00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,240
she was always there

00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,280
encouraging me to stay involved to

00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,440
participate

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,200
reminding me of events like you should

00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,640
submit for flock or

00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,880
whatever it might be or hey

00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:01,359
i'm you know i'm not even gonna try to

00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,160
hi a recommendation letter to become the

00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,440
f cake

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,640
like this is how this is how far my

00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,440
mentor

00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,000
has stayed with me because at this point

00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,599
she's my

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,720
friend right so i really think

00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:19,520
like mentorship if it's in its

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,040
full capacity i mean that's what it

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,720
looks like for me

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,240
it might be different for somebody else

00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,359
and i totally understand that

00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:30,240
but there's definitely a mindset

00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:31,200
a mindset going into it and there's

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,599
specific

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,599
ways that you can encourage your mentees

00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:41,280
and i honestly think it was like

00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,880
example being like a woman having a

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,240
woman mentor

00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,920
was like great for me you know i needed

00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,200
to have someone that i could talk to

00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,280
about

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,680
the fact that it's there's like no women

00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,839
here

00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,440
just the different weird situations you

00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,680
get into socially

00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,839
like you know standing in in a

00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,760
conversation of like 12 15 people and

00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:06,160
you're literally the only woman

00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,839
it's like someone just talked to you

00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,480
about like that situation

00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:12,240
right or um someone just kind of give

00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,760
you encouragement to stand up in front

00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,800
of a room full of

00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:19,359
dudes whatever it might be um so that's

00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,839
kind of how i feel about mentorship

00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,720
and what we could do better in keeping

00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,920
the mentees

00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,040
retained and and and involved in

00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,560
communities

00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,200
engaging them as friends what if we do

00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:36,000
like a

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:39,839
summer camp for mentors nice

00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,880
all right open a ticket practica

00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:47,040
human something i mean because

00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,040
if the issue is that mentors only

00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:51,520
they only stay with the project when

00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,680
this happening and what happens after

00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,599
i had the same experience with nismo i

00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,040
mean she was i had

00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,640
even questions about my daily work

00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,839
that had nothing to do with fedora and

00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,839
she was there

00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,200
um so yeah maybe if we teach people that

00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,800
we are here

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,359
because we are in a community that's

00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,480
that's what i that's what i want to say

00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:18,240
it's not just having

00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,640
a project that you have to fulfill like

00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,319
a task because sometimes it feels that

00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,640
google summer code and all that

00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:26,000
feels like a task you're doing a job

00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,119
because you have a deadline

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,079
and all that so it's trying to retrieve

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,520
all the fun

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,200
so you don't feel that you're doing the

00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,640
job you're doing it because you just

00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,599
like

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,839
now the other product that comes with it

00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,680
is

00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,960
what happens when you actually like it

00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,920
and it's the

00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,760
really high burnout rate that we have

00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,160
what happens on the long term

00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,119
was that you know that you like it but

00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,000
you feel that it's

00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:53,680
getting into a work site again so it's

00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,520
it's actually trying to get a balance

00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,400
between the newcomers who doesn't feel

00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,800
that

00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,560
that it is fun because it's just

00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,480
responsibility because there are

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,400
deadlines and they're news and there is

00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,280
a lot of knowledge and there's a lot of

00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,760
people

00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,400
but there is the other side of that of

00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,359
that side

00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,800
of that table so there is these people

00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:15,280
who are already

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,880
being for several years they know that

00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,960
they are good at it they

00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,480
they have grown not just personally but

00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,240
also professionally

00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,760
and they just got tired because there is

00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,440
no help so

00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,960
if the mentors are the ones in the

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,040
middle then

00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,720
it's not about getting new people it's

00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,359
not about retaining old people it's

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,240
about

00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,920
having those mentors to both words and a

00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:40,480
good mind

00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:42,240
mindset well you know

00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,839
and i think looking at it as a

00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,359
friendship or like a

00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,880
relationship you're having with the

00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:49,200
mentee mentor

00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,040
like it changes it reframes it a little

00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,760
bit from work

00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,839
to something a little bit closer to your

00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,640
heart maybe

00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:59,200
not to get yourself helps a lot when you

00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,599
have the

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,720
uh you have a previous relationship with

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,720
your mentor

00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,560
like it was my case with statica when i

00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,839
entered the project

00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:12,880
i don't know we have met like

00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:14,560
seven years before i started the project

00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,920
something like that

00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:20,480
i even took your wedding dress so yeah

00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,839
so i don't know it's way too much time

00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,839
to count

00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,480
and i asked tatika for a lot of stuff

00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:31,520
not necessarily inside the fedora

00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,079
project we are friends from forever for

00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,720
personal reason i met his husband she

00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:39,599
met my wife uh

00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,920
also i i'm pretty sure that tatika

00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,760
doesn't meet my song in person but a lot

00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,520
of pictures

00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,440
tatika was the photographer of my

00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,480
wedding um

00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:53,680
it was my first wedding ever so

00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:56,880
that's a long time long time long time

00:44:53,680 --> 00:45:00,800
yeah so that helped a lot when you are

00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,640
in in when you're being a mentee because

00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,000
uh you have respect for the person that

00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,040
is mentoring you so you

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,319
you know what they are talking to you

00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:13,200
in the best interest of you okay

00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:13,760
so that helps a lot in the in the that

00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,240
trust

00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,560
that you can have with the mentor is

00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:21,119
need to be built to be a a great

00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,119
mentoree

00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:31,839
cool well we made it to the end of the

00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:31,839
