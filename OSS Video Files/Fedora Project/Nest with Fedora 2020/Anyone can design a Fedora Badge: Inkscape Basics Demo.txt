uh with fedora and i'm a part of the

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,280
design team

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,119
marie norden the eff cake is my mentor

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,119
so this talk is going to be about

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,520
designing fedora

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,400
badges and escape and i'm going to start

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,599
with a demo

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,760
where i'll design a badge and share some

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,960
text that i've picked up in the last

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,279
five months

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,960
so this talk is for anyone who is

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,040
interested in design

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,040
contributing to the badges team or

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,079
learning about inkscape

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:44,000
i will also be conducting a hands-on

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:47,440
batches design workshop in about

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,480
four four hours so if after this talk

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,280
you would like to

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,719
test drive your learnings do join me for

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,039
the workshop

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,120
if you have any questions feel free to

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,920
ask them in the chat box

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,120
uh i don't think there is a notification

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,320
but i will

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,760
keep on checking it periodically

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,880
okay so let's start oh

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,840
hi shraddha hi everyone

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,840
i'm just gonna

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,320
share my screen and

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:26,640
for a moment i think yep

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:30,079
there we go so you can double click here

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,439
to maximize this video

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:36,560
so that this area is in focus

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,560
right okay so what we are going to do

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,119
today for the purpose of this demo

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:46,079
we are going to design an events badge

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,159
so with specifically designing a batch

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,399
that all of you will get we're going to

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,439
design the nest with fedora attendee

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,520
batch

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,119
so the first thing we'll do is we'll set

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,200
up the environment and collect all the

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,840
resources we need

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,439
right so the first thing you do when

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,880
you're making a batch is you download

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,280
the template

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,399
and this is the badges website and you

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,399
can go here

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,800
and look at all the previous badges

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,640
so i'm going to talk more about this

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,440
website in my workshop later so if

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,959
you're interested to join me there

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,840
right so i'm just going to visit the

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,840
badge index

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,280
okay so here you can see there are

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,680
different types of badges

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,640
and today we're going to do an event

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,239
patch so

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,319
i'm going to scroll down to the event

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,720
category

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,800
i'm gonna download a template from here

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,680
so i'm gonna going to use an existing

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,239
badge

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,920
and modify the artwork so that we can

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,599
use it for the

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,280
badge i would suggest using a badge that

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,760
is pretty

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,040
new so that you know the design is up to

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,840
date and

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,760
there's a higher chance you will find

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,879
the svg

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,920
so let's see

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:11,760
i'm gonna use this the

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,280
ohio linux fest 2019 since this is 2019

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,640
it's pretty recent

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:20,080
um you can use this one also if you want

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,519
this i think this uh this one was made

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,040
in the past two or three months

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,280
so this is also pretty easy i'm going to

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:32,959
use this one and

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:35,680
if you click on the badge

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,159
so this will open the batch details and

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,879
if you

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,480
go to the ticket you can download the

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,720
svgs from here

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,840
i will do this in detail in the workshop

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,879
so

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,319
uh right now i'm just i

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,920
have it here right so i've already

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,480
downloaded it

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,120
and after you open the svg this is

00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,319
inkscape i've opened it in inkscape

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,439
for those of you who don't know and this

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,480
is what it looks like when it

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:08,400
when it's open okay i'm gonna check

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:11,599
if there are any messages

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,599
oh hi everyone okay

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:18,639
great so

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,400
so the first thing we do um

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,160
when we're designing a badge is we'll

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,759
set up a palette

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,040
so if you have if you have not set up a

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,639
fedora palette

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,080
this is not what you're going to see by

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,720
default

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,360
by default this is the palette you're

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
going to see

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,400
so if you're going to be designing

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,360
batches it's important that you set up

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,680
the palette

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,360
it's easier for you that way and it

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,160
ensures that all the badges that are

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,360
made

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,479
have a consistent site style so

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,360
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,560
set up the palette

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:56,160
so i'm just going to go to this url

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,600
this is the

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,400
box project so the docs for the

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,600
badges project so you will find all the

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,080
resources you need

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,960
right here uh if you don't have inkscape

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,160
you can install

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,120
inkscape uh here are the links so right

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,160
now we're going to

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,680
download the palettes right

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,960
so if you click on this this is the

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,000
basic color palette which is the

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,120
requirement so

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,840
this is the gpl file you'll see

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,600
a bunch of hex codes here and these are

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,919
the rgb values

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,960
so to download this so this is a

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,880
palette file

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,479
so download to download this just right

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,400
click

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:41,199
save link as

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,880
and so okay so we have to save so this

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,360
is now a gpl file

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,639
so we have to save this in a specific

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,960
folder

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,160
and this is the folder so this is for

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,800
windows

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,800
you can find the uh folder you can find

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,680
this palette inkscape palettes in your

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,080
um

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,680
users and then you go to app data

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,720
roaming inkscape and then you go to

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,759
palettes

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,800
for other os's you can look it up it's

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,160
very easy

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,840
um you can just search and you can find

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:15,440
where you have to save your gpl files

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,080
so i've already saved all these palettes

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,479
and after you do that just restarting

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,120
skip if it's already open and you will

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,880
see the app

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:29,840
option here and you can change it here

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:33,120
okay so we have now set up the pilot

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,600
so this next step is to import graphics

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,520
so we are going to design the nest with

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,080
fedora at ndpark so of course we are

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,680
going to use the next logo

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:48,080
so i'm going to import the svg here

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:51,680
i will import or control i

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,599
and i'm gonna download the nest logo

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,440
and be so sorry i'm gonna import it i've

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,080
already downloaded it

00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,720
you can find it in the design repo and

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,720
the ticket

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,520
so or you can just ask anyone in the

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,120
design team they will guide you to it if

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,479
you're looking for specific

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,800
logos or not work so there we go

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,919
so now we have set up our environment

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,680
successfully

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,960
and now we can start with designing the

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,560
patch

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,599
i'm just gonna check quickly if there

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,599
are any questions

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,880
okay

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,680
so the next thing that we're gonna do is

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,960
we are going to

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,440
use this to fit here so

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,080
i'm going to get rid of the background

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,960
since this is an svg file you can easily

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,319
edit it

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,000
so all you have to do is you have to

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,720
ungroup so this

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
is a collection of objects which are

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,680
grouped together so i'm just going to

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,639
ungroup this

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,520
you can also use the shortcut ctrl shift

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,000
d

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,919
sometimes you have to do it two to three

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,879
times depending on how many times it's

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,280
grouped

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,400
so as you can see we now have all of

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:07,120
these objects

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:10,160
individually we can select them

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,720
just put that back there and

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,520
we do this and we have removed the

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,319
background

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,680
so you can delete it at this point uh we

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,560
are going to use this later

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,160
so i'm just going to keep this here it

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,479
doesn't matter because this

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,479
is the page like this area right here

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,400
this is our canvas so anything that is

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:32,560
not on the canvas

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,800
um will not interfere with the final png

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,839
if we export it correctly that is so i'm

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,200
just gonna

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,680
i'm just gonna group it again so a

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,479
tip to quickly select a lot of objects

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,800
is to

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,760
drag and select and anything that is

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,279
within this

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:52,800
bounding box right here will be selected

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,399
so let's see if i do it only this even

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,519
though it's touching

00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,240
the cloud it didn't select it so

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,519
anything that is completely inside the

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,120
bounding box

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:07,200
will be selected so you might not

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,640
think this is a pretty big deal but when

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,440
you have a lot of objects

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,240
ah this comes in really handy if you

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,760
because

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,839
sometimes there are a lot of objects

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,720
placed close by so all you have to do is

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,040
make sure that it's

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,399
not in the enclosing box right so i'm

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,440
gonna group it

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,440
and we are good to go

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,279
so now i'm going to resize there so that

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,519
it fits here

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,760
uh and the thing is when you're resizing

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,640
objects make sure that you lock

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,040
the aspect ratio right here because if

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,120
you

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:42,320
don't this is what's going to happen

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,440
and we do not want to squish this little

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,160
word

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,920
we do not want to squeeze it especially

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,240
with logos you have to be careful

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,399
to not basically deform them in any way

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,959
and even general artwork doesn't look

00:09:54,399 --> 00:10:01,040
good and it's squished or squeezed

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:04,720
so just click this lock icon and

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:08,880
there you go

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:13,360
right so i'm just gonna resize it

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,360
i think that's pretty good yeah

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:20,480
so the next step is

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,480
oh okay so these are my notes i need

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,839
them here so that i don't have to

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,600
switch back and forth i'm just going to

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,959
drag this off the canvas

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:34,240
you can delete it you might use it later

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:38,240
so yeah

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:42,399
now the thing is i want to

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:46,079
put this logo in the center of the badge

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:49,440
so i can either eyeball it which is

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:52,640
not going to be accurate at all or

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,040
i can maybe use grids

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,040
so i can set up grids and try to measure

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,560
it but again that is not going to be

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,839
very active

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,760
thankfully we have a pretty good tool

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,200
here which is called the align and

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,120
distribute tool

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,279
so the shortcut is shift ctrl and a

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,360
and you have a bunch of different

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,519
options here so as you can see you can

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,720
select the context here

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,320
where you want to how you want to

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,519
basically align the object

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,440
so you have a couple of different

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,959
options you can align it to the page to

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,240
the last selected object

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:30,959
the biggest object and after that

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,600
you have a lot of different options so

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,560
you can align the vertical centers

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,680
the horizontal centers the top edges the

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,320
bottom edges

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,680
so this is going to make your job really

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,360
simple and easy

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,880
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,880
select this object

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,560
then i'm going to select this shape

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,600
right here this is the center of the

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,480
badge

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,480
i'm going to select this and i'm going

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,160
to align the horizontal

00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:01,279
and vertical axis there we go okay

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,399
so this

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,480
object right here this represents the

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,200
center of the batch

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,880
some of you might ask why we did not

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,440
center it to the page

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,639
and the thing is the center of the page

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,959
is not the same

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,040
as the center of the batch because if

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,839
you look carefully

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,880
there is a slight shadow here on the

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,399
bottom

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:29,839
so what it does is it raises

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,639
the center of the badge a couple of

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,079
pixels

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:39,279
above the center of the page

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:41,920
and oh it's a very small difference

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,880
but it's enough to make a difference

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,959
right

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:49,279
uh so i'm going to undo it

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,240
there we go so make sure that if you're

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,680
aligning objects

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,519
align it either to either to this shape

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,760
or you can align it to the ring or you

00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:01,279
can align it to the white

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,680
badge shape but make sure that you do

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,440
not

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,959
align it to the page because of the

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,600
shadow

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,200
okay so now that we have aligned it

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,320
what's the next step

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:16,320
let's see the set

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:20,320
clip okay so there is this

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,000
really awesome feature in escape

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,320
and i'm going to show you what it does

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,480
before i explain

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,680
what it is because it's easier to

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,680
explain it

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,720
easier to show it than to explain it

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,519
okay

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,560
so this is the background that i had

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,600
earlier

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:42,000
let's see for example i wanted

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:44,800
to put up a little nice sky

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,600
sort of color here for the board maybe

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,360
maybe

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:53,600
and i want it to be on the top half

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:58,240
now how do i make sure that we have this

00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:00,560
correct badge space shape right here

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,600
how do i do that this is a pretty handy

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,519
tool

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,519
and that is called set clip so what it's

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,600
going to do is that clip

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,839
is going to wait actually

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,839
so

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,680
this is what's going to happen now i'm

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,519
going to

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:24,720
undo it and explain it step by step

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:27,839
so it helps if you imagine

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,560
this shape the shape that you want

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,160
as the cookie cutter so this is your

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,720
cookie cutter right here

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,120
and this is your roll of cookie dough

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,079
and you want to

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,279
cut this in the shape of the cookie

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,240
cutter

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:46,560
so what you do is you duplicate this

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,360
object because this object is going to

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,519
be

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,279
used up when you are cutting the cookie

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:55,120
so

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:57,600
i'm going to press ctrl d

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,360
and it's going to duplicate right on top

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,440
of the original object

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,519
you can also right click and select

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,360
duplicate here

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:10,560
right um so a couple of people ask

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,560
why we use duplicate instead of

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,399
copying and pasting and the thing is in

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,040
inkscape when you are copying and

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,160
pasting an

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,079
object let's see i have copied it to my

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,360
clipboard and if i paste it it's going

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,480
to paste

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,360
where my mouse pointer is

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,000
so you see it's going to paste it

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,680
wherever my mouse pointer is

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,079
and the thing is you want the object

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,000
to be on you want the duplicate to be on

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,720
top of the object

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,720
so that's why it's you should use the

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,560
duplicate tool instead of copying and

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,759
pasting because you're bound to

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,800
miss the original object by

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:53,759
even a couple of pixels so after you do

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,279
that you select the duplicated object

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,320
make sure it's on top of the cookie

00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:01,680
dough that's how you cut cookies right

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,920
and select the dough

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,920
and

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:13,040
secret there we go so

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,880
let's zoom in here if you see it's

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,600
precise and it will be because we use

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,880
the duplicate tool

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,639
and it's going to find applications in a

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,120
lot of places

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:29,680
so let's see if you download

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,199
a badge so this is here we have this

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,880
little

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:37,759
badger cowboy so

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:41,600
if i go right here and i release clip

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,600
this is going to release the clip

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:48,560
and i drag this right here

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,399
so we have this whole panda right here

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,600
we have this whole badger right here

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,360
and by using the set clip tool we

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,880
actually cut it off

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,639
so it's a great tool when you're

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,680
designing that just because you

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:04,000
will want to use it this is not a very

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,199
natural shape this one right here so

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,799
your graphics are neat are going to

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:14,880
need to be clipped

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:17,919
right let's go ahead and undo that also

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,679
as we saw this tool is non-destructive

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,319
and what that means is

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,640
you can use the release clip to have

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,439
your original objects back

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,440
that's why we have this we had the whole

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,000
badger here

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,120
so this tool is really helpful and if

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,919
you download

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,640
um older badges you can find a lot of

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,240
artwork

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,919
hidden in these clips so

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,840
yeah it's i'm gonna see if we have any

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:49,360
questions

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:52,640
justin hi

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:55,919
okay so

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,559
let's see the last thing we have to do

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,440
is

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,000
right so we are going to make the number

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,840
so i'm gonna

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:07,600
add 20 20 here just in case

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,600
uh we have nest next year also so

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,640
marie actually suggested this to me so

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,440
you need

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,640
it's i guess with experience you have

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,240
this sort of insight

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:23,039
so i'm just gonna use this 2020

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,559
and we always use comforter typeface for

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,039
any numberings or text that we use

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,520
inside the batches you can download the

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,320
link to download this typeface is in the

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,600
style

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,360
in the docs page itself so you can

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,720
always go there

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:41,120
now let me just so if you see

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,640
right here we have a very unique way of

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,960
numbering so

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,200
if you see there are three layers so

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,160
this is the original number there there

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,039
is a middle tone

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,919
and then there is the darker tone so

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:56,720
what happens is if you zoom out

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,480
it gives it a sort of a 3d effect and

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,720
looks really good

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,559
so we are going to see how we do that

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,400
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,919
first

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:15,120
reduce the corning a bit so that it's

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:19,200
squeezed together there we go

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,039
um yeah okay so now we're going to use

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,640
this tool right here this is the fill

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,760
bounded areas too

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,679
so the shortcut is u and you can see

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,120
what color we have here we have this

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,799
color i'm going to

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:35,840
use the color picker tool to

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:38,440
change the color that i have and

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,679
there we go so

00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,760
[Music]

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,760
now if you click on this too

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,080
there we go so what it does is it it

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:54,640
sort of creates a bounded

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,640
area with the color that you chose

00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,720
wow escape is exceptionally sloped i

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,240
think it's because i am also streaming

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,159
side by side that's okay okay so we have

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,760
this right here

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:12,960
and if i use this tool i'm going to

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,960
lower the selection

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,880
on praying see it doesn't crash right

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,440
now

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,280
because i feel like it's going to crash

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,880
i hope not

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:30,320
so there you go

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,880
yeah so now all the

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,400
boundary areas are beneath the text so

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,520
you have this sort of cool outline

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,600
effect

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,799
and to get the third layer i'm going to

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,320
use this tool again

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,320
and hopefully it will be easier this

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,120
time around

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,120
select this

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:52,080
um yep

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:55,840
there we go so it's

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,360
it created the outline for the whole

00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,600
thing because all of these were now

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:05,280
touching so

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,280
if i bring it to the bottom

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:12,880
i'm gonna save this because i think

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:16,559
escape is gonna crash any moment now

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:20,159
wow okay

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:24,159
and the last thing we do is change

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,159
this color right here to white

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,480
there we go great so

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,760
you can play adjust with adjust the

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,120
colors the thickness

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:40,320
everything um and then after you do that

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:44,640
just group it all together i

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:46,880
used ctrl g yeah there we go

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,880
and

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:55,440
wow that's a lot okay and

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,760
you can play around with it maybe you

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,000
can change the color i think this color

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,720
this

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,679
one i did not use the correct color i

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,360
think i should

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:08,559
have used okay

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,200
just trying to remove this

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,760
this one is going to work a lot better

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,919
so

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,280
yeah you do that you play around with

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,559
the colors

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:22,320
um you can even align

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:23,919
this whole thing with the words

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,360
i'm going to use the line and distribute

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,840
tool again

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:34,400
and select that and yeah

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:37,280
so yeah you should fix that

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,880
and after that just make sure the

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,360
background is

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,320
um looks good and then you're good to go

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:47,520
you have successfully

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:51,360
completed your first match yeah but

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:54,640
the thing is it's not over

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:57,520
there is still a very crucial step

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,400
and i know we are almost out of time but

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,320
thankfully

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:04,080
we are about to be done

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,320
so this is the most important step i

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,240
would say because even after you

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,400
did everything correctly if you don't

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,760
export it correctly

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,840
it's going to be reviewed

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,120
and it's going to be exported correctly

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,480
so it's not going to work if you don't

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,520
export it correctly

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,200
so this is the final badge um

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,640
made a few modifications change the

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,679
bathroom a bit

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,600
and then we export it as a png right

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,919
so what you have to do is you select

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,840
page here make sure you select the page

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:37,039
because it's really important

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:40,799
we need to export it at this

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:43,200
particular size 256 by 256 pixels

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,279
if you export it as a drawing which is

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,720
the default option

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,360
what you're going to do is going to

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,880
export everything right here so if i do

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:56,480
this what's going to

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:59,440
happen is let's see

00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,440
let me open this

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:07,039
and write

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,960
this is what's going to happen you have

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,840
this text phone so it's going to export

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,039
everything

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,240
that is on the screen so just select the

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:18,480
page

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:22,880
export and replace

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,880
and there we go

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,919
we just successfully designed the first

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,480
batch

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,840
and after you upload it to the ticket

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,760
you upload the png

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,360
and the svg so that if there are any

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,200
changes to be made

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,039
uh someone else can also do that someone

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,400
from the design team maybe

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:42,960
and then you are good to go

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,799
so and also this is the badge that all

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,799
of you can get right now so

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:50,640
if you go to the reception you will find

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,640
the link to get this patch

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,320
ah marie oh don't forget to say yeah

00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,159
it's really important to save

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:05,200
um happens so many times

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:06,720
that yeah the escape crashes wait i'm

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,000

even when i started initially there was

00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:59,440
a lot of um problems that i

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,640
worked that i had to work on i would not

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,200
export it correctly

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,559
i would not save it and escape crashes

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,720
sometimes

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:09,600
especially since there is a new version

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:13,440
now in skateboard 1.0 i think

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,440
