	00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,759
so my name is brian stinson i work on

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,720
the community platform engineering team

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,240
at red hat

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,440
um typically the uh the thing i spend my

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,599
day job on is

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,719
um working on centos stream which i'm

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,920
here to talk to us

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,920
a little bit about today

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,320
for the most part i kind of want to want

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,439
us to think a little bit about what

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,320
happens

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,320
uh what happened before centos stream

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,760
kind of came on the stage and

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,439
you may have heard one or two things

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,559
about centos stream before and so

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,160
i want us to kind of go back maybe um

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,160
you know think think about a year ago

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,440
about how the relationship

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,559
worked between uh fedora red hat

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,160
enterprise linux

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,600
and centos linux and it looks something

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,520
probably like this

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,239
um and sorry about those little

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,239
transitions there

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,920
when you think about what what redhead

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,280
is doing to build red hat enterprise

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,120
linux you know we always thought of

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,840
fedora as the upstream

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,000
um you know with the the individual

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,519
projects even further upstream

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,840
uh so we gather everything up into

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,439
fedora package it together

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,000
and uh at certain points during

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,600
the life cycle there red hat takes the

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,920
content from fedor and turns it into red

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,119
hat enterprise linux and then down the

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,119
uh down the road we would do

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,119
centos linux which was built from the

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,680
same sources as rel

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,560
uh in the if you think of this in terms

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,680
of

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,960
um of interactions and code flows and

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,720
things like that there's a whole lot of

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,119
arrows going around right

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,920
um sometimes rel takes things from

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,960
fedora

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,320
uh sometimes we found things out in the

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,119
um in the centos linux space that

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,759
uh people wanted to make changes fix

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,360
bugs

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,880
uh things like that and so these we've

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,840
got these arrows kind of going around

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,880
everywhere

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,759
um well we found a uh

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,040
uh kind of a few uh things that are

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,200
interesting related to that

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,920
mostly that this feedback loop of um

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,680
you know fedora rel centos and then back

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,120
and forth and back and forth that loop

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,040
ended up becoming um kind of long

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,640
uh people who were using set house linux

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,480
would uh

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,959
they were only able to affect things

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,000
after a rail release is

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,280
already done and baked and and sent out

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,560
um and then there's also the the fact

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,000
that a lot of

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,040
uh a lot of rel development happens

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,200
uh you know inside of red hat and

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,760
that's uh uh something that we wanted to

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,480
to kind of take a look at a little bit

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,800
and so i want to take um talk a little

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,599
bit about some of the goals for

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,040
uh the the centaur stream project and

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,920
centos stream was announced

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,120
um you know a while ago now we're kind

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,040
of in the middle of

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,560
uh the bootstrap phase here which we'll

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,200
we'll talk about in just a little bit

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,440
but

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,959
uh some of the the higher level goals

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,760
that we're talking about

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,120
um i i just want to kind of go through

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,680
some of those real quick

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,080
the first one is transparent development

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,200
of the next rel minor release

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,319
and so what does that mean if you think

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,680
of where we are in the

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,480
in terms of the um the life cycle right

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,000
now

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,920
uh you may have noticed that red hat

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,599
enterprise linux just released

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:27,040
the beta for 8.3

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:30,159
um and we we think that centos stream

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,560
uh is probably going to be a vehicle for

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,159
where

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,920
folks can actually get a preview of

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,040
what's going into

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,319
the next minor release of rel so 8.3 and

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,519
you know soon to be 8.4 things like that

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,840
before it actually comes out and we want

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,159
that to be

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,560
uh we want that for a couple of reasons

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,519
number one transparency is important to

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,519
us and

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,120
feeding into the development of the next

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,239
rel minor release

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,599
is it's just important to get feedback

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,519
as early as possible

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,879
so if you go back um you know a couple

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,599
of slides ago where we had all those

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,640
arrows

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,519
floating around we want people on

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,280
the uh who are actually consuming

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,159
enterprise linux to be able to affect

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,400
things

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,400
on a reasonable time scale um

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,320
the one of the goals that um

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,639
or one of the ways that we actually make

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,960
the transparent development

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,040
of the next raw minor release happen is

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,199
uh we want to collaborate directly with

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,320
rel maintainers and i know we're we're

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,360
used to

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,440
um to doing that in fedora a little bit

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,280
real maintainers participate actively

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,080
and both in fedora

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,440
and then developers are are also pretty

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,919
active there in

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,720
fedora and in the upstreams uh of

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,840
everything that makes

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,360
um uh makes it into our releases but

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:57,280
this is another point where uh

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,840
we found a kind of a space that we

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,240
needed

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,199
to fill with a distribution that's

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,600
focused on that

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,960
rel minor release and pulling everyone

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,039
together so that you can collaborate

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,960
directly with maintainers working on

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,199
uh the minor releases is was really

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,280
important

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,639
and then as part of the uh the centos

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,720
project in general

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,919
uh centos stream gives us some some

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,520
interesting things

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,440
um uh it gives us some

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,919
layers of experimentation is what i call

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,720
it if you're familiar with the special

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,840
interest group process in centos

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,720
right now we have folks like

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,320
like rdo the the openstack folks who are

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,160
building their content on top of

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,440
the community build system and and some

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,800
other things

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,560
this lets us do some interesting

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,240
things because if we have a preview of

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,759
the next minor release

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,400
folks like rdo um even some of the

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,199
uh the other upstream projects can come

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,319
uh and

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,919
build on top of um uh

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,360
of santos stream and then get a preview

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,520
of what you know what's gonna come out

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,120
next and so they they know

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,199
uh they have a pretty good indication of

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,560
what's gonna come out uh

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,240
for the future minor releases

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,560
but one thing that we're we're

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,600
considering too is expanding the idea of

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,080
a sig

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:21,680
um to to kind of take some of the

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,759
uh the exploratory contributions uh

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,800
as we kind of feed into this process so

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,000
centos stream is

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,120
is very narrowly focused on uh

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,319
you know feeding into the real

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,840
development process but we want to take

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,400
that content and allow some other places

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,080
for people to do other bits of

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,800
experimentation

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,520
on enterprise linux when maybe fedora

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,639
has actually

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,599
you know moved on to um to looking

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,120
further in the future and so if we have

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,720
all these goals pulled together

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,599
um you know with uh uh

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,400
with centos stream focused on a a minor

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,120
release

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,319
and you know we we do the same uh thing

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,400
that we're used to about bringing up a

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,039
real major release in fedora

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,639
the overall and and i know this is um

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,960
this is going to be kind of simple

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:15,440
and uh so i i want you to know that we

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,000
you know we this is very simplified

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,160
diagram

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,319
but this is what we're thinking here

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,919
moving centos over here in the middle

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,720
so that it um it sits kind of in the

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,880
middle of

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,759
uh you know what the fedora life cycle

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,400
is and what

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,440
feeds into redhead enterprise linux this

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,880
is kind of the

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,560
um like a really cartoonish picture of

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,560
what we would like to see

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,680
and it puts things kind of in a better

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,000
place

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,520
uh so that we all have a viewpoint of

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,919
what's coming next with rel

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,599
and i want to talk a little bit about uh

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,919
what we're doing right now

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,360
uh because again we're in the middle of

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,639
the bring up phase with centos stream

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,039
and so we're not

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,400
uh we're working towards that ideal

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,759
picture that we just showed

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,039
just a minute ago um we're in the middle

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,840
of the bring up phase

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,919
and i want to talk a little bit about

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,199
some of our constraints that we have

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:14,319
uh because this is you know moving

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,440
uh is moving centos stream sort of

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,599
towards the middle

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,039
to where it's upstream of the next minor

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,160
version of rel that sort of thing

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,120
that's a big uh that's a big shift in

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,599
both mindset

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,520
and then also process right there's a

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,599
lot of stuff that happens

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,680
when rel developers do their day-to-day

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,440
work um

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,599
you know they pull stuff directly from

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,120
upstream and and rebased packages

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,800
they pull stuff from uh fedora

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,680
and you know backport things into

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:48,320
interrel and we didn't really want to

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,000
um upset the

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,279
uh you know a lot of the internal

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,480
processes that they go through on a

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,519
day-to-day basis

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,360
while we're in the middle of building

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,320
the infrastructure to make this happen

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,920
and so that's why i say

00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,959
you know there's some caveats here about

00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,760
being in the middle of the bring up

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,880
phase and

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,560
um we'll talk a little bit about how the

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,040
sources flow

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,279
i'm going to take an individual package

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,640
and we'll just kind of walk through

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:15,680
what it looks like here real quick

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,120
so let's say you wanted to

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:22,080
affect something in the mudder package

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,279
this screenshot here is get.centos.org

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,640
and you can see a number of different

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,800
branches

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,000
if you've paid attention to the centos

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,160
ecosystem before

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,839
you kind of know how this works the c7

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,360
branch

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,760
all of that stuff is content that makes

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,160
it into centos linux 7.

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,080
same thing for c8 those are sources that

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,320
come directly from red hat

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,360
after a release happens so they push to

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,120
that branch

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,959
it gets rebuilt into centos linux and

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,480
then

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,160
shifted out that way i don't want to

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,360
focus too much on those because

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,120
again this is for uh for stream purposes

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,440
if you look down at the very bottom of

00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,880
that branch list there's a c8s

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:04,320
branch that's where uh

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,680
the content uh

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,600
that's where we basically build the

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,720
content for each and every package that

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,959
comes in

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,640
and to kind of lift the covers on on how

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,360
that process happens a little bit

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,519
um we're still doing a little bit of of

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,200
work to actually take sources from

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,360
internal to red hat and pull them back

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,079
out into the public so that we can

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,200
give that preview and stuff um i'll talk

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,240
a minute about what's

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,600
uh about how we expected to address that

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,560
a little bit but

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,600
um but yeah for now the c8s branch you

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,800
can consider that

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,240
at this point in time august 7th 2020

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,399
uh the c8s branch points at um

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,760
what we think is probably going to make

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:48,560
it into

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:51,760
uh red hat enterprise linux 8.3 and

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,760
so if you want to make a change um

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,040
you can you know interact with these

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,440
sources in here

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,480
um see what's going on on each of the

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,800
branches

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,920
and i know i see carl george here in

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,240
chat he's our

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,519
uh our steward of uh of some of these

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,000
patches here so

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,959
uh he'd be a good person to to double

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,480
check with

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,600
uh about how to how to make all this

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:17,120
happen but um

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,480
there is a com a version in red hat

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,839
bugzilla

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,880
uh called centos stream and that's the

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,880
uh that's sort of the touch point for

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,440
where we actually bring patches into the

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,040
company and get them in front of the

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,160
the rel maintainers and stuff so

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,079
you know there's there's a couple of

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,480
ways that you can do this you can

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,279
do patches directly against

00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,480
get.centos.org and then we'll

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,120
um i'm volunteering carl to uh to kind

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,640
of help

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,160
manage some of that process because he's

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,000
already volunteered but

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,519
um the the idea is we we attach a patch

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,399
to a bugzilla and then it makes it

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,040
through the

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,639
normal rail process that happens today

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,480
and i promise i won't bore you with all

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,360
of those details because you

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,480
um that would be a few talks in and of

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,959
itself but

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,360
um attaching things to a bugzilla gets

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,440
it on the rail maintainers radar

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,839
and they do the things that they do in

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,040
order to get a rel build

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,880
um internally so internally there's a

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,000
real build of mudder

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,800
and then we pick it up from

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,160
one of the nightlys and the way that we

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,680
do that

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,240
as you can see this is a list of the

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,200
commits that um

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,040
that we have for this package and you

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,680
can see that there's the

00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:40,800
3.32.2-46 is the one that we pushed in

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,079
so this made it into a a rel nightly

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,880
compose at some point

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,160
and then we pulled those sources into

00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:49,920
get.centos.org to get them

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,920
going for stream and then

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,160
we can see what the build looks like

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,440
here you can see that carl did this uh

00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:01,600
this build for us and tagged it in for

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:06,480
a compose and then it shows up on

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:09,760
the mirrors so this is mirror.centos.org

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,279
centos slash eight dash stream

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,959
and you can see that there's the the

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,720
regular repository layout i could have

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:18,240
dug in here and showed you the

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,440
uh the actual um package but

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,360
uh you'll just have to trust me that

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,200
it's uh it's all in there

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:29,200
um our aim is

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,200
uh to actually make this process uh

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,720
transparent you know we're we're working

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,720
on a lot of automation to bring these

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,440
sources from internal to external while

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,920
we're

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,440
in the middle of um of the eight life

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,920
cycle and stuff

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,880
uh but we're also looking to get this

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,600
out as

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,720
as quickly as possible and the last i

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,639
heard

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,160
we have all the sources pushed from last

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,680
night's nightly uh

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,120
we're you know catching up on builds

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,839
because that that typically takes a

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,480
while but

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,800
you'll see that um that stuff reflected

00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,600
uh fairly quickly out on

00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,199
mirror.centos.org that you can install

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:06,720
on your machine today

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:06,720
and and try all this out

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,560
so this is how we're making it happen

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,240
today

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,800
uh what's coming up next um

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,079
there's a few things and again while

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,160
we're in the boots

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,440
in this uh in this bring up process

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,160
there's a

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,320
uh a little bit of work for us to do

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,240
just as a team to to keep things

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,760
things going uh i mentioned that uh

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,839
you know we're pulling those sources

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,760
internally uh we're doing our best to

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,720
keep ahead and make sure that we

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,480
push the content both on a source level

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,920
but also on a binary level on a regular

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,399
basis so that we have

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,279
a steady stream no pun intended of

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,800
content

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:52,720
that comes to your workstation as you

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,720
as you do updates and things like that

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:59,040
we want to start building sigs and

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,959
we've got some pretty well established

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,519
ones that are building against centos

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,639
linux

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,160
and we're going to start with some of

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,560
those to kind of transition over to

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,680
uh you know doing regular builds against

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,040
centos stream

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,160
and we think that's going to help quite

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,680
a bit with

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,920
you know both catching things as they

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,279
come in but

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:24,320
also allowing us and the sigs and

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,399
red hat and the different maintainers to

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,839
all have a conversation together

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,320
about what does uh what does enterprise

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,759
linux

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:37,600
look like uh as we go over the

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:39,040
the phases of eight um of relate

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,639
and that's those are important

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,480
conversations to have and it's why we

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,759
call santa stream the shared space

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,040
because you know it's centos stream is

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,959
meant to be

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,560
uh kind of directed by red hat and by

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,000
the maintainers you know those people

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,959
are meant to be in charge of

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,560
uh of what happens here but it's a place

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,680
for us all to get together and to talk

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,199
about

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,680
uh bugs features

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,399
anything that we want to see uh you know

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,360
as we

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,839
uh head on towards future versions of of

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,839
rel

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,920
and so we want to exit the bring up

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,880
phase uh

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,480
you know this is not our um this is not

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,839
the end state for what we want to see

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,440
out of stream

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:25,600
because to be honest the the whole

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,440
uh pulling internal sources and bringing

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,920
them external and then building them and

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,920
then

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,600
releasing to them to the mirrors and all

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,920
that stuff that's a little bit awkward

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,079
to

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,959
to meet our goal uh if you go back to

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,680
that

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,639
that kind of cartoon picture of uh was

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,079
centos in the middle

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,440
we want to get out of this bring up

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,440
phase and

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,440
and see what that means in order to be a

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,240
true

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,000
upstream of the next minor release of

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,519
rel

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,279
and what is uh so what does that mean it

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,959
means we need to settle in

00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:01,440
uh into our space uh taking you know

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,559
regular handoffs with eln

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,679
um so eln has meant

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,959
meant to be the uh sort of the proving

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,640
ground for

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:16,079
uh building fedora rawhide

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,439
with an enterprise build route and uh

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,120
you know talking about some of the

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,600
things that that means and i think

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,120
there's a good talk on sunday uh from

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,000
stephen gallagher about

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,640
how eln fits in this picture but we

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,919
think that

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,640
uh that these will have uh

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,200
these will be controlling venues for

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,240
different parts of

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,080
the enterprise linux space and so eln is

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,679
very active during the bootstrap phase

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,280
of a major version

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,440
centos stream is active

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,880
during the bring up phase for each minor

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,559
version and

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,360
you know we all interact together with

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,039
uh with red hat

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,559
ultimately we want the real maintainers

00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:00,799
to take over

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:04,480
uh you know both in terms of

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:07,760
of dealing with content that comes in

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,919
from pull requests or changes that you

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,720
want to make as the community

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,520
we want them to to be active in that

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,360
process

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,360
and making sure that they have the tools

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,799
and everything that they need in order

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,799
to make that happen

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,720
and we've got you know plenty of

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,120
infrastructure to bring up in order to

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,440
uh to help them with that but uh this is

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,799
the ultimate goal is real maintainers

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,799
you know when you interact on a package

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,840
for centos stream you're interacting

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,440
with

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,440
the rel maintainers

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,240
and so i want to end up with a a few of

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,919
the different

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,520
spaces that you can come and talk to us

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,600
right now

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,720
uh first of all if you want to download

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,240
and uh

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,520
and try sent out stream it's available

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,400
for you right now we've got install

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,760
media

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,600
um i think the we need to respin some

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,039
cloud images soon so that you um you

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,400
have that sort of thing but

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,240
you can head to the download page

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,280
there's a link to the isos and

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,080
and things like that um we've got an irc

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,600
channel

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,360
a half centos stream on free node

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,600
and if you hit up the centos devel

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,799
mailing list we're happy to take

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,400
um the uh

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,919
some questions there and then there's

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:24,640
some documentation and faqs

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,679
out on the wiki for that so i ended up a

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,400
little bit early

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:31,039
um in order to take some questions from

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:36,240
the chat if we have them

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:37,760
uh and i'm just

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,919
scrolling through so if we have

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,120
questions here

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:48,000
i am happy to look at them

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,000
otherwise we can end this up and

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,840
there we go we have a good question how

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,559
much of stream is still based on centos

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,880
linux

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,160
and how long until it's self-sufficient

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,799
that's a good question

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,240
so uh you know talking about this in in

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,760
terms of how we

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,480
brought centaur stream up in the first

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:08,240
place we kind of

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,720
pulled together centos linux and uh

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,520
in order to uh kind of bootstrap a lot

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,679
of the

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,799
uh the package content in terms of

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,000
content

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,400
centos stream is um is well independent

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,120
of

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,400
the content that's in centos linux i

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,039
think we're down to

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,400
um you know basically finding out pieces

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,840
of the branding

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,840
and uh you know notifying the

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,520
the user the fact that you know this is

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,520
indeed uh

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,520
sent off stream instead of centos linux

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,919
and so there's a lot of

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,640
tiny details now but in terms of content

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,679
there

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:46,240
the two distributions are are produced

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,240
separately

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,480
uh let's see are there container images

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,919
available for stream

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,400
uh currently we are not producing

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:57,440
container images um

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,320
but we are uh re-spinning the install

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,520
media

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,679
uh on a regular basis so we're

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,799
shooting for at least once a week and

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,480
then the

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,400
uh the same thing with the cloud images

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,039
those are a little bit further behind

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,480
but

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,000
the idea is um that

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,640
we want to get those on a regular basis

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,520
as well

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,520
i don't see any more questions

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,360
here so i'm going to wrap it up and

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,840
thank you all for

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,840
