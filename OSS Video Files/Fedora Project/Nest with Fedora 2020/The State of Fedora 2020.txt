welcome everybody

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
to this year's fedora event nest with

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,160
fedora

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,120
i am really glad that you all were able

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,240
to take the time

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,080
to come here i see 136 people online by

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,119
the little indicator uh

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,240
that's very exciting i know it's strange

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,680
times

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,640
and we started this fairly early on the

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,160
east coast

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,760
and if you are like me time has lost all

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,800
meaning and you may not even be on a

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,000
normal schedule

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,640
so um i really appreciate you joining

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,360
here

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,280
um i saw in the polls here that this is

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,160
the first fedora event for

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,920
about half of people so a special

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,879
welcome to the newcomers here i hope

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,200
that

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,160
you enjoy this and find us a great

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,920
welcoming

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,760
introduction to the craziness that is

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,000
our project

00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,000
um i am broadcasting here from

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,160
um corner of my bedroom which is the

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,879
place i do video calls from it's not the

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,280
nicest

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,920
background uh adam williamson the other

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,320
day

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,360
uh suggested that it might be a murder

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,320
addict

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,799
um it is kind of an attic but as far as

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,640
i know

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,360
there have been no murders here for at

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,640
least two and a half years so

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,680
it's fine um it is very

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,920
weird though because unlike a real

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,040
conference where i would be talking to

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,280
an audience

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,200
i am just sitting in the corner here

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,040
literally talking to myself

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,880
so very strange but i'll try

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,640
and do that do this um

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,399
we are doing this um you may have

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,200
noticed we're calling this nest

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,119
instead of virtual flock um that's

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,320
because

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,920
fedora is basically every day of the

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,079
year all year long

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,479
the thing that most people wish their

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,640
virtual conferences would be as good as

00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,119
like we have collaboration we have fun

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,119
we have

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,640
technical things we make decisions we

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,000
talk together

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,840
so like fedora is basically constantly a

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,280
ongoing virtual event and the whole

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,840
point of flock

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,640
is to actually get people face to face

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,360
you know in

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,080
physical real world to see each other

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,720
and

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,080
make connections and do high bandwidth

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,360
you know kind of things that are easier

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,040
that way but

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,400
mostly really to bring our community

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,319
together in a

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,040
literal way and obviously it's weird to

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,000
then

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,920
make that back to virtual again so this

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,120
is nest it's not flock it's something

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,120
different

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,920
but one thing i particularly want to

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,760
emphasize is

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,680
that connection making and the having

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,080
fun is really going to be the important

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,000
part of this so please

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,360
if you have to decide if i'm going to

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,440
you're going to see a technical talk or

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,400
go to a social thing like do the social

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,319
thing because

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,440
the technical talks will be there i'm

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,120
not saying you shouldn't go to the

00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,200
technical talks but if you have to

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,120
if you're picking that's the um

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,400
i see a comment that says this is

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,519
there's no stage fright

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,000
actually i am much i i hate this

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,040
much more i'd much rather be up on stage

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,720
um

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,959
you know seeing my friends in the

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,040
audience and talking rather than

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:21,920
talking to the void here

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,920
but anyways here we go presentation

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,640
beginning

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,440
oh wait uh see awesome slide mess up

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,360
right again

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,599
all right so um the purpose of this

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,000
slide is to show you that i actually put

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,080
some thought

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,840
and organization into what's going to

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,280
come afterwards because it's going to

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,879
seem like a bunch of stream of

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,840
consciousness talking and

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,920
there is an organization to it um i am

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,840
noticing here that i actually reordered

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,799
it and didn't retain reorder my bullets

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,120
so that's

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,760
that's very on brand for me here the

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,400
important part is yes i planned this

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,280
um and the other important part is

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,519
questions

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,519
um i am not going to be following the

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,159
chat here and i hope to leave some time

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,120
for questions

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,760
at the end um address your questions to

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,680
marie

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,799
and she is going to collect them for me

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,760
and then ask them

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,760
at the end part of the talk so

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,120
here's where i make the silent green

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,959
joke every year and i

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,400
i guess i'll do it again because it's a

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,639
good joke fedora

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,759
is made of people that's really what the

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,320
project is

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,800
um i know it's kind of a windmill

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,400
tilting exercise but i really like if

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,520
you talk about fedora what should come

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,520
first to your mind

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,199
is the people in this picture and the

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,280
people who couldn't be at that picture

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,240
and the rest of the community like we

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,400
are fedora

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,400
uh fedora is not an operating system the

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,800
fedora workstation for our server for

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,800
our core os but our iot fedora kde

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,240
fedora mate computes whatever

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,080
all the things those are those are

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,440
things we make but fedora is

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,000
is us um i had a friend who in college

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,040
would call

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,840
microsoft word microsoft and it drove me

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,160
crazy

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,080
um i hope to instill in everybody that

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,880
same little twitch if someone just calls

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,360
the operating

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,800
system fedora because it's it's really

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,440
important that this is a

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,240
human person-driven project and it's not

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,600
just

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,080
not just the technology yeah so

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,000
um obviously this year we are not going

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,800
to be able to take a group photo

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
quite like this um and again speaking of

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,560
twitchy

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,960
i'm seeing a shocking lack of social

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,400
distancing and no masks in this photo

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:33,759
it's kind of making me feel nervous

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,759
but so marie is working on a plan to

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,039
actually collect people's photos to make

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,960
a collage picture

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:43,840
of the nest attendance

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,560
group photo so we'll have more details

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,759
about that

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,759
later so yes fedora is people

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,680
and this is a new org chart um that was

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,360
done with open source software because i

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,199
had previously drawn one using a web

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,000
service that was not open source and

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,720
everybody rightly said come on we can't

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,360
have that

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,160
so here's a nice new one all the people

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,000
in fedora

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,840
are all organized into all of these

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,039
different groups and it's kind of big

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:17,600
and confusing and crazy um although

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:19,520
if i saw some people been at uh fud cons

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,880
and flocks for a long time if you were

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,639
at the first flock

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,199
in prague we drew on a white board

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,280
the organization of fedora at that time

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,160
and it was just as crazy as this

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,080
but there was no organization or pattern

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,880
to it so i hope that over the last

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,039
you know few years we've kind of made it

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,360
easier to get involved in fedora

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,520
by making this flow more clear and i

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,639
hope that helps if you're new to fedora

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,479
and are looking you know how

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,080
how things all fit together together

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,080
this can be kind of intimidating

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,360
but um i'll talk a little bit later

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,759
about the fedora join

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,280
sig that can kind of help steer you to

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,479
where you need to go

00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,639
this is a big project it's kind of great

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,560
and i i'm just always impressed with all

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,240
the different parts of it and how well

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,919
they all work um of course

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,479
fedora is discussion this is

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,240
we have we we do a lot of talking i

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,360
talked about you know how we are a

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,680
a ongoing virtual conference uh there

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,560
are

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,000
you know hundreds uh approaching

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,919
thousands of meetings

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,520
every year that basically make the

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,880
decision making and kind of the

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,440
the meat of making fedora go that and

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,120
the fedora devel mailing list on which

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,319
we've had a lot of good exciting

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,960
discussions

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,240
lately some about some technical changes

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,440
and

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,599
my favorite about changing the default

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,919
text editor to a simpler one

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,680
really actually was an interesting

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,000
discussion with a lot of passion

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,520
and a lot of people um interested in you

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,240
know how we can make fedora

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,720
useful and better for all audiences you

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,960
know not

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,120
not just a specific niche and not just

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,000
and not just the newbie case as well

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,639
like how to make

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
how do we go about making fedora as

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,039
operating systems

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,960
best best for everybody so um i

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,240
i oh yeah i love this slide i'll

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,360
probably post it on twitter

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,000
somewhere because also please do take

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,240
the poll

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,440
in in chat about which is your favorite

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,440
text editor thank you

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,120
all right um the other thing i forgot to

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,120
mention is

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,879
i don't have speaker notes because of

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,319
the way my setup is here

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,160
i couldn't figure out a good way to make

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,479
speaker notes and not share them

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,279
so there's some aspect of slideshow

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,519
karaoke

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,959
going on here a slide will come up and

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,000
then i will talk about it

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,159
there's probably going to be some

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,519
important things that i forget to say

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,959
so when i get to the part where i'm

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,519
talking about like you're part of the

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,320
project

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,160
and i totally miss something i'm sorry

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,800
in advance

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,920
you can feel free to call me out on it

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,160
anyways

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,000
this is a metric slide i've been doing

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,399
for a while i guess

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,560
that uses our fedora messaging data bus

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,720
to kind of get a picture of people's

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,120
activity in the project

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,880
and not all things are hooked up to that

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,720
message bus and in particular this

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,760
actually just looks at three things

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,279
which is changes to packages

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,000
qa feedback in bode and wiki edits

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,000
and it's a graph of basically

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,760
involvement in the project every week

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,160
and the the blue line is

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,920
people who have been lightly involved in

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,880
the last year but have done something

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,440
that week

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,320
and uh then the the solid areas are

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,880
people who

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,760
basically are involved all the time in

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,160
fedora doing

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,000
at least some little thing every week

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,920
and you can see we have a pretty solid

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
core of about 200 people

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,120
and i talked about this before the

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,320
yellow line

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,640
people who are kind of new to the

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,279
project and the green is newcomers who

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,200
are

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,519
now now solidly involved they're not

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,519
just doing one or two things

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,560
and i would love to see those lines be

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,320
thicker but

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,399
as we can also see looking back over the

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,959
past five years we've got

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,399
it's pretty healthy the one thing you

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,240
may notice it seems like there's a

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,440
slight downward trend here this is

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,760
actually a data source

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,600
problem because as we switched from

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,839
emphasizing the wiki to emphasizing the

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,240
docs.fedorproject.org

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,920
wiki edits and and also we had to block

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,279
make wiki editing harder but keep

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,560
spammers away

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,640
wiki edits are way down so that kind of

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,200
makes a slight downward trend overall

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,399
actually it's all pretty flat

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,800
i would would like to see this growing

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,440
but i think overall it's it's pretty

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,959
healthy

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,480
but we can certainly work on getting new

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,560
people in there and um

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,079
over the next year one of my background

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,519
projects in my

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,399
free time is to update this with more

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,079
data sources

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,399
and some kind of hook up to some of our

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,720
new uh things that we have to see what

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,720
other

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,720
other information i can get into here

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,279
uh yeah some some other things that kind

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,200
of show um

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,760
interest in fedora is growing this is

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,279
the fedora magazine page views um we're

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,160
well on track to have

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,360
four million uh visitors or page views

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,640
and visitors

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,480
um this next year which is an amazingly

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,079
huge number like um

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,680
when we started doing the fedora

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,720
magazine and it was just me

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,240
posting a sad article once a week

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,000
i never imagined it would become so

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,760
popular and

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,920
this is really nice because for a while

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,600
we had basically paid red headers

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,760
devoting a portion of their time to

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,640
making sure that the magazine was

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,560
on track and it has largely been

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,680
self-operating and self-running

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,680
from the magazine team by itself for a

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,680
while now and continues to be

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,720
really high quality and increase in

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,920
popularity

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,519
so it's it's a great kind of user

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,519
outreach sort of thing that we have

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:56,399
all right pause for drink

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,560
it's water uh all right

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,079
yeah and another um nice aspect which

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,880
kind of shows our community health this

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,440
is from ask

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,000
fedor ask fedora which is a discussion

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,079
forum

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,160
basically for getting help and it's very

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,560
you know and user focused here

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,639
um can see also this is pretty healthy

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,600
stats across the board here and we're

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,279
actually

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,360
kind of solidly in the middle of the

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,680
enterprise level

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,800
service we're paying for here this is an

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,680
open source hosted

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,200
platform that we are very happy to have

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,680
somebody else run for us

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,320
and help support some other open source

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,240
um it the engagement is pretty good

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,920
and it continues to grow and as a really

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,120
good resource for getting help if you

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,519
have a technical

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,399
problem even if you are a fedora

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,519
contributor

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,639
uh ascadora is a great place to go um

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,240
and if you are someone who's

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,320
knowledgeable about things and have a

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,160
couple minutes to spare every day

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,000
um look there for things that you people

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,639
need help and uh offer offer your

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
assistance

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,279
because it's an easy easy way to give

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,839
back and help help build up the

00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,639
community and get involved and you know

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,279
i know i i've i've done some uh user

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,680
support

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,200
questioning things there's it's a good

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,399
way to make sure that you know what

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,639
you're talking about

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,560
helping helping other people as well so

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,440
it's good for your own growth education

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,040
as well

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,639
as i'm really happy how well this has

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,240
taken off and this is also another

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,560
example of something where

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,279
the community behind askvidora kind of

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,720
came and said

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,639
okay we're going to do this and i

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,880
took it on and made it very successful

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:31,440
so thank you ask fedora people this is

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,519
great um so those are some good things

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,440
this is this is our code of conduct

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:39,120
situation this year

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:42,000
um it's been a tough time

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,040
since um basically since coronavirus hit

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,800
we've had

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,040
um just an onslaught of code of conduct

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,040
tickets um i don't think it's

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,920
necessarily that people in the community

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,279
are behaving

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,839
badly although if things seem a little

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,959
more on

00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,920
edge and we've been getting a lot of

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,920
these requests

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,120
and it's a little sometimes hard those

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,480
requests go to just

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:09,440
marie and to me uh and so we

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,000
work on trying to deal with those um

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,040
that system worked fine when we had

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,680
maybe one code of conduct issue to deal

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,360
with you know every couple months

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,720
it's certainly not scaling we're going

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,320
to need to come up with a

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,079
better solution for this um

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,440
i i think some of it also is that you

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,040
know people are seeing that we're taking

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,199
this seriously and

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,000
i do if you do see something please

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:36,320
please don't hesitate to file a request

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,040
and we'll see what we can we can do but

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,040
i also

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,240
encourage everybody to be charitable

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,600
with each other be

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,720
be loving be friendly and assume the

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,959
best intentions

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,959
and you know work together to resolve

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,839
differences before it gets to the level

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,320
of needing to be a

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,079
code of conduct ticket um we really want

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,360
fedora to be a welcoming

00:14:54,079 --> 00:15:00,959
place for everybody um and

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:05,839
um you know that's it's without that

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:08,399
it we can't work um along those lines uh

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,279
backs before marie and marie have been

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,399
working

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,720
working with red hat legal on an update

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,480
to our code of conduct a pretty

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,920
substantial basically replacing the code

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,920
of conduct with one which has

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,440
a lot more detail and a lot more

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,680
tools for action and a lot more clarity

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,079
about what kind of things

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,440
are and are not you know violations of

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,560
the code of conduct

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,120
um i know it might seem like in the

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
climate

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,079
of the world that this is kind of a

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,000
reactive oh they're doing a code of

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,199
conduct thing that fedora blah blah blah

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,040
it's actually something that's been in

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,920
the works for several years

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,279
because this is really important to

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,480
making fedora

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,399
a successful community and so um watch

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,880
for that coming up we're going to

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,519
want community impact and input and

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,759
feedback

00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,720
into the update on code of conduct as it

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:04,000
comes out um so that'll be coming

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,000
not not too long from now

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,759
um this slide is just a segue because

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,320
we're going from a

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,040
code of conduct to um happier talk

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,839
things

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,199
um i also like that the screen got dark

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,920
when i did that did you see that that's

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,360
because i

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,120
switched and my lighting is mostly

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,639
coming from my screen that's

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:28,079
awesome awesome talking to myself

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:31,279
things all right so uh

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:33,519
back in the days before coronavirus

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,959
some eternity ago but actually not that

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,440
long ago um

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,000
the fedora council had an in-person

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,480
meeting

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,199
in prague where we got together and you

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,360
know in

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,480
close proximity and worked through a

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,360
number of things um

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,480
go to the fedora community blog and you

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,959
can see our

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,959
update from all of those things but one

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,240
of the things we did was write a vision

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,800
statement

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,720
we've been working as a council on

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:03,120
strategy and mission and things

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:05,360
for a while and we didn't really have

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,199
this part of it which is kind of a

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,880
what's our what's our high level like

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,559
what are we trying to do with all this

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,319
not just what are we making but what's

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,000
what's the impact we want to have like

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,640
where what are we really going

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
um and this is what we came up with um i

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,520
think it's pretty good

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,039
um and i think um it it it's a it's a

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
pretty good flag for what we're aiming

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,199
for

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,039
i i kind of thought we'd have something

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,839
a little more grandiose than this but i

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,000
think it

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,679
it it captures what we're going for

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,200
especially in the context of the fedora

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,799
foundations and the mission

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:40,160
and so on and speaking

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,960
of that this is from previous years the

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,640
fedora

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,960
mission statement which i will not read

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,640
aloud because you can read it

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,160
and then also um the previous year

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,400
we came up with this that's basically

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,520
the fedora strategy for delivering on

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,559
that mission

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,280
and one of the things that i think is

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,080
important to highlight here this is a

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,720
refinement

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,200
of the fedora next strategy which we

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,160
launched

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,000
like five years ago where we decided

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,200
that our focus was going to be on

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,440
three fedora editions and um

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,240
and then kind of everything else on on

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,919
the separate

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,080
separate site and that was a very

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,880
successful strategy to see my

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,360
in my slides like when we started that

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,320
fedora growth really took off so

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,679
that was a good approach but partly in

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,679
line with our mission we want to make

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,440
sure that we're also doing a good job to

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,880
support the things that are not

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,480
those main editions it doesn't mean

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,679
we're getting rid of the additions

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,919
at all but the other

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,760
the other things that people make are

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,080
actually very important to what fedora

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,679
is

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,000
as a project and we want to make sure

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,480
those things get the support that they

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,919
need

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,400
and so our strategy that we're working

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,080
on here

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,640
is to focus fedora as an overall thing

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,640
on making sure that we're making the

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,679
tools and you know like

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,120
sets of packages um technologies you

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,000
know modularity is

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,480
intended to be a tool that can make let

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,760
people

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,919
make these solutions for their use cases

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,400
and kind of working on those kind of

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,360
things and i think this has been

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,880
in a lot of ways a success here this

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,840
very beautiful slide is something i

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,080
don't understand

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,600
at all with audio it looks very pretty i

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,960
like the rainbows

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,360
this is the fedora jam spin which

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,080
a community of people been making a foot

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,520
or a

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:37,200
based on another another distribution a

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,200
audio processing music

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,799
handling special purpose distribution

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,559
and

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,840
some of the people working on that you

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,200
know looked at fedora and what we're

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,039
doing and thought hey

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,720
this is actually like this is a project

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,919
that's set up to enable us to do the

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,400
things we need to do

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,919
and uh so we now have the fedora jam

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,919
spin had been kind of sitting there for

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,320
a while it's one of our

00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,960
oldest things in fedora i think actually

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,039
um

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,159
but i had not really been getting a lot

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:05,120
of attention so

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,120
a group of people came in to that and uh

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,720
built up a fedora jam into a

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,120
a pretty neat thing with a

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,440
some a bunch of audio technology that i

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,039
was told about and sounded cool but i

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,799
don't understand but if you

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,960
if you care about these things check it

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,520
out and i think the most important thing

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,960
is

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,159
you know from a project point of view is

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,480
that we're able to support the

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:30,320
development of something like this that

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,320
fits fits that special use case

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,440
and another one is nero fedora which is

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,919
a specialized again

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,480
kind of to a very specialized niche it's

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,600
made for

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,760
neuroscience in uh in

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,640
neuroscience computation with open

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,039
source

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,880
and uh kind of helping to bring open

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,559
source to that community and making open

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,520
source accessible to that area of

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,400
science

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,360
and this has been very successful a lot

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,720
because

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,320
uh it is it's not just the couple of

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,919
people in fedora who are interested in

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,159
neuroscience which we actually

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,240
we do have some but um has brought in

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,080
other open source volunteers

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,440
other scientists who are interested in

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,960
that thing and not necessarily in

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,039
neuroscience per se

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,240
are working on this and they've packaged

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,400
hundreds of

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,679
scientific applications as part of

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:24,640
fedora

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,640
which i used to work at a university and

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,159
i love scientists and i love scientists

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,200
who make

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,200
code but scientists who make codes idea

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,000
of how to put together a software

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,200
package

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,200
is often um

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,440
each each scientist has their own best

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,799
ideas of how to do that

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,320
so um the feat of packaging all this

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,159
stuff into a coherent

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,320
uh distribution is actually really

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,000
useful because um

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,760
it rather than having a bunch of random

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,679
code in lots of different collections

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,640
having that all together is really cool

00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,559
and this is a great example of how

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,840
something like this actually you can

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,000
take this to

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,679
a neuroscience conference and rather

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,559
than just going to conferences

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,240
that are about linux distributions uh

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,559
and talking to other people who already

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,559
are

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,640
talking about linux distributions we can

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:17,440
actually bring fedora we can bring

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,280
open source to other places where people

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,880
might not have that exposure and bring

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,799
them into the fedora community and bring

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,840
them into open source so this is a great

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,520
way

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,760
that to support you know get us to that

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,440
vision and i really like again i

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,039
appreciate the people working on this

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,039
and i i love it so much

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,520
all right um see this is the chat

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,400
roulette part of the

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,200
no the slideshow karaoke that's the one

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,240
of

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,320
this talk dinosaurs this is the

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,679
thing that shows that i'm going to show

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,480
some things from our statistics

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,159
gathering

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:55,200
system coming up um i some of you may

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:58,159
know that we had a new with fedora 32

00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,080
thing called dnf better counting

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,960
basically when your system checks for an

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,280
update

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,159
it now sends once a week a thing that

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,360
says hey

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,159
um count me which lets us get better a

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,640
better picture

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,360
of how people systems are actually

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,240
actually

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,400
out there um under the previous system

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,080
if you are at home behind a router and

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,760
you had 10 systems

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,679
we would see the connection coming from

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,000
that router but we would have no idea if

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,320
you had

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,360
one ten or a thousand systems behind

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,640
that router

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,880
um and also if you like again

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,640
in the before times when going out was a

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,559
thing if you went to like five coffee

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,880
shops a day and did work from all of

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,520
them

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,960
which you know sometimes um work from

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,480
home people do stuff like that to get a

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,679
change of scenery um you might get

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,080
counted five times

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,200
so that would like weird counting so we

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,840
have a new system

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,320
that is meant to count things better but

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,360
as the dinosaur shows here like

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,320
it's uh this is a brontosaurus

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,480
which for many years was lumped in with

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,880
the apatosaurus

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,600
because of bone confusion because it's

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,039
hard to

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,039
just looking digging through dinosaur

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,960
bones figure out what parts go to what

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,600
and how things all fit together

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,799
our stat collection is kind of like that

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,360
we do not

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,039
do really invasive tracking we do not

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,120
have like monitoring keystrokes or

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:20,640
anything like that in fedora and

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,240
we never will um so um the consequence

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,720
of that our ability to see what's going

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,799
on

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,279
is a little bit more like you know

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:30,880
dinosaur fossil digging than it is

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:32,799
um like a controlled experiment so

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,480
all that is to say all of the data i'm

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,559
about to show comes with some bunch of

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,000
caveats which we call the

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:42,000
dinosaurs um and velociraptors and other

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,360
monsters

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,400
but uh here we go so this is

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,200
uh fedora 32 from the old counting

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,159
method where we

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,279
observe ip addresses and here is the

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,120
data from

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,039
uh the new counting system for fedora

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,159
32. we only have it for fedora 32

00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,440
because that's where we started so i

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,799
can't go back

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,640
you can see right away there are some

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,720
dinosaur bites out of here that's

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,159
probably data center move problems where

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,080
we lost a little bit

00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,760
but the curve is basically the same

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,720
going back forward

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,360
um but one thing i should draw your

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,320
attention to

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,640
is the axis over here where on the old

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,480
one

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,320
it goes up to about a hundred thousand

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:24,240
on the new one it's actually about

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,919
double um which uh we went and looked

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,919
back at the data coming in

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,520
and will woods thank you very much for

00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,000
doing this and for setting up the whole

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,919
system

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,279
in the back end and thank you to the dnf

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,760
team of course for implementing this in

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,760
dnf

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:43,840
matthew lost some internet connectivity

00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:51,760
[Music]

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,000
i've always wanted to have my cat in the

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,960
state of fedora here she is

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,039
our new data collection system um does

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,440
not expose personal information

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,320
um it doesn't even give ip addresses to

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,480
me it is

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,440
um and it puts everything into the

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,159
aggregate

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,919
um but it does uh include the release

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,799
name of the operating system from etsy

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,440
os release

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,960
and also the variant which be if you're

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,840
running fedora kde

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,400
or fedora workstation or fedora server

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,039
it will

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,400
um it will say so which is what i'm

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,799
going to show in a little bit

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,200
um for the for the different um things i

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:30,320
just showed i actually only looked at

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,919
fedora and i'm actually only looking at

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,520
things that were hitting the fedora

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,039
updates released repository um which

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,440
um i've talked with will woods who

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,480
helped this set this up and actually

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,080
there's a

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,919
more complicated way to just actually

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,840
make sure we're checking excuse me all

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,840
the fedora repositories that we are

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,240
looking at and getting the maximum value

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,039
gives us a slightly better number

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,360
with this one i do the simple approach

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,200
um

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,720
yeah so i was just looking at fedora but

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,799
as we were looking through the data

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,880
um there are a lot of funny things in

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:03,039
here i i've highlighted some of them

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,039
um you know fedora remix for wsl it's

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:08,559
nice to see that that's being used

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:10,320
um fedora someone uh

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,840
editing this thing by themselves and

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,000
typos i guess

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,200
um i think my favorite one might be red

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,520
hat with no space

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,399
like you're not fooling anybody um there

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,600
this that's

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:23,679
that that's not red hat yeah um

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,440
but we also obviously see um connections

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,440
from from rel where people are doing

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,880
some fedora probably building packages

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,840
um and those kind of things um but

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,159
uh anyways i thought this was kind of

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,000
fun

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,760
and some of these actually are fedora

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,799
remixes and are actually completely

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,679
legitimate um

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,679
things like um

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,000
i i'm not sure which ones to call out

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,679
but yeah actual actual fedora remixes

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,520
that are part of you know that mission

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,720
of making fedora easy to make make a

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,159
solution for

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,240
is actually being shown here in the

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,480
things that people make

00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,480
um

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:05,360
so uh this also um lets me uh

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,159
look and see what different things

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,600
people are

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:12,320
using like which fedora outputs are

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,120
are actually reflected in in people's

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,360
usage

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,159
um and here we can see uh the breakdown

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,320
here

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,960
now unfortunately not all of our spins

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,360
and labs

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,360
things are updated to actually have the

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,960
the release information here

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,360
um so i have a big unknown check section

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,200
here

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,039
um that will also in the future people

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,159
if they do a generic install that is

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,559
actually not

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,080
either an addition or a spin um will

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,159
also show up there but that should be a

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,120
much smaller sliver of things in the

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,080
future so

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,720
we'll get more data as we go um as you

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,080
can see

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,840
um workstation is um as expected the

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:53,279
pretty big chunk of this

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:55,279
um but we've got a a sizable serve

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,440
chunk of people using fedora as a server

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,200
here and server and cloud together make

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,480
up you know 12 percent of this

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,880
and notably uh

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,679
this system does not count anything that

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,120
uses os

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,559
tree which is our kind of new way of

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,240
putting together an operating system so

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,320
that means silver blue

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,279
uh the iot edition which we'll talk

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,399
about a little bit

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:19,200
uh and um

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,799
uh core os fedora core os are not shown

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,679
at all in here and

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,559
um i know that core os is uh there's a

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,240
lot of core os

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,480
out there a lot of fedora koros and

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,320
there is a lot of fedora iot

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,600
and i know that i don't know the numbers

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,279
for silver blue but i know there's a lot

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,200
of enthusiasm about it so

00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,880
there's some missing wedges as well but

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,799
other and we're going to try and figure

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,600
out how to get those into the same kind

00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:43,039
of data view

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:47,279
but um so this is kind of an interesting

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:47,279
breakdown here um

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,000
yeah um so that's here's this view of

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,799
this again this is just a fedora

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,360
32 and i just looked in june and july

00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,399
for

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,240
for those numbers here it'll be

00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,360
interesting to see how these things

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,000
evolve here

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,760
um if there's some there were a couple

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,559
others that are reported um like there's

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,080
xfce

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,159
shows up in the data but it's actually

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,760
much less than one percent

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,919
i'm actually not quite sure what's going

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,640
on there because i think xfce is more

00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,200
popular

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,919
than than like a tiny fraction of one

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,760
percent

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:24,080
um it might be that um xft users

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,520
have been xfce users for so long that

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,159
they're all upgrading and

00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,640
are still in the um non they don't have

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,679
that identity file on their system

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:36,080
um i'm not sure um

00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,279
so another thing that this nuke system

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,279
does is tell us

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,120
how old the system is or basically how

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:44,080
long since it's been installed

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,200
um and this is that same um total graph

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,520
with the breakdown

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,120
of of those numbers and one of the

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,760
interesting things we can see about this

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,720
is like a lot of times systems are just

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,559
transient there

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,320
may be people install it for a test or

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:59,679
it's part of a ci system

00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,440
or it's part of um you know a cloud

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,279
server that doesn't last very long or it

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,080
is a container um yeah going back here

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,240
you can see that

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,760
container usage is actually four percent

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,559
of the systems here

00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,000
um and which is also impressive because

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,720
that means somebody did something

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,200
with dnf in a container uh you're not no

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,399
no

00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,760
you don't normally have a container

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,360
that's sitting there running doing

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,799
metadata refreshes and things that would

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,159
cause the data that they hit

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:27,440
so that's pretty significant but

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,960
uh in the future when i have more data

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,440
i'm going to do some fun things with

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,159
flow

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,159
from one version to the next or one

00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,240
month cohort here to the next

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,080
um but for right now i just kind of have

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,000
this breakdown and what i did is i took

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,080
this and i just looked at the systems

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,679
that are not in the just brand new

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,440
install but the ones that have been

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,840
around for at least a week

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,480
and so this lets us look at basically

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,519
you know

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,120
if it lasted longer than a week

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,799
hopefully it's a real install and not

00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,120
something that was just a throwaway test

00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,760
or

00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,720
a short lived instance here and as you

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,799
can expect

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,120
the results are about the same but much

00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,679
less cloud and almost no container

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,159
there so that's kind of interesting it's

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,840
actually

00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,200
almost less interesting than i thought

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,880
it would be which uh

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,880
i i guess that's that's always a good

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,039
result as well when it comes right down

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,399
to it um

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,159
another thing i wanted to call here is

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,720
this is from um

00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,080
yeah five years ago i did try to do the

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,840
same kind of estimation

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,440
using download statistics from get

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,960
fedora which

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,480
i don't think are as good as running

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,840
system statistics because

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,519
you know you can download something and

00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,840
never use it and so on

00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,080
um but actually the the slices are kind

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,120
of about the same the one thing is

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:43,279
mate is way up and xfce

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,640
down but again uh the overall picture

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,799
is kind of similar so i thought that was

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,360
kind of interesting

00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,559
um since the new system only is for

00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,039
fedora 32

00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,960
um this is the the old data um that kind

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:57,279
of shows all fedora that it's reporting

00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,799
and going back to the beginning of time

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:03,440
in you know 2007 uh

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:05,600
and this shows again the overall upward

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,159
trend and like i said i think fedora is

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,600
very successfully growing um again i've

00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,000
always told people don't pay much

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,840
attention

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,519
to the numbers on the axis there it's

00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,760
the trend that's interesting

00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,880
um i think the new system will let us

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,880
pay a little more attention to the

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,760
numbers even if it isn't complete but i

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,919
think um

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,640
you know this shows us that probably

00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:27,440
almost a million fedora systems

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,519
running out there which is which is cool

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,799
we're having a lot of impact

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:35,840
and speaking of impact fedoras apple

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:37,279
extra packages to run on centos and rel

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,720
and other enterprise distributions

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,440
continues to also

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,440
be a monstrous success with basically an

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,519
exponential growth curve

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,960
very cool i think we started noticing

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,960
this somewhere in the middle of the

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,000
graph like

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,000
where 2013 2014

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,360
is like wow this is this is kind of

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,840
getting to be a big thing

00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,720
um look how big it's gotten since then

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:04,640
so this is an example of where

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,240
fedora where you have impact even beyond

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,760
the fedora distribute even even if

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,119
making the thorough distribution is what

00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,200
you care about

00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,560
the impact you have goes out to all

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,399
these other systems in the world and

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,359
it's really makes a big difference in

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:19,280
getting software out to people so very

00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:22,240
cool

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,000
um yeah all right so again uh slides

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,599
jumping forward this is kind of a

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,200
section where we're going to update do a

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,599
quick update on some of our

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,960
different uh releases and some of the

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,879
different things we're putting out

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,399
obviously some pretty big news from a

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:37,599
workstation

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,480
where we're actually going to be any day

00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,720
now

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,320
lenovo on their regular website where

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,919
you just go to buy a computer and you

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,240
choose your operating system right next

00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:46,720
to

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,760
your windows options there will be i

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,960
would like this to be shipped with

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,480
fedora which is

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,560
the first time a vendor this big has

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,040
shipped a linux operating system

00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,760
in a way like this because although

00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,119
there have been

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,079
you know you can get rel you can get

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,000
ubuntu um as corporate purchases

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,359
and you can get developer edition your

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,800
laptop with linux

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:09,119
and obviously there's a lot of small

00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,720
vendors who've been doing a great job of

00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,119
supporting linux on

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,480
laptops for years this is the first time

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,880
you can just go to the commodity

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,800
consumer page and just be like yeah i'd

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,240
like a footwear operating system

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,000
um yeah um

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,280
ben says in the comments there he hopes

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,040
it's not any day now

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:31,760
um yeah i think it will be um mark

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,880
has uh from lenovo is has a session i

00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,400
think tomorrow

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,720
um we'll give some more details and

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,599
hopefully some exciting news there

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,800
i do he said i could share one bit of

00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,200
exciting news

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,680
um lenovo is going to extend their

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,240
employee discount which i understand to

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,440
be actually

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,280
meaningful not just a little token uh to

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,520
all fedora contributors so if you are a

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,800
fedora contributor and need a new laptop

00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,960
you will be able to get one

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,000
at a discount uh mark will hopefully

00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,800
have some details

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,560
of that um so i think that's a pretty

00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,320
nice thing that lenovo is doing

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,160
to help give back to the community

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:10,240
that's making this operating system

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:12,640
um so yeah that's very cool

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,960
um i also mentioned before fedora core

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,680
os i don't know uh if everybody has been

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,359
following this but you know red hat

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,560
bought core os the company

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:25,680
a few years ago and as part of that

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,000
um the underlying operating system some

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,079
of it got integrated into openshift as a

00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,839
feature of openshift that's the product

00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,480
side but on the open source community

00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,400
side

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,839
uh we have fedora core os and there's

00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,560
been actually a lot of exciting

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,640
developments

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,079
in that recently and it kind of took a

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,560
while for it to get off

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,040
and get find its footing but uh this is

00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,520
a now a really solid container operating

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,160
system

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:51,040
okd the open source upstream for

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,720
openshift now runs on fedora core os

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,640
um and you can kind of see we have the

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,320
different stable testing next stream if

00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,560
you if you haven't looked at coreos

00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,760
in a while um it's definitely time to

00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,880
give it a look this is

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,960
um there's talks coming up on this um

00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,160
and i mentioned earlier that we didn't

00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,480
have you know this

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,520
same statistics for this but i saw on

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,320
twitter that uh

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,280
cern the scientific computing um you

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,800
know

00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,200
where they've got the super collider and

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,920
all that stuff they're running over 5000

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,359
instances

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,359
of core fedora core os which is

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,800
uh yeah that's pretty exciting so this

00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,040
is being you know used in

00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,160
real production use for real science in

00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,200
the real world

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,200
uh awesome

00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:36,480
uh fedora iot is also going

00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,320
it's exciting since we're actually

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,079
promoting this to edition this is the

00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,000
first time we've promoted something to

00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:46,079
an addition that wasn't just kind of

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,920
replacing a previous uh iteration

00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,280
and so we are developing a process for

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,599
that um

00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,200
this is a picture of a raspberry pi i

00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,920
think one of the things we

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:58,240
is kind of a cry for help here peter

00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,839
robinson does a huge amount personally

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,880
of the enablement of different arm

00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,880
devices

00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,960
and if you are using arm and it's

00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,320
working you pretty much have peter to

00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,839
thank for it

00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,680
as as well as obviously a lot of other

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,800
people but peter's just done a huge

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,680
amount um

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,480
and the raspberry pi is a constant pain

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,320
for him

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,160
if you are interested in making the

00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,800
raspberry pi work

00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,680
come help fedora fedora do this better

00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,440
because

00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,839
peter could use some help especially as

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,520
we go to make a fedora iot an official

00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,800
edition and kind of one of our top level

00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,680
things

00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,240
which i'm very excited about because iot

00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,680
is a

00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:37,599
great like way you can get a hands-on

00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,040
experience with computing and kind of do

00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,359
things uh

00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,200
that have an actual you know impact you

00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,520
can you can make something that actually

00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,440
connects with the real world which is

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,280
kind of computing at its most fun

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,119
i think and i think it's really nice for

00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,240
fedora to be at the forefront of that

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:57,920
and the fedora iot operating system

00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:59,760
is again it uses os tree and is

00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,920
uh there's really nothing like it out

00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,000
there and i think it's one of one of the

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,440
best operating systems for iot in the

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,240
world and it's really cool to see that

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,280
coming from

00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,280
you know fedora project

00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:15,760
this is a sad puppy it is fedora server

00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,359
i had mentioned earlier that fedora

00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,320
server um actually is a pretty

00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:21,520
significant

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:24,640
um chunk of our our user base

00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,240
um and um it kind of unlike the fedora

00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,720
cloud

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,000
has not been get like it doesn't have

00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,839
the project

00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,920
interest behind it that i think it

00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,680
deserves because of its use case

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,200
so this is something i can talk at

00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,920
length about but

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,800
um i i would really like to see fedora

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,040
server

00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,440
working group get revitalized and i

00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,359
don't have great ideas for that but

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,000
i know a lot of you here are using

00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:51,839
fedora in a server capacity

00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,839
we should talk about how we can make

00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:56,160
that that group functional again

00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:58,160
and so we can help develop fedora server

00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,560
uh in a way that helps serve the users

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,000
and

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,160
who are who are interested in using

00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,079
fedora that way um and let's make this

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,160
to be a happy puppy with a

00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,960
love loving home rather than a sad

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,960
lonely puppy

00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,040
all right here we go um now you might

00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,680
think wow fedora's making a laser tag

00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,359
edition

00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,440
um now this is i'm switching from

00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:19,520
talking about technical things here

00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,040
um this is actually a picture to remind

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,599
me of a mistake

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,839
i made as fedor project leader early on

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,280
that i think caused a lot of damage and

00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:31,359
i'm sorry about

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,960
and that is uh the fedora ambassadors

00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:36,160
group in europe

00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,040
wanted to have a laser tag event as part

00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,920
of their

00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,400
annual meet up and planning session and

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,720
i

00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,000
was very concerned about impact on our

00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,280
budget and i

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,839
said whoa whoa laser tag that sounds

00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,000
crazy

00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,599
crazy and not like technical why don't

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,079
you you know have a nice lunch or

00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,880
something

00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,839
and talk about nerdy stuff and not not

00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,880
have fun

00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:00,960
um and that was very wrong i

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,880
i think i did a lot of damage with that

00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,520
and i'm sorry i'm not just the laser tag

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,720
in

00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:10,400
specific but getting teams together

00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:13,359
to do fun things is uh has a huge

00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,880
impact and we should do more of it so if

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:17,440
you want your team to do

00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,119
laser tag please put in a funding

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,760
request we will

00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:23,200
we will support your fun things because

00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,800
um you know again

00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,720
in the future when it doesn't have to be

00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,480
masked socially distance laser tag

00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,000
laser tag is a terrible idea right now

00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,280
don't do laser tag right now

00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,319
um in the future um

00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,720
so uh these kind of social events are

00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:39,200
really

00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,480
like the glue that makes our community

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,280
work and

00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,160
um as as we get back into the world

00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,920
functioning again

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,520
i really hope we can do a lot more

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,400
social events

00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,680
and i hope that can be feed into on the

00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,400
thing that this slide is really supposed

00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,720
to be about

00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,640
which is uh marie and the mindshare

00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,800
committee have been working on

00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,760
rebuilding the fedora ambassadors kind

00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,119
of our outreach

00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,800
arm which had you know for for the last

00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,680
few years really been

00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,560
um wandering in the wilderness and i

00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,480
hope that um

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,319
social events and some things with you

00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,359
know the diversity and inclusion team

00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:18,079
and the join team um can we can we can

00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,520
kind of build up the ambassadors again

00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,319
and

00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,640
help spread fedora to more people and

00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,280
have

00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,960
a lot more fun and community building uh

00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,720
together

00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,560
um yeah i mentioned diversity inclusion

00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,280
and they join sig these are two groups

00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,079
that are doing

00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,680
um awesome work in fedora um the

00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,319
diversity inclusion group

00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,480
you can is working on making fedora be a

00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:42,480
welcoming place for everybody

00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,000
uh they've run the fedora women's days

00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,680
which have been a huge success

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,000
all around the world um you know

00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,720
a dozen events every year where people

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,240
get together

00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,000
and you know learn about fedora and

00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:57,200
share and help build community

00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,520
and kind of another group that makes it

00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,880
easy to get into fedora the join sig

00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:04,079
like i said at the beginning

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,960
like this is a huge messy project and

00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,960
the join sig

00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,720
is a friendly place where you can say i

00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,480
i'd like to get involved i'd like to

00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,359
help but i don't know what to do

00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,880
you could have somebody say welcome i

00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,160
will help you i will show you what the

00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,440
i'll show you the beginnings of the

00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,760
ropes and uh

00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,280
this is something also that i want to

00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,920
invest more in i want to invest more in

00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,640
mentoring

00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,640
in fedora in building up people who are

00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,240
able to support newcomers and support

00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,240
people into the project because you know

00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,480
we are a 17 year old project

00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,400
and we want to make sure that we

00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,640
continue to be welcoming and continue to

00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,400
grow and continue to have

00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,319
the information that we know passed

00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,640
along to the next generation of fedora

00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,640
people

00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,480
uh and okay so this is this is a picture

00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,400
of fun

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,680
another thing that's been great success

00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,440
over the past

00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,520
few months during current virus time

00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,560
we've been doing fedora social hours

00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,640
once a week this is a picture of the

00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,920
fedora social hour in mozilla hubs

00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,920
virtual reality

00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,359
we're actually having a session of this

00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,400
during during this conference you can

00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,240

headset

00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,839
um we've been doing this every week

00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:21,520
getting together and just chatting

00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:25,839
mostly about non-non-work things

00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,839
but sometimes we talked about butter fs

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,280
but most mostly about non-work things um

00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,800
wait i want to go back to the

00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,359
workstation slide because i forgot

00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,520
something

00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:37,200
which was beyond lenovo i got so excited

00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,920
about lenovo i wanted to also talk about

00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,480
how um

00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,640
i excited them about how uh that the

00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,839
discussion slide at the beginning about

00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:49,440
uh compressed compressed swap and uh

00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:51,359
text editors and so on actually is uh

00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,200
a really amazing example of how well

00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:54,960
that group is working and i'm excited

00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,480
about all the features that are coming

00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,359
from that team that are just kind of

00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,839
focusing on

00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:00,880
what users need and making pushing

00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:03,440
fedora to be

00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,720
a better experience fedora's operating

00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,160
systems to be a better

00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,160
experience for users and to

00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,359
look at innovation and growing things

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,040
forward i'm a little bit scared about

00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:14,560
this butterfest change because file

00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,480
system changes are scary

00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,480
but i think it's exciting and i think

00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,920
it's really neat to see how that was

00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,000
that discussion went i was very

00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,560
community-led and we came to a community

00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,119
decision

00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,079
on it i think that's uh functioning very

00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,839
well so

00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,680
good good job everybody on that and

00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,280
looking forward to seeing how all that

00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:34,560
plays out

00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,680
into our glorious future um i just put

00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,839
these slides together

00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,520
you know fairly recently marie had

00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,960
promised me pretty pictures and i said

00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,480
awesome i'll take you up on that and

00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,839
then i was way too late to get pretty

00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,680
pictures so

00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:47,680
when i talk about the future here we're

00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:50,560
going to be just looking at words

00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,560
um you know what what we want back back

00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,760
to the vision uh what where we're trying

00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,520
to go for so i

00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:59,599
i think um that fedora our mission

00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,520
is is to build this operating system for

00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,880
people but our vision is that through

00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,480
this operating system

00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,400
we will bring more open source to more

00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,400
people and i think that in the next few

00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,200
years we're going to do an amazing job

00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,440
through you know

00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,640
these different uh outputs we have and

00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,680
through our building our growing our

00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,720
community

00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,960
more open source for everybody awesome

00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,400
i really think that we are one of the

00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,880
great communities

00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,040
in like in the internet and the world

00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,599
fedora has been an example of community

00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,640
building

00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,680
and friendship um and i hope we can

00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,520
continue

00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:34,000
i know we can continue to do that and

00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,359
grow and you know adapt to new things

00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,720
and adapt to new technologies for

00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:39,760
communication

00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,680
and uh you know just the way

00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,480
the way the world is continuing to work

00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,359
together in a positive way virtually you

00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,680
know i think that we

00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:51,599
can make a big example for uh people who

00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,040
now are working from home that are you

00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,560
know not used to doing this kind of

00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,640
online collaboration we've been doing it

00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,480
forever we know we know what we're doing

00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,560
and we can be a way you can show the

00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,359
world how to how to do community well i

00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,599
think that's

00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:04,720
an amazing thing um i think we'll

00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,400
continue to make this

00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,839
great toolkit for putting together

00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,400
solutions

00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:11,440
and we'll have better tooling better

00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,720
better features for

00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:17,280
doing all those things um i think

00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,160
a lot of the things with like the source

00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,920
disc to get

00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:23,760
uh thing and you know refined modularity

00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,200
uh os build for putting together

00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,720
different spins um

00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,880
some exciting things we're working on

00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,800
are coming up i think that's very cool

00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,559
um and i you know i think fedora will

00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,000
continue to be the go-to for operating

00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:35,359
system innovation if you want to do

00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,960
something new with an operating system

00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:38,640
if you got a great new idea like

00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,599
fedora should be the place to do it

00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,880
first and of course the spoiler here is

00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,880
we actually do have

00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,040
some graphics for this because these

00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,680
things that are our future are also our

00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,200
fedora

00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:53,359
foundations so um i think

00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,400
it all it's all coming together nicely

00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,480
and um

00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,240
i'm very happy with the state of fedora

00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,000
right now i'm feeling really optimistic

00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,839
about our project our people our

00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,880
community uh

00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:07,280
fedora is good everybody should

00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,640
celebrate and here i am talking about it

00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,119
to an empty room

00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,079
um i have no idea what time it is or how

00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:14,559
much time i've left

00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:18,240
very little because of the downtime um

00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:21,680
but maybe i can do a few questions marie

00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:24,240
hey hi am i i'm on

00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,760
i think i'm good i hear you so there

00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,960
weren't any questions there's

00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:32,800
plenty of fedora plus pluses right now

00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:36,720
um and this discussion a few

00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:39,760
impromptu games um

00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,839
and i've been making plenty of polls as

00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:45,359
you've been talking so if anyone

00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:47,920
has any questions now's the time

00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:48,960
on the state of fedora i am watching the

00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:52,319
chat

00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:54,240
yeah we got some more fedora plus plus

00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:56,319
i see justin saying he remembers the

00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:59,359
2017 talk where it was

00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:01,520
dumpster file fires um yeah

00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:03,040
this is a hard time to be optimistic

00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,599
let's be honest um

00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:07,680
and so i am actually really glad that

00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,000
fedora gives me so much to be optimistic

00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,280
we

00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,559
have a question okay a question who says

00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:18,000
so vim or nano all right

00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:21,119
so i i i'm a systems administrator so i

00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,240
am familiar with them but it is not a

00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,880
good

00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,520
writing program it's a great editor if

00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,359
you have

00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,040
some like a config file you want to

00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,680
change a word in or change a bunch of

00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,720
values

00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,440
excellent it is not functional i i love

00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,760
you all

00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,960
what a terrible thing for writing it's

00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,319
got modes

00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:43,920
that is not a good idea oh awful

00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:45,040
um but i personally as you may guess

00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,720
from my um

00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:51,839
very unbiased poll um i am a user of joe

00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,720
it's a beautiful editor it uh it's got

00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:56,559
its quirks

00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:58,640
but uh it it does its job very nicely

00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,800
cool so we're actually technically

00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,240
overtime by five minutes

00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,480
but i'm just going to quickly say the

00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:07,599
next half an hour is

00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:10,319
um time to hang out in the social area

00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:12,160
the chat room look at the polls you

00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,640
could suggest some more polls for us to

00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,880
put up

00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,880
if you want to direct message me that um

00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:20,000
and also the sponsor

00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,280
booth area so you can go there and some

00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,599
of our sponsors have

00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,960
a couple people showing up to hang out

00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:27,359
in those rooms

00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,040
so there's some videos and stuff there

00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:31,040
too to see i think

00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:33,119
go ahead all right first of all i see

00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,559
people taking issue in the chat with my

00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:37,119
uh characterization of

00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:38,400
them which i uh will will admit to being

00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:42,319
horribly unfair

00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:45,040
uh all editors are great

00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:46,720
everybody loves them i i can i can i can

00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:49,200
use emacs i can use vim

00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,880
it's okay um someone also asks about

00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,000
making fedora server group more

00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:56,319
functional

00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,880
i think the basic thing is um

00:50:56,319 --> 00:51:00,160
we had a hard time finding kind of a

00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,359
flagship feature

00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,480
to to um be exciting about fedora server

00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:06,559
and this has actually been a problem

00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,520
going back to the very first fedora

00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:10,319
conference

00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:12,319
on the one of the fud cons in boston

00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:15,280
where we talked about you know

00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:17,119
about making uh making a fedora server

00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,960
and nobody could agree on what the

00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,440
features are for a fedora server and

00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,200
that problem has persisted

00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,280
but i think also a lot of it just fell

00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,240
on one person on stephen gallagher thank

00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,079
you stephen

00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,240
to kind of do that and it just kind of

00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:33,280
leads to burnout when it's one person

00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:35,119
so i kind of having a functional group

00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,000
that meets every couple weeks to talk

00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,079
about the project

00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,119
and what needs to be done is kind of the

00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:42,079
baseline

00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:43,680
um of just uh having a meeting group

00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:45,839
that multiple people show up to with

00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,119
interest in this to discuss the project

00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:48,880
is kind of the first thing i think that

00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:52,319
needs to happen um

00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:53,440
and on another practical note uh we made

00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:56,480
a decision

00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:59,040
last year to merge fedora cloud

00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,599
uh off the fedor cloud image with fedora

00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,480
server

00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:04,319
because um kind of like what marie is

00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,440
doing with the website's team and the

00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:07,760
marketing team

00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,800
when you have uh two teams where it's

00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,599
just one person

00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,319
feeling desperately alone uh and not

00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,319
connected

00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:15,920
it would be better even if they they

00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:17,760
seem like they're a little bit distinct

00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,839
it's better to put things into one

00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:22,880
functioning team with actual teammates

00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:25,599
than it is to have a a lonely

00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,079
person fighting by themselves so um but

00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,760
um

00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,440
doing that actually takes some work so

00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,359
that's kind of maybe a first step i

00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,079
would suggest that a revitalized team

00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:35,359
would take on

00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:36,160
is to get the cloud and server images

00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:38,559
together into

00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,839
one foot or a server for clouds or

00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:43,359
whatever we want to call it

00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:44,880
a thing yes

00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:46,319
steven says in the comments talking

00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,839
about it is good but we also actually

00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:49,280
need people to actually do that

00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:51,520
actual work of putting the things

00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:54,240
together but um honestly

00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,720
start with the discussion um and then

00:52:54,240 --> 00:53:00,800
the work

00:52:54,720 --> 00:53:02,640
the work can follow

00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,480
cool i don't see any more questions in

00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,040
the chat for now

00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,079
matthew ready to wrap up i guess it

00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,760
feels like there should be some

00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:12,400
questions come on i didn't answer

00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,400
everything did

00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,960
uh i gather your questions for the

00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:20,400
closing remarks

00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,720
we can someone ask what what the secret

00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,440
f

00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:25,200
is what's the skill set for working on

00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:28,720
the server cloud images

00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:31,359
um the skill set needed for that uh

00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,160
this is probably a a better separate

00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:35,280
discussion but

00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,960
um some packaging ability um you know

00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,400
knowing how to be assisted men is

00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,720
probably helpful

00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,000
um but packaging ability maybe annoying

00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:45,040
some ansible

00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,440
um those kind of things you know knowing

00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,640
git

00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,599
um there are things you can pick up

00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,400
pretty easily

00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:54,240
