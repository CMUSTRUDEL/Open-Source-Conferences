	00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,040
so here's what i'm going to do

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,639
i'm going to share my screen um

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,639
i guess it's like hard to know like you

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,599
can't talk to people like i want to know

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,599
you know

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,120
who here is completely brand new and

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,039
needs help like

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,960
just getting set up getting inkscape

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,160
running that kind of thing

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,000
um so i'm just going to assume everybody

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,680
watching has inkscape

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,640
so i'll make that assumption and then

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,519
what i'm going to do is i'm going to

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,000
screen share

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,279
oops that's not screen share this is

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,559
screen share

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,559
um i hope this works hi guys

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,960
so technically i didn't finish up the

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,079
thing but i felt like i wanted to

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,840
to join the call here to to populate it

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,680
a little bit more i'm listening and

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,239
okay i'm i'm going to be a part of the

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,520
conversation i just need to

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,440
get gather all of the fast accounts to

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,559
to do badges i'm going to award them

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,440
later i just have to

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,640
go through the chat so i'm here all

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,120
right

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,799
all right thank you for uh saving me

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,520
from being very awkward

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,600
um so all right so we have two

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,880
wallpapers we gotta do

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,720
and the background here is that um

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,799
we're trying to do two release

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,000
wallpapers at the same time

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,880
so we can get ahead of it so that moving

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,960
forward

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,040
we don't block any releases not that we

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,240
ever have although we've been accused of

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,200
doing so um

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,799
but it kind of it means it just means

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,640
less stress for everybody and better

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,200
testing on the wallpaper and that sort

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,920
of thing

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,360
so we're gonna try to get ahead of it so

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,479
we're doing two at once

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,520
and f33 um

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,799
i believe is walter lincoln hawkins and

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,560
this is the one we have

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,840
a lot of mock-ups for um using telephone

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,040
poles

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,640
and i think oh um it looks like madeline

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,240
didn't post her so let me

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,240
hers is in her blog i don't know if you

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,840
guys have seen her

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,159
um blog on planet fedora

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,880
did this why is this not awesome bars

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,880
not being awesome

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,840
yeah okay so

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,720
let me see if i can get her sketches

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,599
here you guys could see this right i'm

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,680
not like

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,280
talking to a black hole yeah

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,360
it's like one of like four things on the

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,920
screen but yeah i can see it

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,720
it's more tough oh i wonder if i can i

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,200
make it

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,040
bigger oh here i think i think we have

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,640
the ability to do that oh

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,080
i think we have to do it independently

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,040
on our side

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,840
so like oh yeah yeah if i double click

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,200
on your

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,440
shared screen then it makes it larger

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,000
and it puts everybody else to the bottom

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,680
okay cool yeah so everyone double click

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,080
oh my gosh and then it does that weird

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,920
thing

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,840
cool all right so yeah i i kind of gave

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,640
madeline a little bit of the background

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,120
of like

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,840
if it's not blue there's drama so you

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,680
see

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,120
i know suggesting more than blue is

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,879
controversial um

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,720
but like this was this was like her

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,640
sketch um

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,879
and i think this she's playing a

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,720
transparency he's like panes of glass um

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,319
i think that was thinking about

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,400
the um the other one the f-34 which is

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,680
boob i works whose name i'm probably

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,599
pitching um

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,599
but he's the guy who invented the

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,040
multiplane camera

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,040
um so i think that that's where she was

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,480
going with this one um

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,680
but this one now so okay i'm gonna i'm

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,040
gonna be blunt here

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,280
all right nobody nobody get your

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,519
feelings here i think these are awesome

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,280
i think i i love how this one like the

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,959
lines pop out of the background that

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,720
makes it a little bit more surreal a

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,000
little bit more abstract i find that

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,560
super interesting

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,920
um when it's just like a telephone pole

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,280
and lines

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,959
it it just it feels um there's like this

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,879
terrible movie that came out

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,799
in the 90s i don't remember the name of

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,080
the movie but it was like this guy going

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,720
to art school

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,480
and he had like he had a thing where

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,640
he'd like just make nouns

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,720
so it just it makes me think of like

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,159
this is just like a noun telephone pole

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,280
do you know what i mean like it needs a

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,760
little bit more something

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,000
so like out of these my favorite mock-up

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,640
is this one because you have the poles

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,519
almost like coming out of the background

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,560
it makes me think of um

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:22,240
oh what's her name the the crazy chick

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,640
um the bad guy chick what's her name um

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,000
um

00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:28,560
[Music]

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,919
yes billy eilish when the beginning of

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,520
the music video and she like

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,120
there's like a yellow thing and she just

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,800
like cracks it open and like

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,320
comes out of it this is what it makes me

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,680
think of it's like a

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,520
like a blue wall and it's just like

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,120
coming out it just it it's interesting

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,720
like you're thinking about

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,520
why is that coming out of the wall it's

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,919
kind of cool so i like that part of it

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,759
um one of the things conceptually that i

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,960
was thinking about with this thing

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,600
was um almost like

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,160
the the entire project that this

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,639
inventor

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,560
worked on involved connecting rural

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,160
communities that never had a connection

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,440
before like they never had the ability

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,320
to call the rest of the country or

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,000
whatnot

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,199
so you know you could even do something

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,360
more abstract that had some sort of like

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,240
networking or like bringing dots

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,639
together or just any sort of like

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,120
visual that shows things that were like

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,320
disconnected kind of flowing together

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,199
so i mean just very abstract concept

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,880
there like that's

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,560
kind of my initial so i wasn't expecting

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,560
anything quite so literal

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,320
as like telephone poles but again like

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,560
this one is kind of cool because it has

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,440
that like surreal edge to it

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,800
um and let me think what else was i

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,199
going to point out about this

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,919
all right so there was a question about

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,960
um

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,960
and let me can i hide my share um

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,919
no go away sure

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,120
there we go okay so then there was a

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,919
question in the ticket

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,919
about um how does this time of day

00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,919
wallpaper thing work

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,199
um so the way the time of day wallpaper

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,520
thing works is

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,120
kind of not as exciting as it sounds

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,360
like it could be

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,160
it's basically like you have four layers

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,960
in

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,759
and you just sort of like blend between

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,759
two layers

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,120
by kind of gradually decreasing the

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,560
opacity of one

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,720
so if objects move from one frame to

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,400
another frame to another frame

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,600
i don't think it's going to work too

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,800
well because then you're going to have

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,680
this thing where

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,160
it's sort of a ghost in both positions

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,120
and then

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,840
so it kind of i like the time of day

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,080
idea

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,600
but i think that it's not going to look

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,720
right in between the

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,199
you know like in the center point

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,080
between two of the

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,400
i don't know nodes or right or tweeting

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,400
points

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,560
you don't have multiple shadows at the

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,400
same time

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,000
if you were to and i think i was just

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,319
kind of playing with blender i was like

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,160
oh

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,599
i could probably build a telephone pole

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,479
and learn this program a little bit

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,960
better

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,240
right right and i think if uh and the

00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,280
reason about the time of day as i was

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,440
just thinking about that

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,400
if you abstract it even more i remember

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,319
there was something from

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,599
mind share maybe like a year or two ago

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,680
that had to do with

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,360
the concept of like connecting nodes

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,360
sort of like that broadened

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,120
ability it might be possible to do

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,440
something that's like a

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,199
a top down kind of like those shots of

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,160
planet earth where you have cities you

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,280
know light up

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,599
you might be able to have something

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,080
that's a nice fade between like

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,039
where there are points of light maybe i

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,800
don't know

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,160
i don't know exactly what that would

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,240
look like but like conceptually that

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,080
might be a thing that would aid you know

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,080
in that kind of like blend mode because

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,080
i really wasn't sure how that worked

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,919
well one thing i think that that's an

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,560
awesome idea and i think that

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,360
um like we can control the time of day

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,199
obviously

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,720
so like we can make it so that in the

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,720
morning maybe

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,720
we could have it so like it's some kind

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,160
of surface of a planet or something and

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,560
nothing is lit up

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,759
and then like at noon like a few lights

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,479
are connected

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,000
and then um sunset there's even more and

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,560
then at night it's all lit

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,039
up that that might be neat and then over

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,319
time

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,879
like a day progression yeah exactly and

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,199
then

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,919
over but because it's like more things

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,000
coming in

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,199
rather than something moving i think

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,759
that'll work it's just

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,759
one weird whoa hey maria how you doing

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,919
um i think though one weird transition

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,120
is gonna be the fully lit

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,400
night to dawn that might be a little

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,199
freaky but

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,039
whatever i think it's all right i mean

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,039
how many people are awakening anyway

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,560
maybe me but i don't know many other

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,680
people awake and staring at their

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,399
desktop

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,839
yeah at night i'm usually on the phone

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,760
so

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,519
but yeah so that's that's actually kind

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,279
of a cool idea i love that

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,640
it's a really cool concept and it uses

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,800
the time of day too

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,760
so then for this one we'll be thinking

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,720
about

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,720
sort of what i don't know like well

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,920
let's let's pull up some pictures

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,440
here hold on um yeah i'll share my

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,959
screen again

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,640
and i don't have to be the only one

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,680
sharing my screen i think i think it

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,720
lets you people

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:08,320
do it too i don't know do you see a

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:11,920
share screen option

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:15,200
yep yeah okay okay cool

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,200
all right so i'm gonna do

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:23,600
media wiki commons i don't know why it's

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:25,040
not popping up but

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,200
i mean that's the other thing is if it's

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,959
like an earth type thing there's so many

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,959
public domain stuff from nasa

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,519
which is a great benefit nasa's

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:40,000
wonderful just

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,000
let's see

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,640
i think we want one of those ones where

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,040
it like fills the frame

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,720
kind of thing like it even could be

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,880
something like this

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,880
without the the space equipment

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,640
but i don't know what were you thinking

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,040
kyle

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,480
um i you know i just in some ways my

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,920
head was thinking even maybe more

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,959
abstract than that but

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,240
um but just you know like to to have the

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,920
connecting

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,360
um like i think it's the right thing

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,240
like if we're thinking the same thing

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,079
which is like

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,360
those shots of the planet at night maybe

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,800
they're not even from the space station

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,000
maybe they're from like

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,399
satellite or something like that

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,079
probably the space station but just the

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,760
difference between like the

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,040
uh where the points of light are

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,040
essentially those shots at night are

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,200
like where are their cities you know

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,160
um right but then like the progression

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,760
being like

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,519
possibly like a connection of like lines

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,279
or something between them and maybe the

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,000
lines are dark and they like light up

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,519
and they

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,279
almost carry it so it's a little less

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,720
you know i don't know it'd be one of

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,720
those things where i think you know

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,079
we'd have to we'd have to build it or

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,440
like a lot of people could build it and

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,120
then we'd see

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,279
what it might be like play with it and

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,880
see how it turns out

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:58,839
yeah oh here it's something like

00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,440
so this this kind of thing is something

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,160
yeah it'd be nice if they had that

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,079
quality

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,200
because you can see like the lines

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:09,440
between the different cities and things

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,440
but so you can kind of have it spread

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,920
you know i think i think conceptually

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,360
the the

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,040
the thing for me would be like like you

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,320
said like more

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,320
areas are lit up over time right

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,680
it spreads or it grows or it you know

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,839
expands

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,040
and do we want it to be earth or do we

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,440
want to make it

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,920
more abstract like no recognizable

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,839
continents or anything like that

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,800
i think it should be abstract yeah

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,880
yeah i'm wondering if there's any like i

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,640
i you know everybody loves that one

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,240
fedora wallpaper where it's the sound

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,440
wave and it's the trees

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,440
so i'm like wondering if there's

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,040
something we could do like that where

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,200
like it's abstract but there's some

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,240
meaning to the shapes that we work into

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,440
it

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,480
yeah like a like a hidden kind of nugget

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,200
yeah what about some of the graphs

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,959
matthew had

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:04,639
in his state of fedora talk so i didn't

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:06,160
see that um that's okay i could just ask

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,760
him for the slides i think i have access

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,160
to them hold on

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,920
okay that would be cool because yeah um

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,399
i didn't have a babysitter yesterday

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,519
because

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,200
it was her high school graduation her

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,320
high school graduation that still

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,399
happened even though

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,240
hours before the mayor banned outdoor

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:26,399
gatherings of over 50 people

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:29,680
or not the mayor the governor yeah

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:32,399
so we live in interesting times i know

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,399
it's crazy

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,160
um i do have a stupid and silly question

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,880
because i have been away

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,320
from the keyboard for so long nothing

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,399
stupid or silly

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:49,519
no it's all good it's not two questions

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:53,519
i was checking the ticket and

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:56,720
the new ideas come from a letter

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:59,760
so the letter then to just

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,480
select an inventor

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,360
and right right okay yeah and our

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,040
inventor

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:10,880
was h and it's um it's walter hawkins

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:13,200
who invented um he invented a type of

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,959
polymer he's like some kind of chemist

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,600
and he invented some type of polymer

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,360
that enabled them to run telephone lines

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,760
much further than before so he helped

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,000
connect rural communities

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,120
so that would be that would be the the

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,240
one that

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,440
we are supposed to use right yeah

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,399
yeah hawking's the yeah and then we're

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,399
also doing

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:38,560
f34 at the same time so f34

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,560
we could talk about too here let me pop

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,519
that up so

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,920
my screen if you guys can see it yeah oh

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,519
yep

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:51,040
yep here's one of the graphs that

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,040
matthew has in his

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,440
talk i mean i see here we could just do

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,320
like 2019 through

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,800
2020 or something like that probably

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,839
just isolate some of it or

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,839
not there's

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:12,079
fedora magazine page views by here

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,079
ask fedora stats

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,320
let's see what else there is here

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,320
and uh

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:27,360
are these are these um downloads

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:31,199
yeah i think sounds two methods yeah

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,079
yeah okay there's that i think one of

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,320
the things

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,160
because i think yeah i think pulling it

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,320
from data would be really interesting

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,839
and all of you would probably have a

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,680
better idea of kind of like

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:46,079
this one yeah i could totally see

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,090
breaking those up until like a pangaea

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:51,129
split you know what i mean

00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:51,129
[Music]

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,079
uh this one's more interesting ages of

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,880
fedora unique ip addresses seen for

00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:02,800
daily release

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,600
from 2007. i mean you could also treat

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,800
that broad

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,839
shape as like a continent right like a

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,760
zoomed in portion

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,199
of a continent if you wanted to from the

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,320
sky

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,839
yeah right i like that too so like it's

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,360
not i think the one thing that kind of

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,639
i'm wondering about is

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,160
the the thing with the kind of like

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,880
hidden fedora

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,199
seemed to be like really i'm assuming

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,399
and

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,720
like correct me if i'm wrong is that

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,160
people kind of like went oh like really

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,680
and then could kind of like place it and

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,279
it was so simple it didn't need much of

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,320
an explanation it was just like

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,680
a sound wave of of the the the name of

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,920
the distribution

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,600
hello i wonder if there's something else

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,079
that would be like pretty simple like

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,480
that

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,399
and i'm not sure and i'm not saying it's

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,720
not data i'm just wondering like

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,399
that seemed that seemed to be maybe like

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,079
a quick pathway for people to get into

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,880
kind of it

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:57,920
right i think i like china this one's

00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,720
the most interesting

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,720
or this one

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,519
that one looks like it's on fire yeah

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,199
we like you can also probably do

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,279
something with like the raw

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,399
the raw data too you might you might be

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,800
able to like

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,720
i don't know like like plot plot where

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,639
the points of light are based on like

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,320
some sort of like x y coordinate based

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,120
on the actual numbers of the data i

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,079
don't know if that would look

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,320
interesting

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:31,360
should i get with you to share uh with

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,360
us how he made those

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,759
yeah hold on i i have um i have

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,639
something to share with you guys one

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,520
second

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:42,480
okay she's got a look

00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,800
[Laughter]

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,560
[Music]

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:52,480
come on is he gonna let me share uh oh

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,480
hold on firefox is like saying no

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,079
say yes firefox

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,440
okay i think it'll let me do it now yeah

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,679
i like how like it's like remember this

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:09,600
decision and then like it forgets

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:12,480
okay can you see this yep mm-hmm

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,760
yeah so like i was thinking you know

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,919
this is like the

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,919
i love this we could actually do this

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,959
but my thinking was that it's like ages

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,720
of fedora

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,880
i was thinking like each version of

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,000
fedora could have like a little

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,480
continent shape

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,480
and it sized relative to how many

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,640
downloads it had

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,640
so we could sort of work in like what

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,360
was what the largest one is going to be

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,000
like the most

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,280
um the most popular fedora release but i

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,160
think that might be neat

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,120
and maybe um somehow we could take the

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,559
release number

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,160
of each continent and make that apply to

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,960
how many lights it has or

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,600
or or we could do the number of lights

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,360
um

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,960
represent the downloads which actually

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,120
might be a better scale

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,559
so like you know if there was like 3 000

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,000
downloads then we can make it so that

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,440
there's 3 000 points of light

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,160
on that continent and maybe maybe the

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,320
continent

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,200
shapes could have some relation to the

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,360
release number

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,440
like they could roughly you know look

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:15,840
like the number not really though

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,840
i don't know that's one idea

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,000
it's like yeah and it's kind of like

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,520
if you can kind of vaguely tell if

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,240
somebody told you but you couldn't tell

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,240
right away

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,679
that the continent shapes were numbers i

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,320
think that makes it simple and easy to

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,080
grok

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,280
and then also the relationship between

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,039
the number of downloads and the number

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,600
of lights i think is also pretty simple

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,120
to croc

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,760
so i think that could be a good way to

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,760
do it yeah

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,039
real quick i just want to introduce

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,160
samara to the call

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,400
i'm sure you guys all know her name but

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,679
maybe haven't met her in person this is

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,880
uh the design outreachy intern that i've

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:57,360
been working with

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:59,760
mismo this is like your grand mentee

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,760
yeah i saw i saw a part of your inkscape

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,890
talk yesterday that went really well

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,679
very good yeah thank you

00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:07,360
[Laughter]

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,039
anyway i just wanted to interrupt

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,559
because i don't think she's met

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:14,880
many of us in person yet yeah

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,000
cool i like the idea of mismo i'm just

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,039
curious like

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
who's taking like is one person going

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,160
at this and they're just gonna make some

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,720
iterations and we'll like be like oh we

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,640
like this

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,559
are we all kind of going at it what

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,360
what's the plan we're kind of all going

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,280
at it

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,039
and i i think that's i think that's okay

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,960
we're just at that stage

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,960
over time i think you know you have the

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,720
brainstorming just as many things as

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,039
possible and then you narrow it down and

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,039
then

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,400
whatever so i'm not i'm not too worried

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,360
about that although

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,799
should we take things out and put them

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,919
um

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:52,000
yeah yeah definitely um

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,039
yeah and i guess we need to design for

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,760
beta

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,919
by the 18th which is in 10 days oh we

00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,440
got this

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:03,520
yeah so all right

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,039
so hold on so i'm gonna uh i'll write

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,320
some notes here and i can transcribe

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,679
them into the ticket

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,000
so like um so f33 h is hawking's

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,440
okay so what we're thinking about doing

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,960
is sort of like a

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,799
uh world from space view

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,320
and then it's going to be and how many

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,640
releases were on that chart

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,240
i don't remember let's see do we want to

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,480
do the same or do we want to just say

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:33,200
seven consonants because it starts at f6

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:37,520
okay um but before that there's rawhide

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:42,640
okay so and it probably goes up to

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:46,000
32 32 it's separated kind of by

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,120
um like two or three at a time not sure

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,880
exactly why

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,400
but we're gonna i'm gonna have to get

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,360
that info from matthew

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,720
and message him right yeah okay yeah if

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,840
he could pop it

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,799
up not the one that looked like fire but

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,000
the one that kind of

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,000
scaled is that the one we're talking

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,600
about yes i wonder if he could grab

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,360
him there seemed to be like

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,039
i don't remember like seven or eight

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,960
colors that looked like they were on it

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,799
which is about i would say that's like a

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,840
nice sweet spot in terms of like number

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,840
of continents so

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,320
there you go but if there's more than

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,320
one release per continent

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,600
then that makes doing it in the shape of

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,960
the number a little difficult

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,159
so i'm wondering if we can split the

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:34,320
data up differently

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:36,240
oh yeah yeah so it's like 29 to 32.

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,240
yeah you could do a subset or you could

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,840
group them together

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,720
um yeah you could just do the last

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,720
number of releases

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,360
now why is f20 split out on its own

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,360
well anyway so we'll have to figure out

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,760
like shape of continents how do we

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,440
figure that out and it we could just do

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,760
it random too but it might be nice for

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,039
the shape to have a meaning

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,440
this may be something to do with the

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:10,400
numbers

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,200
do it like a like a watching the world

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,120
from the outside

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,559
then you can use use that part of the

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,600
graphic as a

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,120
you know just a partial size side view

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,799
of the continent so you don't have to

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,919
render all of it

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:26,720
something like this so

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,000
what do you mean um i guess i'm not i'm

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,520
having a hard time visually

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,919
liking that can you kind of say it

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,919
another way

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,120
oh look

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,520
all right you guys i'm gonna take a

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,360
quick pause and stop in

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,600
the fedora bingo and then i'll are the

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:49,280
cpu bingo and i'll be back

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,280
okay all right see you in a minute

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,799
okay i really like this picture actually

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,159
i love like the setup of this image

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,159
let me just do it on the share

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,679
that looks great that's i think like

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,799
closer to what was in my mind except

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,640
probably the

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,840
patient was cropped out of the earth

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,840
that looks awesome

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,760
that way you can only use that part of

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,919
the graphic and then you don't have to

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,520
do all of it because if you're going to

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,400
do several months it's going to take

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,320
more time and

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,919
then you have to divide whether you want

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,200
to have the dots representing the

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,000
downloads and all that

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,480
but and if you want to make transitions

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,559
which

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,640
is usually complicated but it takes a

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,919
lot of time but you know this is an idea

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,120
that you can make it

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,760
uh have more lights depending on the

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,240
on the day of that time or something

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,559
like that

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,799
i think that we have that several years

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,799
ago

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,440
okay i really i really like this angle

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,320
and i love how you can like see the

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,400
atmosphere

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,360
and like the the background i think

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,360
that's really nice

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,480
i think that'll be a good way to go and

00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,919
i think what we could do

00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,520
is like do something where yeah it's

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,880
just like a land mass

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,960
and so it doesn't have to be like

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,360
islands or anything like big continent

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,640
islands and what we could do is figure

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,640
out

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,120
where we're just going to map out where

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,000
each kind of release lives

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,880
and if you know we have the concern that

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,720
like

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:21,840
well this block of data applies to 21 22

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:25,279
23 24 we could probably just

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,960
position them next to each other like

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,799
whatever and then so the number of

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,240
downloads the lights would be spread out

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,960
against the one and they'd be like

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,039
together

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,799
and maybe we could do them in order for

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,960
the viewer so like we'd start with the

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,279
lowest release in the lower left

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,640
and then kind of towards the upper right

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,080
move to like the higher numbered

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,480
releases

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,080
um yeah and you can use each one of

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,559
these sections are cities

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,640
kind of reference yeah the divisions can

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:53,520
be wrote and that will simplify

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,480
maybe some just random nice to to trace

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,400
some lines

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,240
in between them that will do that yeah

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,760
yeah yeah

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:05,679
but for all paper usage i

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,960
will use some i mean the lights

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,520
should not be that bright because

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,799
sometimes i mean i i don't use anything

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,440
on my desktop

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,799
you know no folders no icons no anything

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,880
but i know that there is still some

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,760
people that use it so it should be

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,080
not that bright probably do you think

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,400
that

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,200
this one is the nice a nice mix of

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,520
brightness

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,320
or do you think it's too high contrast

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,440
for me it's

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,840
still too high but i mean

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,279
that is just a couple of dots down it

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,520
shouldn't be that hard to

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,720
to have it less contrast but this is

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,240
still a nice

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,880
really nice colorful lid and i'm sure

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,919
that you

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,400
we can easily just use the fedora colors

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,919
for it

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:51,039
i mean it's just gorgeous yeah

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:53,760
okay cool i'm loving this idea um

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:56,080
and it has like a deep concept behind it

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,120
too which i think is really cool connect

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,480
everyone in the world right right

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,159
and you kind of get that too just

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,919
looking at it like you get the

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,279
thought about connection and everybody

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,039
being together

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,840
yeah which is also sort of a nice theme

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,720
given the rona times we're in right

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,720
exactly

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,720
and when it's downloads uh the data's

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,080
from fedora releases then it kind of

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:22,840
proves that fedora did this over time

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:25,440
right right okay do we want to shift to

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:29,120
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:32,400
sure okay so 34

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,080
is i and it's ub i works

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,440
and i'm probably butchering his name but

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,840
that's okay because people butcher my

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,360
name

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:42,960
so karma um and

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,799
let's see oh this is from the actual

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,360
patent artwork yeah i saw this before

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,360
that's neat

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:53,679
yeah i was having a lot of fun with uh

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,720
trying to like recreate the uh

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,320
the functionality of the device um and

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,120
obviously i just did it with the patent

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,440
but i think you could do other things

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,880
right like i think like part part of

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,600
what i thought was

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,960
would be would be interesting is if

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,400
because i know there's a lot of

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,080
like actual

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,559
cartoony type things that have been

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,840
developed for fedora over time now

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,320
one one of the ones that i thought of

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,000
was like um a

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,600
beefy miracle but i know there are other

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,279
ones like pandas and things

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,720
you know like you might be able you

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,919
might be able to have like because i

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,679
think like typically like in the

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,039
foreground there's a

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,559
there's actually like a cartoon

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,320
character moving and then those are all

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,200
the background elements that are sort of

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,000
like

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,559
oh yeah like uh i forget the name of

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,080
that

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,320
but yeah i mean it's basically like

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,960
multi-plane yeah yeah that's what it is

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,799
yeah

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,159
and so like i i wondered what and again

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,679
that's kind of why i was asking about

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,200
the shifting frames again

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,200
is like you could have a character

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,279
progress from one side of the screen but

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,960
obviously you'd have that blending so

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,120
but that would kind of give the illusion

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,200
a little bit of like and a granted over

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,480
24 hour period of like kind of how that

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,000
product works but i think like the

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,559
layering thing is really interesting

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,120
but those are just my thoughts okay paul

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,039
sorry

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:12,240
i got the fpl here in the chat

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:16,240
to talk to us about this graph

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:20,159
he's saying that um breaking up of the

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,159
different releases was arbitrary

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,960
what about f20 what if f20 do to anybody

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:31,360
i don't even like what was the thing

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,360
with that i don't remember it

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,360
you know i'm a middle child man we get

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,480
the worst

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,480
it's not fair i'm gonna ask him

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,559
why was f20 a big release was that

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,520
something to do with like the cloud

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,880
images because i know

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,880
that was like f8 right

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,000
is raw data available too did you tell

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,840
him our idea

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,520
or no no he's gonna come on to video

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,880
oh i think he's gonna flip when he hears

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:13,840
it because it's an awesome idea

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:13,840
i think he will prove

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:19,520
i think he said he had to jump onto a

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,520
laptop or a different computer

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,240
okay

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:31,279
yeah the source that numbers by release

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,279
that would be perfect

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:45,279
yeah we started talking about f34 too

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,919
sort of our our cartoon properties of

00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:51,279
what we have

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:51,279
pandas hot dogs badgers

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,120
because you know he's a disney guy right

00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,960
this is an animation

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,960
yeah that's multi-plane so

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,120
i think i'm gonna have to read up on

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,559
what multi-plane means

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:14,480
hi hi hi

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:18,080
um okay

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,559
so yeah the um great i broke them down

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,480
by the pattern what was going on there

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,360
the f8 was a huge release

00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,840
because uh for some reason it like on

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,520
the

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:32,480
individual graph of um just that release

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,840
it was very it was like twice as big as

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,919
the surrounding releases

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:40,320
in terms of um the number of users

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,240
for like continuing on and on for many

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,080
years and we're not quite sure why but

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,919
it might be because of amazon

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,120
using it as a base image for a bunch of

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,960
things um

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,320
and then never updating from that ever

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,679
to our frustration

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:57,279
um then we had some growth up until the

00:30:53,679 --> 00:31:00,399
uh fedora 15 fiasco um where

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:02,720
things like basically almost nobody

00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:04,480
went to fedora 15 and then it took a

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,240
while like things were on the decline

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,279
and fedora 20

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,080
is both where things leveled out and

00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:13,120
also where we took a year between fedora

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,399
20 and 21

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,880
instead of um instead of six months so

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,640
that's what i

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,320
meant by being a big release like it was

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,480
that whole year and

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,320
basically the pattern for each release

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,320
is the numbers keep going up

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,399
until we put the next one out which

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,000
caused that one to be also kind of a big

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,559
spike so i wanted to highlight it by

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,240
itself

00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,919
and then the green is where we started

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,919
with fedora next and that's where we

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:40,240
started having workstation server

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:42,159
cloud separate um and then the orange

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,360
was it's really kind of a continuation

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,919
of that but i also

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,360
um it's when we started with modularity

00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,000
and i wanted to see if there's any

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,720
difference

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,559
there really it really seems to be this

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,200
kind of continuation of the green

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,720
blob green and orange are also matthew

00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,240
miller was the fpl

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:03,919
um but that's a coincidence

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,200
really nothing to do with the gigantic

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,399
growth

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:11,200
do you want to hear our idea uh

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,399
yes i want to hear your idea okay here

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,840
let me give you a quick

00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:19,360
rundown here hold on i can share

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:22,559
yeah okay so for f 33

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:24,720
um our our um inspiration is the

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:27,360
scientist walter lincoln hawkings

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,320
he designed a specific type of plastic

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,519
polymer

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,840
for telephone cable sheathing so um his

00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,919
big

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,360
sort of claim to fame was he he

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,960
connected all these rural

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,640
areas to the telephone network that had

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,159
never been connected before so

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,679
there's like an obvious thing where you

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,279
could like think about this is like the

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,279
theme of connections and

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,799
outreach and inclusion and all these

00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,960
kind of good things i think

00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,480
um that are also we were saying earlier

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,240
kind of very rona

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:56,559
relevant um so the idea that we had

00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,279
if you've ever seen this thing before

00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,679
yes

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,120
yes yeah so we were thinking something

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,480
like because you had like the ages of

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,440
fedora so we were thinking

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,919
like the continents of fedora right and

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,240
then

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,159
um because it's about connections like

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,279
one of the ways that you can see how

00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:15,519
earth is connected at night is um

00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,880
do i have it you know one of one of

00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,799
these sorts of things but

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,279
um where's the one tatika scent because

00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:24,000
that one was really awesome

00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,880
why can't i find oh here it is okay so

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,799
we were thinking

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,640
this sort of composition and you're

00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,519
looking at a planet but it's not earth

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,880
so it's not going to be like

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,440
recognizable continents

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,120
instead it's going to be the continent

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,200
of fedora releases

00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,120
and it'll go maybe left to right

00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,000
starting with like the earliest release

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,519
over to the later releases and for each

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,039
really individual release

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,640
we'll have the number of lights

00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,600
represent the number of downloads that

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,679
it had

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,440
and we'll show sort of like connections

00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:55,679
between them does that

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,679
sound good um

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:03,039
yes um i don't have numbers before

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,200
six so we'll have to make those up um

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,159
or we can just leave six out too i mean

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,079
there's nothing to say

00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,480
hard to cover every single one it should

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:13,760
start at six um the other thing is like

00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,440
i i'm glad we're going up now but i feel

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,200
bad about that part in the middle where

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,119
it was going down

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,159
um so i don't necessarily wanna i to

00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,280
make sure we're not accidentally

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,679
emphasizing that

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,599
in the um oh that's cool that's just

00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,919
that's where the rain forest is or you

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,960
know the lake

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:32,399
burning i think the on fire part i think

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,000
i think the other thing too is we were

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:37,200
talking about kind of having the

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,399
four um different images being part of

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,960
the transition

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,720
and so we'd have four different takes

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,720
where more lights showed up

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,480
so it would be like all right that's the

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,399
coolest part of the idea

00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,879
yeah so like in the morning there's no

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:53,200
lights and then like at noon

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,919
it starts lighting up a little bit and

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,240
then

00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:58,079
at sunset it starts lighting up a little

00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,720
bit more and then at nighttime like

00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,960
midnight it's fully lit

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,760
you know with the time of day yeah yeah

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,320
yeah

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,680
i mean i i will also point out um

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,040
traditionally we've done

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,520
four um because and of course somebody's

00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,960
gonna be

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,560
pissed off that i'm suggesting this but

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,119
that's okay um

00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,880
we don't anymore do the different aspect

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,079
ratios of the wallpapers so it used to

00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,079
be we'd do a wallpaper

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,079
the four images and then multiply that

00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,520
by four so it's 16 because of the

00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,880
different aspect ratios

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,560
well we're not doing aspect ratios

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,240
anymore we're just doing one big thing

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,119
and then it'll get cropped auto

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,800
or fitted however so i mean there's no

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,839
reason that we can stop at just four

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,440
points during the day

00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,520
we could add additional points if we

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,440
really wanted to i don't think if we

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,480
make the files nice and small

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,480
right i mean that's it's

00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,640
yeah yeah but no i i think

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,400
four is fine i'm just saying that like

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,520
it's not any kind of technical

00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,359
limitation that we're limited to for

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,680
we could do one that just shows just for

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:06,960
like one minute at midnight that's

00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,680
like it's just like a big like beefy

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,160
miracle

00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,000
smiley face and you just see it for like

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,119
a second

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,520
you know 12 37

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,880
like wait what was that that's that's

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,800
your warning that like you're

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,359
you're awake and it's too late go to bed

00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,440
please you're hallucinating

00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,960
okay all right cool but do you like the

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,920
other overall concept

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,720
yeah i think that's good um do you have

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,320
data

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:37,200
for individual releases um yes

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,960
so this is i mean this is generated i

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,000
have a script that generates this from a

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,119
csv file that

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,760
actually has numbers per day um

00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,920
and smooch is a little bit worried about

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,960
sharing that numbers per day file even

00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,400
though i'm pretty

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,320
i i don't think there's anything that

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,280
can trace back to anybody on that

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,640
but historically we've been careful

00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,760
about sharing that

00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,480
um but i mean actually if you get the s

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,480
the like spg of this i'm pretty sure

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,000
those lines directly correspond to the

00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,480
numbers the numbers might actually even

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,920
be

00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,560
embedded in the file um

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,640
but i i think this we just kind of want

00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,560
um the sizes per release so i could get

00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,079
you like the maximum number for each

00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,480
release

00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,520
um okay that would work yeah and the

00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,200
other thing that's

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,440
i mean i think this is fine for a

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,079
visualization like these numbers

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,520
don't necessarily map directly to users

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,240
or systems they're just kind of an

00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,800
impression

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,079
because um you know there's a lot of

00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,400
factors that

00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,280
the new system is much better for uh

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,000
being reliable

00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,760
actually counting individual systems um

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,400
well that's okay because i mean a light

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,839
is lit

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,680
it could be a house with a family of

00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,400
five it could be a house with one person

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,640
in it so

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,000
in the same way like lights on the earth

00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:55,040
or not any sort of

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,040
yeah that makes sense okay cool

00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,880
i'm psyched about this idea

00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,079
all right well now we have to come up

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,760
with something for uh f34

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,680
when can you get those those numbers by

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,880
the way because um our due date is the

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,320
15th

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:15,520
um i

00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,720
theoretically whenever um i used to have

00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,000
a spreadsheet with them

00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,920
in it then i switched to using the

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,520
script-based thing so it

00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,520
actually is ironically harder

00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,320
but i mean it is just in a csv file i

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,440
can

00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,119
i can do it pretty quickly um okay

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,560
will either do it when i get a break

00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:38,480
between things

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:41,599
now or um bug me about it next week

00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,280
um i don't know

00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,520
try and get it there i mean you can kind

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,440
of get a rough idea from

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,720
well this one and then there's the other

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,200
like per release

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,240
graph as well which can i upload images

00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,640
here wouldn't that be

00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:59,119
awesome um you got a screen share

00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,560
but if you screen share it and then like

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,240
i can make it full screen

00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,000
and then take a screenshot of it and

00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,520
then upload it somewhere and post it to

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,280
the chat

00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,839
or you could just screenshot it and post

00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,839
it to the chat

00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,160
that's how i do things like i do online

00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,680
classes and i like take screenshots and

00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,599
i upload them because the

00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,440
online i think we were using zoom and

00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,960
like half the people couldn't see what

00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:29,839
the teacher was uploading so

00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:29,839
oh my gosh

00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:43,839
i'm reprocessing here

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,599
even those fancy new lenovo laptops so

00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,000
this is faster

00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,599
a lot of them are sold out you know

00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,280
which is great because my daughter's

00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,839
chromebook that she needs for school

00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,839
just died

00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,560
so yeah stuff selling out everywhere

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,319
i guess as the school plans come out and

00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,560
parents are like oh yeah i guess my kids

00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,880
are

00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,839
going to school i guess i will have to

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,839
buy a laptop

00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,079
well so as to not put you on the spot

00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:29,280
let me open up uh

00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:32,880
the f34 thing again

00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:35,200
so here i'm gonna drop in the chat

00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,200
um

00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,319
thank you firefox your new thing where

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,880
you only select the last word of a url

00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:46,000
that's

00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:50,319
always what i want um

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:52,480
this is the per release thing here um

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,359
almost eyeball just eyeball the numbers

00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,119
from here

00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:58,800
um but i can also get to the actual

00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,800
peaks of that when i get a chance

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:06,000
oh that's kind of it makes me think of

00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,640
one of those fancy um

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,599
uh water fountains at like a casino or

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,720
something oh yeah

00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:14,400
right it almost looks like there's a

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,599
pattern there

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,560
yeah yeah you can see how eight and 20

00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,720
kind of stand out

00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:24,319
here in this one here so i was trying to

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:27,680
put that in the stacked one as well

00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:32,319
the 20 kind of looks wide yeah

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:34,800
well exactly it's the gap year exactly

00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:37,359
gap year release i do like that trend

00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,000
upward though man that's nice

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:42,079
and you can see um this has some of the

00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,839
data dinosaurs not taken out there with

00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:48,000
that weird pink spike near the end

00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:50,000
obviously that's not real

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,119
and the reason the bars are so thick

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,079
like that like the

00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,440
um is because on weekends it drops down

00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:59,200
so if you zoom in on this

00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,599
it is actually basically exactly on the

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,319
week

00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:04,480
weekends and weekdays so the new system

00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,160
doesn't have that because it actually

00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,599
aggregates the entire week into my

00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,800
number um

00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,400
so okay it usually i just show the

00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,440
moving average graph of this

00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:18,640
because it also smooth that out but this

00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,640
this shows the peaks better

00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,319
i feel like we could probably even just

00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,240
go off this graph

00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,520
i mean we can just eyeball it enough

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,560
right

00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:31,839
no one's going to count every light yeah

00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:33,119
exactly you know and to get variation

00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,400
you might have to like

00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,520
do something different anyway i mean

00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,359
what's the difference between a hundred

00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:40,640
thousand lights and 120 000 lights

00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:42,960
maybe it's visible i'm not sure

00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,640
as long as they're right like the scale

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,119
relative to each other

00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,800
has some sense i i don't think it

00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,720
matters beyond that

00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,319
and we may find if we plug it in and we

00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,680
put like 10 000 lights or a hundred

00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,280
thousand lights or whatever

00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,040
like oh that's way too much so then

00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,720
we'll just use some kind of factor to

00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,440
tone it down

00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,520
yeah but it'll be nice to be able to say

00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,560
it's based on the real numbers though

00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,319
right right exactly so

00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,680
and then in the future if you want to

00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:12,240
light it up even more

00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,560
download get all your friends this is

00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:19,040
just a pure

00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:19,040
5 255 255 image

00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,240
everything is washed out

00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,599
okay all right well thank you

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,200
very much matthew that was very helpful

00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,720
yeah sure this is a great idea i

00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:34,800
i'm looking forward to the results yeah

00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,480
all right i'm gonna jump off to see the

00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:40,240
end of another session

00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,400
all right see ya all right so can we do

00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,319
this again for f34 just as quickly that

00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,800
would be nice

00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,160
um yeah so oh i'm not sharing anymore

00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,760
hold on

00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:55,200
again oh we have chat

00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,720
comments too oh i had a supply chain of

00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,359
the laptops

00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,400
yeah you know i had a webcam on order i

00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,079
ordered it

00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,359
i ordered it the first week of march

00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,319
because i figured things were going to

00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,920
get bad

00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:07,520
and it kept getting delayed it kept

00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,800
getting delayed and then

00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,800
they said it like wasn't going to show

00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,640
up till november so

00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,640
yeah you can't even buy a webcam anymore

00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:22,000
okay why is this not letting me okay

00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,720
all right so f34 okay

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,160
yes so the multi-plane camera it's

00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,000
actually um

00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,760
i think is there there's a picture of

00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,560
him

00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,240
here and i think madeline put it

00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:37,280
together something too but i don't have

00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:40,640
it handy

00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:43,040
basically marie all it is like it sounds

00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:45,440
way more complicated than it is

00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,280
he just had different platforms like

00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,119
this this this all the way up almost

00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,920
like a ladder but flat

00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,119
and then the camera pointed down through

00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,880
all the layers

00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,240
so you know how they do like cell

00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,280
animation on like those

00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:02,319
transparencies so to be a different cell

00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,960
on each platter i got you and then

00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:06,319
so like they could move i think they uh

00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,520
i think this was like the pioneering

00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:10,560
thing for like uh

00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:12,400
snow white like the original and uh you

00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:15,520
know like the background

00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,040
based on how deep the background was

00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,400
supposed to be it would move at a

00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,400
different rate so like if

00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,520
the bushes in the background were closer

00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,040
to snow white

00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,720
and then the trees and the forest in the

00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,560
background were way far away

00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,400
the way far away stuff wouldn't move

00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,200
quite as much but the bushes would move

00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,480
faster

00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:35,280
so it let you sort of make that um

00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,359
what is the name there's a name for it

00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,160
it's like parallax

00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,640
parallax that's it so you could parallax

00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,800
stuff

00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,839
with the hand-drawn animation so that's

00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,680
really all it is it was just like a

00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,560
super tall camera with multiple planes

00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,240
on it

00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,240
and yeah and then i think at some point

00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,119
they also occasionally compressed them

00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,040
so they could do like

00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,400
zoom shots where background elements

00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,359
wouldn't get as large or something like

00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,880
that yeah so

00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,560
you could probably like screw it or

00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,960
something so that they came closer yeah

00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:14,319
they like

00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:18,000
shifted not available oh

00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:18,000
he's in your past sorry man

00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:22,720
no this is not animate that one day

00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,720
night because that's the idea for the

00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,920
current one and that would be like kind

00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,200
of repeating but

00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,359
probably just some i i have no idea if a

00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,720
landscape or a picture or whatever but

00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:35,200
it's slightly moving i mean

00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,920
i even have that as a parallax on my

00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,400
website

00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,839
and i just place a solid background and

00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,079
then an svg on top

00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,520
and when you scroll just a tiny bit it

00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,400
seems that it moves and it's actually

00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:48,319
just a

00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:51,440
really two percent zooming effect

00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,839
so that would be interesting i don't

00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,440
know

00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:55,359
how complicated yeah the only thing is

00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,960
we don't have access to like change the

00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:58,240
code to do that sort of stuff

00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,480
so we're kind of limited with the

00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:04,000
framework that's already there

00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,599
i mean i mean maybe we could bribe

00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,200
somebody or whatever but we don't

00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:10,160
we don't even really have the time to do

00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:14,960
it unfortunately

00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:18,800
cake fresh cake from yesterday maybe

00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,800
i'm a cake yes but not time

00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:31,440
i'm negative on time right now please

00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:34,480
[Music]

00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,359
so i guess i know we're like kind of

00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,599
focusing on

00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:39,440
like the technology behind it but i'm

00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:42,880
kind of focusing on the

00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:45,520
visual effect that um it was

00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,640
able to create so like thinking about

00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:50,319
having like

00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:53,119
the soft kind of um almost watercolor

00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:53,920
type of a background and then having

00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,640
these

00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,200
types of objects on top that are a

00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:01,119
little bit

00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:04,480
flatter um and kind of having

00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:07,599
uh some kind of in-between layers right

00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,359
so something in between really soft and

00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,640
kind of artistic and something a bit

00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:13,200
more graphic

00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,880
so that's kind of when i when i'm

00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:18,160
looking at this and the

00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:20,480
the i just googled multi-plane camera

00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:22,319
and you know it's talking about it's

00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,079
giving a couple examples

00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:26,400
talking about snow white it's talking

00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,960
about and that when i think about

00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,400
those old animations i just i'm

00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,640
marveling at like

00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,640
the beauty of the background and the

00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,960
artwork that goes into them

00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,319
and then how they do the animation over

00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,480
that and somehow

00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:41,440
the two styles actually really work

00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:45,200
together

00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:49,760
so um that's that was kind of my

00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:51,280
first thought when i saw

00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,520
yeah well i'm wondering if we could do

00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,520
something see the problem is like

00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:58,079
you know nice watercolor background and

00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,839
then like beefy miracle

00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,520
there's a little bit of contrast there

00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,640
well right um i think there's an

00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,559
artistic way

00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,480
to do this and i could be the one to

00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:10,000
pursue this

00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:11,839
um yes this idea that would be awesome

00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,200
i mean we're all kind of taking a stab

00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:15,359
at different things but if

00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,359
this is the idea that came to me i'm

00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:19,200
ready for it

00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:22,079
okay so do you like the idea of bringing

00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:25,440
in sort of the the fedora characters

00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,400
like that yeah and the badger and the

00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,240
panda

00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,680
and maybe i don't know i mean are there

00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:34,559
other ones we have so

00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,559
now i'm starting to think about like how

00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,599
not the most favoritest company in the

00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:43,359
world but anyway disney

00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:45,760
um they kind of take their um

00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:47,200
they're older characters and they

00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,920
they've started doing them in different

00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,200
styles

00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:54,480
like offering books or art prints

00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:57,359
or whatever it might be so it could be

00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,079
the kind of thing where we do and i have

00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,240
the background

00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,920
and the skills to do this kind of sketch

00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,520
it could be looking like a sort of an

00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,400
animated

00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,160
sketch like an animation sketch of the

00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,800
badger of the panda

00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,520
et cetera et cetera and it could be like

00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,400
have that

00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,760
slightly more artistic look to it but

00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,839
i'm afraid for it to

00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:22,559
go too far like towards a disney vibe

00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:23,119
so i haven't i have an idea though okay

00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,880
so

00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:29,040
with the transitions it could start off

00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,920
the background is this i have no idea if

00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,400
this will work but

00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,119
the background is the pencil sketch yep

00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,440
right

00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:37,200
and then the characters are sort of like

00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,800
you have like the circle and like the

00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,680
perspective lines and they're like a

00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,839
sketch

00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,680
and then later on in the morning you

00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:46,400
know maybe they're inked

00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,920
and then you know the sunset one you

00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,240
have like a little bit of color coming

00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,520
in

00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,920
and then at midnight it's like full

00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,760
blast

00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,240
i like it i feel like with the way the

00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,440
transitions work it would like slowly

00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:01,040
come in and it might

00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,400
actually work and not look crazy

00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,960
the same with the lights because you're

00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,920
adding you're not taking away or moving

00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:10,079
you could also try it fill in the colors

00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:13,200
of the background so you could have like

00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:14,559
the bushes on layer two and the tree on

00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,680
layer three and then all of a sudden

00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,760
they're like

00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,599
you know there's a base paint and then

00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,119
there's like some defining lines kind of

00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,079
like the ink you could have like even

00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,680
color come in

00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,160
that might be a little bit wild for a

00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,240
background like you know i like

00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,760
i like the idea of building through the

00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:33,040
day yeah but it could

00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,960
it could fill yeah

00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,319
maybe starting the color because i think

00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,400
that the black and white is going to be

00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:41,200
very stark and high contrast

00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,400
so yeah it might be good to have i

00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,000
wasn't i might be good to have the

00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,240
pencil sketch

00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,920
oh okay so like have the pencil sketch

00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,079
on like very pale colors

00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,440
yeah run with it but like yeah that was

00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,240
something i was thinking we could use

00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,559
that time of day

00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:59,200
i kind of like the um i i like the

00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:00,480
aesthetic of the thing that kyle put in

00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,880
here already

00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,640
that kind of like the white on the blue

00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,760
kind of yeah

00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:09,119
and that was kind of my thought yeah

00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,240
that was kind of my

00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,880
for for the at least for the sketch how

00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:16,240
that would

00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:19,440
kind of work with the coloring

00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:22,400
um i think it needs some

00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,280
exploration like i gotta take out some

00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,720
pencils

00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:30,240
and uh some markers and stuff and like

00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,880
try things all right but like as a

00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,319
concept

00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,880
can we hold on let me um i just wanted

00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:38,559
to share

00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:40,880
this oh no wrong one ah there we go

00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,000
yep yeah this is like the style i was

00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:45,440
thinking that like

00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,200
where you have all the yeah so um

00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,839
i'm wondering is there a way we can also

00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,839
tell you guys

00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,079
is there a way we could tie it to the

00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:57,920
data somehow

00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:57,920
data for something anything

00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,559
i don't know um

00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,880
well

00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,319
i mean you could have the background

00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,599
elements be like a graph

00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:13,920
i mean that's kind of how we got away

00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,720
with the fedora 26 thing being like the

00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,520
sound

00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,160
wave right it was you know you could you

00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,280
could have

00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,200
i mean i don't know what it would look

00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,680
like but you could you could mirror and

00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,119
this is

00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,880
more simplistic version than maybe you

00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:27,440
do but the graph

00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,200
that was in matthew's presentation just

00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,000
kind of like the increasing fedora could

00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:33,599
be

00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
a bush here and you know a tree top here

00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:35,920
and

00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,359
something else somewhere else that's an

00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,760
overly simplistic version but you could

00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:43,760
probably hide a graph in the environment

00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:45,440
garrett in the saying

00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,000
the data could become the landscape

00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,440
which is i think a similar idea yeah

00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,319
scribble at the beginning and then

00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:54,839
adding in grass trees

00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:56,160
beefy's not good with numbers so he

00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:59,280
can't

00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,280
keep it to the background

00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,319
yeah and then um oh you know i depending

00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,839
like how crazy we want to get with the

00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:09,599
characters i was just thinking we have

00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:10,960
like an extended family of characters

00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,440
too because

00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,319
we have the dan walsh three little

00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,640
piggies

00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:17,520
from the container coloring book and we

00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,480
have

00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,960
the container commando characters we

00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,720
have

00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,720
the cat and the dog from the sc linux

00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,400
coloring book and we have another

00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,720
coloring book coming up that my intern

00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,839
madeline's working on it's a snow white

00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:33,599
based one for kubernetes so we have like

00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:35,040
a whole extended family and they all

00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,359
it's kind of interesting because this is

00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:39,119
sort of inspired by a disney guy

00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,720
that some of them i mean there was a

00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,240
three little pig's disney cartoon and

00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,359
certainly snow white was a thing for

00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,119
disney and

00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:47,359
um we kind of take some of the fairy

00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:49,760
tales for technical concepts

00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:51,119
i have one i have one thought to put in

00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,400
here is that

00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:58,559
if it gets too cartoony

00:54:54,400 --> 00:55:00,880
we're gonna get some criticism

00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,079
oh yeah we will get criticism that's all

00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:05,040
right

00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:08,000
we'll get it no matter what so i mean

00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:11,440
listen i feel like i loved

00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,880
i love the newest wallpaper like i think

00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:16,480
it's great

00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:18,799
clearly other people yeah yeah

00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,520
so they just like don't get it like they

00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:21,119
don't get

00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,559
like the preference i think that there's

00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,319
like a whole lot of people go from where

00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:26,079
i work with badges there's a whole group

00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:27,359
of people who are like well that's just

00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:29,520
for fun and you know they want to

00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:32,799
consider themselves all like serious

00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:35,359
and i'm a hacker i don't know like

00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:36,480
there's people yeah but it's totally for

00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:38,400
the hacker culture

00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,599
like you know it's it's almost it's like

00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,680
inspired by like

00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:43,359
ready player one or like you know like

00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:46,240
the old school

00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:47,680
you know bit artwork and it's like wow

00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,000
that just went straight over your head

00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,040
didn't

00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,119
it all right but it's you know like

00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,319
it's all right i think it might be nice

00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:56,079
for me to also get

00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:58,960
pull some inspiration from something

00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:02,079
like miyazaki or some anime

00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:05,839
um that might actually play with our

00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:08,799
crowd a little bit more yeah definitely

00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:10,640
yeah if you did all of our characters in

00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,280
like the anime chibi style people would

00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,799
lose it

00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,119
like they would just love that and even

00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:16,079
though it's like you know characters and

00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,359
cartoons

00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:19,760
there's always going to be like the

00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:21,040
grumps okay whatever but everybody else

00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,960
will love it

00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,880
we already have comments like anime

00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:28,960
ghibli anime rocks

00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:31,760
yeah so i think an anime look maybe

00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:34,559
or uh yeah like i'm real like studio

00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:37,119
ghibli has that watercolor

00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:38,480
and the that you know uses that same

00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:41,520
style

00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,640
so yeah yeah and i think honestly i

00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,000
think that's good too because it's

00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,839
distances from disney like

00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,240
yes the animator was a disney person but

00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:50,000
also disney's like the antithesis of

00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:52,960
what fedora is all about in terms of

00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,720
sharing and whatnot so it's good to

00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,000
have a little bit of you know yes cool

00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,880
invention bro but

00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,640
you know we have other ideas about how

00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:04,160
we license things yeah

00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,160
right um cool

00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,440
i was just gonna say in some ways disney

00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:13,839
is no longer carrying the mantle of like

00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,839
hand-drawn animation

00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,880
it's very true did anyone see mary in

00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:20,880
the witches flower

00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,640
okay well if you have netflix and you're

00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,280
in the us

00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:28,400
i'm not sure mayor if you'll have it but

00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:32,480
uh

00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:35,520
it's an animated film

00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:37,599
made by one of the anime animators who

00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:40,960
was in miyazaki studio

00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:43,440
so he has left and started a new studio

00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,880
so it has like very much the same look

00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,359
and feel

00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,480
and it's such a cute little adventure i

00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:50,880
think

00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,319
you could probably show your eldest

00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,970
daughter mismo

00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:56,400
i mean maybe pre-watch it but um

00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:58,720
[Music]

00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:01,200
yeah it's very very cute anyway just had

00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:04,079
to throw that in there

00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,799
um just to put another hold on i'm going

00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:08,160
to open it up

00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:09,040
another disney alternative too and like

00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,359
i'm a crazy

00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:13,200
like irish person and that's fine so

00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:13,760
just i'll show it to you and just humor

00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,000
me

00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,920
um there's this studio because ireland

00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,400
has like a strong tradition of animation

00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,839
because

00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:23,760
um of tax laws uh don bluth opened his

00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:25,599
animation studio there he used to be

00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:28,000
disney and he's the guy who did like the

00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:30,079
five-hole american tail stuff

00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,760
um and i guess they continued the tax

00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,280
breaks and whatever so

00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,119
because they they started up all these

00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,400
schools for animators to study how to be

00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,920
an animator so that they could work at

00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,119
don blue studio and then his studio

00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,000
folded and they opened up all these

00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,160
studios so

00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
one of the studios is cartoon saloon and

00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,839
they have like a really neat

00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,319
it's sort of unique like it's it's

00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:51,280
clearly inspired by miyazaki

00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:52,319
but they also kind of take celtic um

00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,319
like book of kells

00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:55,839
type stuff and they they bring those

00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:57,440
elements into it

00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:59,839
which makes it like really unique if

00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:02,480
you've ever seen anything

00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:04,000
or whatever yes the secret of cows and i

00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,480
love the visuals in that it was like so

00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,760
crazy

00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:09,680
like oh my gosh yeah right and then this

00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:12,720
one is the um

00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:13,359
song of the sea um it's about like a

00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,040
selkie

00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:17,040
it's like a mermaid but a seal instead

00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,319
of a mermaid yeah

00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,640
and they have a new one that's coming

00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:23,040
out that apparently um

00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,640
it's the wolf walkers it's about i think

00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,839
it's actually about salem massachusetts

00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:28,000
it's these um

00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:29,440
people that are like pilgrims that are

00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,160
like hunting in the woods or something i

00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,079
don't really know

00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,920
but there's like wolves that possess

00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:36,480
these these natives or whatever

00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:38,160
it's kind of neat um that one is

00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,599
actually coming out and apple picked up

00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,680
the rights to it

00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:44,000
um but yeah i mean it's just it's just

00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:46,480
another style they do puff and rock too

00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,680
if you've seen that that's on netflix

00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,760
but i just i don't know i

00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,280
i like their style it's like definitely

00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:55,040
it's not

00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:56,079
it's not just plain anime it's like

00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,079
i don't know it has a little bit of

00:59:56,079 --> 01:00:01,839
something else to it

00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,839
so just pointing that out

01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:06,720
oh my gosh i was just grabbing a trailer

01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:09,359
for this one that i was talking about

01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,839
marion witch's fart and like the opening

01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:13,040
shot

01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:15,839
is like that's the style we should do

01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,839
that's so cute

01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,760
let me see if i can do it

01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:29,359
she's got that icy little face but

01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:33,760
that quick sketch it's just

01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:33,760
perfect oh wow

01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,559
but anyway this is the trailer for the

01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:41,280
one i was just talking about

01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:43,599
super cute movie definitely watch it and

01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:46,319
it is on netflix

01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:46,319
it's very cool

01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:53,119
all right and then i think oh one idea

01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:57,280
that i had for the

01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:59,520
data aspect um so f33

01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,359
is going to be about the actual sort of

01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,720
like downloads or ip addresses or

01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:06,079
whatever so that's like

01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:08,799
um how fedora itself is being consumed

01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:11,119
it might be neat for 34 especially

01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:14,079
because it's like a character focused

01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:15,839
design that it could be focused on data

01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:18,799
around the users maybe

01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:21,040
like maybe how many contributors we get

01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:22,839
over time or

01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,079
i i don't even know like how many

01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:26,559
contributors

01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:27,839
for some release that was recent or

01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:28,319
something like that rather than over

01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:30,079
time

01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:32,319
so i don't know i i think we should play

01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:35,040
around a little bit like

01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:35,599
i'm thinking about like frames per

01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:39,200
second

01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:41,119
right like how can we equate like the

01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:44,480
idea of like frames per second

01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:48,559
to something in fedora

01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:50,240
i don't know what about like the um

01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:51,680
i'm thinking about like some of the

01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,000
videos that we made the first one that

01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,400
comes

01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,640
to mind is the one we made at flock in

01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:59,760
budapest

01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:01,200
which is like a really awesome video but

01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,520
i don't know if there's any way to

01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:05,119
take take it and interpret it yeah i can

01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:08,400
get it on youtube homer

01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:10,079
okay i've probably seen it but i can't

01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,400
visualize it

01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:15,920
i honestly cried when i saw it the first

01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,920
time you guys i'm such a mush

01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:21,839

01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:59,680
can you hear sound on it

01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,680
i can turn it on

01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:06,160
can you guys hear it no

01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:08,319

when people have the

01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:11,440
in there oh yeah i've seen this i've

project

01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,799

i had an idea for the war

01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:03,440
um inspiration so i don't know if you

01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:06,960
guys have heard of the game chris

01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:08,559
um it's a really

01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:11,520
uh i only played it because it was

01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:17,280
really beautiful and it has a

01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:17,280
um watercolor aesthetic and

01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:21,359
so this is the kind of like it has a lot

01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:23,280
of layers

01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:25,920
so i think that could also work since

01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,760
the multi-plane animation thing also

01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:31,599
focused on different

01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:31,599
layers that they had

01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,359
i love this style it's beautiful yeah it

01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:40,640
looks even

01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:41,680
it looks technical too yeah because of

01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:44,640
the shapes

01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:45,680
it's very like geometrically can you

01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:48,079
post a link

01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:49,280
and or what is it chris the art of the

01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:51,760
game

01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:52,839
so it's called grace grace and the game

01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,760
is really

01:04:52,839 --> 01:04:58,799
um really i would say aesthetic

01:04:55,760 --> 01:05:01,520
overall so if anyone gets a chance to

01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:01,520
play they should

01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,160
awesome i love us

01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:12,559
okay we have crisp players

01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,559
um

01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:22,079
oh i have a switch i should

01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:24,000
get that i have a switch too well my kid

01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:26,000
does haha

01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,359
oh my gosh it was like intuition i

01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,640
ordered a switch

01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:33,920
a week before coped isolation

01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:37,039
oh it wasn't me now they're all gone

01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:39,839
for sure yeah yo i ordered it

01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:40,799
for my daughter's birthday like well

01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:44,000
before

01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:45,200
and they canceled the order and so i had

01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,760
to buy it basically

01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:49,039
i bought a scalped one and the thing

01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,960
that really kicked me

01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:52,319
is i i had bought it from gamestop like

01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,760
ordered it from there

01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:55,760
and the one that i bought that was

01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:58,000
scalped was from gamestop the guy didn't

01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:59,839
even open up the gamestop box

01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,039
he just like put another label on top

01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:03,599
i'm like great so

01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:04,960
all right that's the same exactly at

01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:06,799
least she got a birthday present it's

01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,400
like a week before a kid's birthday you

01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:09,920
find out it's not coming and it's like

01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:14,000
oh my god

01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:16,240
right totally how old is that that's i'm

01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,760
guessing it's for your oldest one right

01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,680
yeah she's seven that was her seventh

01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:22,240
birthday oh my gosh

01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,200
yeah i know i know i don't know what she

01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,720
was born

01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,400
and i just i just got her the

01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:28,079
subscription because she plays

01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,760
her best friend got one for his birthday

01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:31,359
too and they do mario kart because he's

01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:35,039
like a crazy mario a holic

01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:36,400
and they were playing video chatting

01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:37,599
and like they would load up the same

01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,200
level and play because we couldn't

01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:40,640
figure out how the multiplayer worked it

01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,160
doesn't actually tell you you need to

01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:44,640
buy a subscription to make it work

01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:45,920
it just hides the button which great i

01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,119
know i thought nintendo was better than

01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:48,559
that but that's okay

01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:52,240
so she has the subscription that one

01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:53,680
they actually play it together for real

01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:56,880
maybe it's because i don't want kids

01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:58,000
just randomly subscribing to stuff

01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,440
well i mean they could at least say

01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,960
something like you know tell your

01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,640
parents i mean they do have very good

01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,599
parental control type stuff like they

01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:05,920
have like this long

01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:07,920
id number that you need to to pass to

01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:09,520
the other person and it's like very

01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,599
it would be very hard for a kid to like

01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:14,400
meet some random weirdo which is great

01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:15,599
but just let me know i have to pay

01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,280
because we didn't know like we just

01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:20,880
assumed the game wouldn't do it

01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:21,440
right anyway anyway cool so lots of

01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,079
different

01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:28,000
styles here i'm loving this chris style

01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:29,599
this is just beautiful

01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,760
yeah i'm wondering how we can bring in

01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:35,680
sort of the i am fedora

01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:37,280
stuff to it like maybe what we could do

01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:39,119
i'm just thinking like it sounds like

01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,920
we're gonna do something that's maybe in

01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:42,160
the woods

01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:43,200
or like you know nature a nature driven

01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:45,839
background

01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:47,680
so it might be neat to have that

01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:49,599
background represent sort of where

01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:52,160
fedora contributors are from

01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:53,440
you know like native plants or trees or

01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:56,319
flowers or something

01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:58,559
like representing sort of the population

01:07:56,319 --> 01:08:02,480
of our contributors

01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:03,920
i like it i don't know how obvious it

01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,280
would be though

01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:07,359
but maybe it doesn't have to be too

01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:11,760
obvious

01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:14,640
yeah i think

01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:16,159
f26 like fedora word thing come out was

01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:18,560
it in like a magazine article or

01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:20,000
something at some point

01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,920
i don't remember but that's definitely

01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,600
something where you wouldn't know it

01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,759
but then somebody pointed out to you and

01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,120
you'd be like snap i get it kind of like

01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:29,199
the fedex logo

01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:30,640
arrow right whereas something like this

01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:32,000
where it's the different trees it's a

01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,640
little bit more like you have to think

01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,040
about oh

01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:36,640
like i don't know i'm a nerd about trees

01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:38,000
and like what kind of tree that is but i

01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:39,279
think most people are just like it's a

01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,040
tree i don't know

01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:43,279
where's that tree from i don't know i'm

01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:46,560
like i'm a nerd about trees but like

01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:48,719
spiritually so i like don't

01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:50,319
care what kind of tree it is i'm just

01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:52,080
like man that's a beautiful tree and i'm

01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:53,920
drawn to it that's all i got all right

01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:56,239
sorry for the interruption

01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:57,359
no it's all good i love you know bean

01:08:56,239 --> 01:08:58,880
trees

01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:00,560
with like the big long they're a native

01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,560
to america they're

01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,839
they're amazing there's somebody down

01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,040
the street because

01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:06,719
it's not like a tree you could like go

01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,520
to the nursery and buy like they're just

01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:10,319
like this

01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,960
really ancient native american tree and

01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:12,960
it's just

01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:14,560
it's spectacular it's the only way i can

01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,600
describe it it's just like this massive

01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:18,400
canopy

01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,920
and um it has like these big long bean

01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:21,679
pod things which is why they call it a

01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,880
bean tree i mean it has a real name i

01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:24,080
don't know what the real name is but

01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:27,920
it's a bean tree

01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:30,480
they're very cool uh that grist game

01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:32,640
artwork reminded me of steven universe

01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:36,319
artwork

01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:41,839
which is also super cool and has

01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:41,839
a really interesting style to it

01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:47,120
um it kind of has like this artsy

01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:51,679
i mean it mixes different styles

01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:54,239
altogether

01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:57,280
is one of the things i like about it but

01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:57,280
this one's interesting

01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:00,640
we're just talking about

01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:07,360
plant life et cetera

01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:09,120
well i like how that has like the

01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:12,480
sculpture and the mountain

01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:16,080
face yeah that is gorgeous

01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:16,080
we could do something with that

01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:31,840
i was thinking of um

01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:45,840
let me see if i can find what i was

01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:45,840
looking for

01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,840
so

01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,199
here it is in the daytime

01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:18,320
oh that's neat i love this little oh

01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,320
it's animated

01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:25,360
this reminds me of the wallpaper the

01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:28,800
watercolor

01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:28,800
with the trees and the reflection

01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,239
yes it does

01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:38,159
it's gorgeous

01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:55,840
i carried away

01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:09,840
oh here we go

01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:24,320
so um this is the uh it's the part of

01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:27,679
the storyline the song of the sea and

01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:29,600
they built the guy is in the cliff face

01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:31,120
so it's actually based on like an old

01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:34,800
very old ancient

01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:37,520
whatever um story about the

01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:39,280
face of the island like look like a man

01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,719
that was sad and weeping so like there's

01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:42,640
a story about how

01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:43,920
the man cried so much that it created

01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,440
the sea and because

01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:47,120
he had such a sorrow because something

01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:48,960
terrible happens and whatever that's

01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:50,400
part of the storyline is there

01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:52,159
i think kind of part of the storyline of

01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:54,080
the whole movie is like they rescue this

01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:54,960
guy's soul and he's freed from the rock

01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:57,280
which is neat

01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,719
but yeah i think like if we could have

01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:01,360
some sort of mountain

01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:04,080
sort of cliff face thing that could be

01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:05,120
like one way to represent stuff sort of

01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:07,920
conceptually

01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:07,920
it might be neat

01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:13,920
now i'm thinking about moana yeah yeah

01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:18,880
the moana mountain

01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:20,239
back to disney

01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:22,320
but it's also like it's something where

01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:23,440
you could have you could have some sort

01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,960
of narrative there i don't know if we're

01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,520
like trying to inject too much into it

01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,520
but

01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,719
i just i like it to have some concepts

01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:31,440
like like

01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:33,280
relating to the invention is good having

01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:34,000
beefy miracle in there is absolutely

01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,760
awesome

01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,760
but having some sort of like deeper

01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:39,280
significance is definitely like

01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:41,440
something i'd like to see so i'm trying

01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:42,960
to think about are there narratives

01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:44,840
there or how can we connect it to our

01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:47,760
contributors

01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:49,199
um i don't know i think there's a

01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:51,840
certain amount of

01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:54,239
like nostalgia that people see when they

01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:55,920
when they see those characters

01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:57,440
i feel like if the characters are in

01:13:55,920 --> 01:14:00,719
there

01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:01,360
i'm not sure you need like much more

01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:03,440
than that

01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:06,480
except for it to be well designed and we

01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:10,080
have tons of inspiration that we've

01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:13,520
um pulled up during this right

01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:16,080
so i know i'm wondering i'm wondering if

01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:17,760
there's like an example of something

01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:19,520
where it shows because like the ones

01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:22,000
that we've looked at is all like

01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:23,920
there's different scenes that like you

01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,880
know each have their own thing but i'm

01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,400
wondering

01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,000
could we do something where it's a

01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:30,960
transition like across

01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,320
different modes so that you know like

01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:34,560
like it's like a scene

01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:36,239
like i've seen i've seen illustrations

01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,880
where like the background will be sliced

01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:39,440
into four

01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:41,280
quarters and the like one slice is

01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:44,719
winter one slice is fall

01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:46,880
one is spring summer something like that

01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:49,040
where it's sliced into something

01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:50,000
but then each thing it's sliced into

01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:52,400
represents

01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,159
a part of the community and you know it

01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,040
could be like the geographic region

01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:56,400
they're from

01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:58,880
or it could be like the type of

01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:59,840
contributions they make so maybe like

01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:02,800
they're sort of like

01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:04,719
the coder slice and maybe that's very

01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:06,800
geometric like the crisp

01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:08,880
artwork and then maybe there's another

01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:10,239
slice that's sort of like designers and

01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,640
like a slice for

01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:14,159
um like docs or marketing and then a

01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:16,400
slice for

01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:17,760
qa or that kind of thing do you know

01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,040
what i mean so it's like the different

01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,440
slices could

01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:23,120
represent the pieces of the community

01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,000
and it those sort of like neat

01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,679
transition

01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,040
backgrounds are kind of neat too but

01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:27,440
maybe it's just throwing too much in the

01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:30,560
pot

01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:32,080
just sort of one way to i think just jot

01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:34,480
it down

01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:36,560
and when i'm sketching it'll give me

01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:39,600
plenty of different

01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:43,120
areas or ways to go down

01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:46,880
yeah it could be the four f's as well

01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,880
oh yeah that could do

01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:53,840
if we use four characters

01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,400
how you use the characters will be

01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:00,480
interesting too because i think like

01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:02,560
depending on the art style right like

01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:04,000
like beefy could be like a very very

01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:06,719
very small

01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,800
you know figure that could be discerned

01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:10,560
if you wanted to but it could just be

01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,679
something in a landscape and then it's

01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,480
just another one of those things that

01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:14,159
you point out

01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:15,520
you know like beefy is inherently

01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:17,679
ridiculous but

01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,800
but like less ridiculous based on the

01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:20,560
inter you know how

01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,159
how the scene is framed and things like

01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:24,480
that what the art style is i have a

01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:27,520
challenge for us let's make an artistic

01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,520
beefy miracle

01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,199
i have one idea actually and it might

01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:34,560
make it

01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:38,080
it might make it more um

01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:39,520
i don't know more wallpapery um

01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:41,520
if you guys know like those hidden

01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:43,760
pictures things like of course i have

01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:46,480
kids so like highlights magazine

01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,800
so it kind of blends into the background

01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:49,040
but

01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:50,880
it's sort of like the backwards like

01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:52,239
it's the exact opposite of what oop

01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,159
eyeworks invention does

01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:55,440
but i mean if they're like a different

01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:57,199
like if you have the watercolor

01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:58,480
background and then you have the actual

01:16:57,199 --> 01:17:00,400
drawn characters

01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:01,920
that are just sort of like sliced into

01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:03,440
it that might be neat too and they

01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:05,199
wouldn't stand out as much

01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:06,880
so you'd have less contrast which is

01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:08,640
good for a desktop background

01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:10,800
but then like they'd still kind of be

01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:12,640
worked into it like beefy miracle is

01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:14,320
like in the bark of a tree or something

01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:17,920
like he's the face

01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:21,679
right right i like that idea too

01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:22,239
so i think um i think we have enough

01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:25,600
ideas

01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:28,800
so i'm just gonna say it um

01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:31,840
and we have even more from

01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:34,400
the um chat someone's saying a

01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,400
silhouette

01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:41,679
geometry plus plus how about having

01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:44,560
multiple characters embedded

01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:45,280
within an element instead of a single

01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:48,020
character

01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:50,960
i'm not sure what you mean sayak um

01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:53,440
[Music]

01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:56,000
they would people want to see the old

01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:58,210
sad king happier

01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,960
if we went in that direction

01:17:58,210 --> 01:18:05,199
[Laughter]

01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:07,360
uh i need a pencil sharpener i'll be

01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:07,360
back

01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:16,320
and we're getting a response that um

01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:19,440
someone likes to find out when there's

01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:23,120
a meaning behind some piece of art

01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:24,800
so that's cool some positive feedback

01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:26,480
i think i have plenty to sketch on and

01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:30,000
this is for 34

01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:33,040
right one this is 34. once they're both

01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,480
i mean it's good to have something by

01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,520
the 15th for both

01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:37,280
because they're trying to do them both

01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,080
at the same time but like it's

01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:41,040
definitely

01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:42,640
more pressing for f-33 because that's

01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,840
the actual deadline for us so are they

01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:47,920
doing them early

01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:49,679
or we're trying to get ahead of release

01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:51,280
and then we'll be ahead so like this is

01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:52,320
sort of like the catch-up one we're

01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:54,320
doing two at once

01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,679
and then moving forward will always be a

01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:59,040
release ahead

01:18:55,679 --> 01:19:02,560
so i don't know i plan to take it

01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:06,880
particularly easy next week

01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:08,719
this week is really intense so um

01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:10,159
i actually think that sketching is

01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:13,280
something that

01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:15,920
helps me take it easy and it's sort of

01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:19,360
related to work so

01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:23,199
i'm working yeah

01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:26,480
so i think i can uh do some of this next

01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:28,159
during the week and get it uploaded

01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:31,360
and my thought is i'm just going to go

01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:33,920
in do some sketching

01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:37,120
if people want or feel inspired to like

01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:40,080
maybe make landscape backgrounds

01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:40,719
uh make that kind of like do watercolor

01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:43,520
at home

01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:45,440
like whatever um piece because i have a

01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:47,360
feeling we're gonna end up mishmashing

01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:49,199
a whole bunch of stuff together so

01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:51,199
there's definitely no

01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:52,640
rule that i'm have to be making all the

01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:54,560
pieces

01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:56,239
what's up and how i'm how are we

01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,120
changing it over time again i forgot

01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:58,719
that part

01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:00,320
are we changing it over time are we

01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:02,320
shifting things

01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:04,159
i'd say we're already trying to do that

01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:07,360
for the other one

01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:09,600
let's just attempt to get something

01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:11,520
going and i think it'll evolve

01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,880
from there because i think there's too

01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:15,840
many ideas

01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:17,280
to settle on like how that evolution

01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:19,840
would happen

01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,840
okay

01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,120
okay well let's see so what i am going

01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:30,159
to do

01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:33,120
right now is i'm gonna

01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:34,960
um document in the tickets for both of

01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:38,080
these the discussions we had

01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:39,199
and what time do we have all right so we

01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,880
have an hour left so

01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:42,639
i mean we have an hour to do sketches

01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:44,800
maybe we could get some sketches posted

01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:44,800
too

01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:49,199
is there a way to like i kind of want to

01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:53,040
take a screenshot of our

01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:55,920
lovely faces hold on

01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:58,159
my screenshot shortcut was not working

01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,159
all right

01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:04,719
ready

01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:05,120
tactica i know did you have crazy i

01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:08,239
gotta

01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:11,440
look at the screenshot you're making

01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:15,440
crazy eyes that was hilarious

01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:17,040
yes yes they were a part of that

01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:18,480
do you want do you care to try again or

01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:21,440
is that your your go-to

01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:21,440
no yep that's it

01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:29,679
nice um awesome thanks moe for taking

01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:32,719
the notes and putting them on the

01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:34,159
thing there i think i'm gonna try to hit

01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:37,440
some of the other sessions

01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:42,000
and then take a rest

01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:45,040
before the social hour sessions start up

01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:47,760
but this was really awesome cool

01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:49,280
i feel very productive i'll see you guys

01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:51,760
soon

01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:51,760
hopefully

01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:56,560
so do we want to just take the rest of

01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,600
the time in sketch or do you guys want

01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:01,600
to just

01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:01,600
head off that's either way i'm cool

01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:11,120
yeah what yeah whatever which um

01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:14,400
you were thinking you were thinking of

01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:14,400
sketching for 34

01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:19,760
uh yeah or even 33 i mean we need both

01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:24,560
33 is the one i guess with more of the

01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:26,159
deadline on it

01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:27,600
well let me i'll i'll take the time

01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:31,440
anyway um

01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:34,639
to document the notes that i wrote down

01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:39,840
if this is not the system okay i'm gonna

01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:39,840
write them right now

01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:07,840
so

01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:18,239
that's just me reposting the tickets so

01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,679
if anyone wants to

01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:21,600
throw a sketch into there that might be

01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:24,080
an easier place for them to kind of

01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:25,120
all be in one place yeah that would be

01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,800
awesome

01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:28,480
i like keeping the tickets as sort of

01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,239
like the main thing because it's just

01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:32,320
like one stop shop for everything on the

01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:34,000
wallpaper

01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,440
and i guess this is being recorded so i

01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,239
guess we could always post the recording

01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:38,080
afterwards

01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:40,080
with all my uh smiling about in the

01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:42,239
beginning that'll be awesome

01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:44,800
maybe i can edit that out you just yeah

01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:46,400
you just cut it

01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:48,000
well it's not like we had access to

01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:50,960
speakers to like

01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,280
see how this worked ahead of time so i

01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,360
mean

01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:55,040
i i wonder if every talk is like that

01:23:53,360 --> 01:24:03,840
like oh

01:23:55,040 --> 01:24:03,840
what am i what am i doing here

01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:23,760
i'm gonna go take a break um it was

01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:26,000
really nice meeting you

01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:27,520
oh yeah really nice to meet you as well

01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,480
i had a question for you is your was

01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,920
your session from yesterday recorded

01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:34,239
um yeah i think all sessions are

01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:35,920
recorded okay so i'll be able to okay i

01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:36,560
missed it yesterday but i wanted to see

01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:38,000
it so

01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:40,960
i'll try to find a way to watch it on

01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:45,840
the platform thank you so much

01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:45,840
bye-bye bye bye

01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:57,440
and if anybody in the chat is really

01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:58,000
excellent at blender please feel free to

01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,950
design the

01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:03,360
earth and populate it with lights

01:24:59,950 --> 01:25:05,760
[Laughter]

01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:07,360
we need to get uh micah he's really

01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:09,280
awesome at that stuff

01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:10,639
yeah he makes like really cool materials

01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:13,920
he could probably do like that

01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:17,280
ozone glow thing really yeah

01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:18,800
yeah yeah and silvia i don't think

01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:21,120
i don't know that like it's tied to

01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:22,960
blender i think honestly i was just

01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:24,960
playing around with it so if you look in

01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:26,960
the ticket on 33

01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:28,960
i was just like oh cool this guy did 10

01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:30,719
full telephone poles i'm going to

01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,080
build a telephone pole to kind of like

01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:35,600
learn blender better

01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:37,520
so i don't know it's it's tied to

01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:39,760
blender specifically that's just what i

01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:41,520
was doing kind of to learn

01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:43,120
oh yeah no but it would look really nice

01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:45,040
if it was blender and we sort of have

01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:47,120
been picking up blender i mean every now

01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:48,880
and then we'll not do blender but

01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:50,560
you know it's it's an amazing tool for

01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:54,400
this stuff yeah i mean

01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:56,400
it's nice because oh go for it no just

01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:57,440
just just like i'm well we might be

01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,920
thinking different things i'm thinking

01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,520
just

01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,960
populating like a hundred thousand

01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,880
lights is not something i want to do

01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:05,120
with pointillism right i like i wanna

01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:07,360
you know click the button and say put

01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:09,520
lights over this continent or whatever

01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:11,040
right right and then if it's in blender

01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:12,080
and you have the scene constructed there

01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,440
and like we decided

01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:15,199
that angle doesn't work you can just

01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:16,080
kind of move the angle whereas if it's

01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:17,760
something that we

01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:19,520
sort of did an inkscape or something

01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,400
like that it's like oh i have to redraw

01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:23,040
all this

01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:23,520
right yeah particularly if we do the

01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:26,800
like

01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:27,760
the um the the four views like picking

01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:30,000
like which lights

01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:31,600
should be lit up at any given time and

01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,280
how bright should they be are we

01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,960
you know it'll just make it a little bit

01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:37,840
easier to make those decisions after the

01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:37,840
fact

01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:46,159
the learning curve is not only steep for

01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:46,159
you sylvia it's also steep for me

01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:49,679
it's not as bad as it used to be though

01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:51,040
no that

01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:52,800
actually when i started getting into it

01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:54,719
was the 2.8 tutorials because the

01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,719
the user interface was a lot easier more

01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:59,679
sensible at least in my brain

01:26:56,719 --> 01:27:01,120
yeah the old one was not good i started

01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:01,760
learning on the old one so when the new

01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:05,120
one came out

01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:07,520
it was just much easier yeah i tried and

01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,520
gave up

01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:16,000
okay i'm going to post the image tatika

01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:19,120
shared

01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:23,760
if i can find it again

01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:23,760
where did it go here it is

01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:33,840
okay

01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:56,960
oh he actually gave a full link to that

01:27:55,840 --> 01:28:01,440
data didn't he

01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:03,199
i could find that now

01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:05,280
it was i probably could post it back in

01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:07,120
the chat here

01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:15,840
oh that'd be handy if you got it yeah

01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:15,840
there's the imgur link right there

01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:29,840
like image url but yeah who knows what

01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:33,280
it's supposed to be

01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:33,679
gif or jif you know yeah well no it's

01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:38,800
it's

01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:41,760
clearly gif i agree on this point

01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:43,040
well if it's gnome it's gif it's just

01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:43,840
it's just how it has to be and i know

01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:47,679
it's going home

01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:50,560
so okay so we have

01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:52,159
the data we have the sample wallpaper i

01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:56,159
have the narrative

01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:57,760
is there anything else

01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:59,520
don't think so i guess the other note

01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:04,480
was just uh

01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:05,840
with the lights we need to make sure

01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:11,840
the contrast is appropriate for a

01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:11,840
desktop wallpaper

01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:15,360
okay

01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:22,719
so the shiny new comment notes is in 33

01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:22,719
now i'm going to hit 34.

01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:25,840
okay so

01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:29,040
concept

01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:40,080
i don't know what to call these cartoon

01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:42,000
guys they're like

01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:43,360
i don't know that they're historical but

01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,120
they are historical

01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:46,480
that we'll just feature fedora

01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:51,040
characters

01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:52,719
well-loved beloved yeah

01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:55,120
we will feature beloved fedora

01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:56,159
characters so it says beefy miracle and

01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:57,679
i know we're going to get complaints

01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:58,880
about that because beefy miracle is

01:29:57,679 --> 01:30:03,440
offensive somehow

01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:03,440
um panda badger

01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:08,719
were there other ones um oh yeah and if

01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:11,600
we need if we need more

01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:13,840
the extended family from the coloring

01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:17,440
books

01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:20,800
three little pigs container windows

01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:23,920
dog cat and snow white and the

01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,920
kubernetes dwarves

01:30:24,159 --> 01:30:32,719
okay these characters will

01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:32,719
be done in an anime style

01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:41,280
how about this will be done in a style

01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:46,840
influenced by miyazaki

01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:52,719
of the chris video game illustrations

01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:52,719
um mary and the witch's flower

01:30:52,880 --> 01:31:03,840
cartoon saloon the steven

01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:03,840
universe um

01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:14,239
the background will be

01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:19,840
multi-layered as a connection

01:31:14,239 --> 01:31:19,840
to boots uh multi-playing camera

01:31:20,239 --> 01:31:28,960
uh watercolor style heavy on the nature

01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:32,000
maybe rocks with characters or

01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:36,880
symbols embedded in them

01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:40,320
trees maybe with faces

01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:44,960
plants etc

01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:48,000
and then the characters

01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:49,440
can be very obviously on top of the

01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:53,199
background

01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:57,280
or if we want them lower contrast

01:31:53,199 --> 01:32:00,960
we can embed them in the scene

01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:03,440
bella highlights hidden pictures

01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,440
puzzles

01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:15,520
one idea for the background is to

01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:19,040
split it into quarters

01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:22,800
or some other fraction and have

01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:26,239
each quarter influenced

01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:29,920
by a discipline or region of

01:32:26,239 --> 01:32:32,960
fedora contributors for example

01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:37,760
a developer's quarter

01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:37,760
that is more geometrical

01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:44,400
to say a designer's quarter

01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:48,080
was there anything else

01:32:52,159 --> 01:32:55,360
i don't think so i think that was that

01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,440
yeah

01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:59,199
frank in the chat is i think i think i'd

01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:00,800
say that as well but like uh influenced

01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:04,800
by the four f's could be the

01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:07,199
the quad oh yep yep would be an idea

01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:08,320
um which is a good one i think yeah i

01:33:07,199 --> 01:33:10,000
think that's everything there were there

01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:10,480
were like a lot of different ideas for

01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,840
that one

01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:13,760
so it'll be interesting to see how that

01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:15,280
one turns out

01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:17,280
so i'm gonna write at the bottom we're

01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:21,199
heavy on the ideas

01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:24,880
for this one so some of this will

01:33:21,199 --> 01:33:28,719
be shaken out as sketches visuals

01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:32,080
are put together uh marie

01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:32,560
said she's happy to take point on this

01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:37,840
one

01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:37,840
so i'll assign it to her

01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:41,520
and she also sounded like she was open

01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:44,639
to send me backgrounds and things you

01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:44,639
know if people were gonna do that

01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:52,800
she can focus on the character design

01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:52,800
and

01:33:54,080 --> 01:34:00,639
we'd like a variety of contributors

01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:01,679
to work on background concepts and

01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:05,840
submit them

01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:05,840
here how about that

01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:13,600
sounds great okay cool and

01:34:12,159 --> 01:34:16,639
yeah i think that's good so i'll post

01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:18,239
that so there now we have notes

01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:20,880
so we actually did something there's a

01:34:18,239 --> 01:34:20,880
record of it

01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:26,480
um yeah that's pretty cool

01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:36,239
all right very exciting all right so

01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:38,400
i'm probably gonna head out because um

01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:40,320
yeah i mean i i feel like we got a ton

01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:42,080
done this was a great idea

01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:43,840
yeah don't no worries if you showed up

01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:46,320
late thanks for coming

01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:48,080
and honestly like i this platform is

01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:49,600
cool and there's like other platforms we

01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:51,199
could use too i mean we could do this

01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,639
sort of meeting on a regular basis

01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:54,400
nest or flock doesn't have to be

01:34:52,639 --> 01:34:56,639
happening for us to meet up like this

01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:58,080
i feel like you know in the span of

01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:58,880
honestly it was more like an hour and a

01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:00,719
half

01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:02,480
we worked through ideas that normally

01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:04,239
asynchronously probably would have taken

01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:06,080
us three or four weeks to do

01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:07,840
so i mean it kind of takes a load of

01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:09,119
stress off too to kind of have that

01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:12,000
stuff

01:35:09,119 --> 01:35:12,719
worked out so quickly yeah yeah yeah

01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,880
there's

01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:16,159
like i can say like uh that's always

01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:17,679
sometimes the challenging thing on the

01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:20,480
asynchronous forums is like

01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:21,679
what does anyone think of this right

01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:22,960
well it's like you put it out there and

01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:24,719
it's like you don't hear back and you're

01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:26,639
like oh god was a terrible idea or

01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:29,360
wouldn't it you know it's just

01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:31,440
async kind of sucks sometimes sometimes

01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:32,800
it's a great record though

01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:36,159
yeah yeah well that's the thing it's

01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:36,159
good it's self-documenting

01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:43,840
all right well i'm gonna head out thanks

01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:43,840
