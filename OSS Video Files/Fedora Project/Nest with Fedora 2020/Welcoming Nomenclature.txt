um

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,240
and now we have another one from rich

00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,760
bowen

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,400
who is um a community organizer or

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,040
community manager in ospo the same group

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,160
that marie

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,560
works in uh but he works on centos

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,279
um you may also know him from apache

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,400
because he

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:25,439
is huge in the apache community

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,720
and yes there's no laughing it's true

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,720
um and uh has been it worked on

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,399
rdo and a bunch of other stuff at red

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,559
hat before

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,520
and is now doing awesome things for

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,360
helping build community at centos

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,559
so actually rich gave a version of this

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,640
talk internally

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,600
and i said this seems important for

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,399
fedora

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,840
as well so i invited him here for this

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,800
so i'm looking forward

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,559
thank you rich thank you matthew thanks

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,760
for inviting me marie

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,239
um i'm gonna talk about something that

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,640
has generated a bit of controversy

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,600
in open source as a whole over the last

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,680
few months

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,119
you may have noticed this conversation

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,159
happening in the language kernel

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,720
community

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,439
and uh i'm actually part of heading an

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,000
effort

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,360
toward this at red hat and that is

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,720
removing words

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:20,799
from documentation and our software that

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:24,560
marginalize or otherwise oppress

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,640
minorities within our organizations in a

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,000
attempt to make our communities more

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,799
welcoming

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,600
now i have to start with this disclaimer

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,000
right i'm a

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,079
i'm a white middle-aged bearded man

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
living in suburbia in a state that

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,280
continues to re-elect mitch mcconnell

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,640
every year so

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:46,240
what can i possibly tell you

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,880
well um i i want to skip to the punch

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,040
line

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,960
right up front and i hope that this is

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,159
what you take with you

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,560
if you go as you go away as you forget

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,159
the rest of it

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,560
the reason that i feel that i have

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,880
something to say is is twofold one is

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,320
that

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,159
i have a certain power and influence in

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,119
a community to make changes

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,520
that uh other people may not have and

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,480
it's my responsibility to use

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,800
that privilege in a way that helps

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,239
people who do not have that privilege

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,920
and and the way that i am able

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:26,959
to have these opinions is that i listen

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,800
i listen to minority voices i read

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:33,599
minority twitter i follow people

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,480
that uh perhaps would not have the loud

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,400
voice that i

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:42,000
i can give in my position um

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,800
if this sounds self-congratulatory if

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,400
this sounds

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,160
uh pretentious that's because this is

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,239
aspirational this is something that i

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,120
strive for every day that i strive

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,680
towards

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,680
this this high goal that that i'm

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,599
claiming is something that i do

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,360
um but what i want to encourage you to

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,640
do is to listen

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,840
to minority voices on twitter

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,680
watch emmanuel acho's video series

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,879
uncomfortable conversations with a black

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,800
man

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,120
listen more than you speak if you have

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,000
questions read some more

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,080
be uncomfortable and and deal with that

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,599
uncomfortableness and remember

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,239
that your moment of discomfort is

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,239
just a shadow of the daily discomfort

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,239
and actual suffering of so many other

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,400
people

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,000
i alone cannot change the world but i

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,480
can use my influence

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,560
to change a small part of it so

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,760
what are we talking about well several

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,319
months ago

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,000
on twitter i saw the tweet that you see

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,080
on your screen now

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,120
and it said i refuse to use whitelist

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,840
and blacklist or

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,640
master and slave terminology in my

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,680
software

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,120
words matter and i

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,879
um this is something that i had been

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,319
thinking about for a number of years

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:06,000
i hadn't done much about it

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,519
so i decided that in a

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
software project that i have a lot of

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,040
influence on i would make this change so

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,280
i'm

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,560
i'm one of the members of the apache web

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,600
server software

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:21,600
project i have been for 20 years

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,280
and i i made this change i went into the

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,560
into the project i made the change i

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,240
committed it and that was something that

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,360
i could do because i had this

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,280
this privilege and that i have

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,120
uh social capital that i could spend on

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,840
that

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,880
so then the question is why why would we

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,520
do this

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,560
um and there are there are two primary

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,199
reasons

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,880
why this change is important and i'm

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,560
gonna i'm gonna focus on the word

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,320
blacklist because

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,919
it uh it's one that uh

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,840
people of color in the united states

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:59,199
have been talking about for generations

00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,400
um using black in a negative connotation

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,080
like blacklist

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,479
like blackmail it calls attention to the

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,000
fact that a part of a person's identity

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,680
their blackness

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,479
is a metaphor is a uh

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,720
is means bad means evil means reject

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,479
and this is a death by a thousand paper

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,199
cuts every day you're faced with this

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,160
notion

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,960
that an aspect of your identity means

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,639
bad

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,320
and then you know me personally i'm

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,280
faced with the fact that white means

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,440
good

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,600
and uh these things build up over time

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,680
now the secondary reason is that if we

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,759
use words in english

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,680
that are not an analogy that are not a

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,320
metaphor for something else

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,639
they are in fact clearer to communicate

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,360
the concepts they're easier to translate

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,120
and they are words that end up

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,280
communicating better

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,360
the concepts rather than through analogy

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,680
and so here's here's my change to the

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,120
apache web server it was a minor thing

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,039
and i recognize

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,800
that in many software projects this is

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,960
not a minor thing it involves changing

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,000
apis it involves

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,919
changing configuration variables in my

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,280
particular project this was an easy

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,880
change and i don't want to make i don't

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,240
want to trivialize this and say it's

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,840
just five minutes of work

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,360
it was five minutes of work for me but

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:24,560
this is a special case

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,639
a couple days later a uh an old friend

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,319
of mine sebastian bergman

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,319
announced that he was doing the same

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,840
thing in php unit which is a very

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:37,120
critical part of the php

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,120
ecosystem and uh

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,720
in each of these cases these actions

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,919
these comments generated a lot of

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,520
backlash

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,199
and that's really where i want to focus

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,039
is is talking about

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,560
the reasons that people object to these

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,280
things there

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,319
are many many reasons to object to these

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,880
things

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,520
and i want to emphasize that all of the

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,199
objections

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,680
most of the objections are objectively

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,680
true

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,199
they are things that are valid arguments

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,120
and you have to weigh those valid

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,800
arguments against the benefits of making

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,039
these changes

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,039
um

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,919
even if you so it's important one of the

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,120
one of the mantras at red hat is assume

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,639
good intent

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,479
when you go into a situation where

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,000
somebody is irritating you you have to

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,520
step back and think why are they doing

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,039
this what is their valid reason for

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,360
doing this they're not just doing it to

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,240
be a jerk

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,479
so most of these responses that i get i

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,639
believe came from well-meaning people

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,759
that were objecting to a disruptive

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,919
change

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,120
that they did not see a direct benefit

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,720
to

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,560
and some of these arguments are indeed

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,160
petty but most of them are not most of

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,800
them are important

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,240
folks will argue that they have not

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,440
experienced

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,280
the negative impact of these words

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,199
and and you know they often point to me

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,039
and said i haven't i haven't experienced

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,039
that either and that's very true

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,319
i have never been oppressed a day in my

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,720
life and so

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,000
i have to believe as i said earlier

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,520
other voices

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,639
that tell me that this is a problem

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,240
um and they'll argue that they're well

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,039
let me jump into it here's some of the

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,720
things

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,720
that people will argue that the first

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,639
thing is that that's not what those

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,400
words mean and this is objectively true

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,240
it is true that the that the etymology

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,240
etymological origins of the word

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,159
blacklist have nothing to do with skin

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,000
color this is true this is objectively

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,479
true and you can trace it back

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,440
through history and see when this word

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,719
occurred

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:46,320
and that is really

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:50,000
not the point the point is that

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,480
a word means in someone's mind

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,080
how they perceive it words change over

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,000
time

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,200
language evolves it's a feature of

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,680
language one of my

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,040
uh you know i'm fascinated by etymology

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,560
i would encourage you to look up the

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,959
etymology of the word

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,360
awful which means beautiful and

00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:09,440
inspiring and

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,200
filling me with wonder that's what the

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,040
word awful means

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,399
obviously it doesn't mean that anymore

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,519
but if you hang your hat

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,360
on the etymological argument that's what

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,080
happens you end up getting stuck

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,800
in definitions of words that have no

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:29,360
relevance today

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,839
uh the next thing that uh

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,720
yeah oh and i encourage you to watch you

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,800
can find this

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,160
a dozen places on youtube muhammad ali

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,360
gave me a

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,640
talk numerous times about

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,480
the word black and uh if you google

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,480
muhammad ali black and white you'll find

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,839
several versions of this and he says why

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,839
is it

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,000
yeah he says i used to ask my mom why is

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,279
it that white always represents goodness

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,560
in our society

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,200
why is angel food cake white but devil's

00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,920
food

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,640
cake is black and he's talking you know

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,839
he's he's

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,079
making this humorous but he's talking

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,240
about a very serious point that impacted

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,240
his psyche growing up as a kid

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,120
always seeing black associated with

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,120
negative things

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,800
um many people say we're used to these

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,560
old words they work fine for us

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,399
i don't find it offensive so it's a

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,160
waste of time

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,399
what is critical to remember here is

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,120
that you are not the gatekeeper on

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,839
other people's emotions you don't get to

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,720
say

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,079
what is or is not offensive to other

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,839
people now i tend to

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,200
i tend to try to avoid the word

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,040
offensive because

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,120
it gives this notion that people are

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,519
enraged about things and that's simply

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,640
not the case we're just talking about

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,640
daily uh daily

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,720
things that affect you in small ways

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,440
that build up over time and give people

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,160
a

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,240
a negative self image and if we remove

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,839
those things we can make our communities

00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,440
so much more welcoming

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,120
to beginners and we we want these

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,640
beginners in our communities this is

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,640
enlightened self-interest

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,640
we want people to join our projects

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,720
all right about that

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,880
um here's here's another another quote

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,920
from the uh the wisdom of twitter don't

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,839
tell people

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,040
what level of oppression they should be

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,040
comfortable with

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,000
don't tell them that they're not an

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,000
expert in their own

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,839
experiences

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,680
okay now here's here's a legitimate

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,120
objection if i change

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:42,399
the uh configuration variable blacklist

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,800
in my spam assassin software

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,720
then literally millions of people will

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,560
have to learn the new terms

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,240
they will have to learn the new ways to

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,720
configure things

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,639
now this is a legitimate objection but

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,639
there are two ways to address this one

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,720
is that you should have a deprecation

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,560
cycle particularly in software that is

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,320
widely deployed if you make this change

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,399
you need to support the old terminology

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,320
for a reasonable period of time

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,760
and deprecate it in a way that notifies

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,959
people that they're using a term that

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,720
will go away

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,800
that way you don't break massive

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,000
installations of software out there

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,320
and make life objectively worse for more

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,320
people

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,240
but you know in most real cases

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,639
you can replace the old words with the

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,360
new words in your configuration scripts

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,800
with a one

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,639
line said command um and

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,880
it's also important to remember as i

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,560
said all the way back at the beginning

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,040
it might be good for you to experience a

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,480
little inconvenience to remind you of

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,000
why we're doing this in the first place

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,399
to remind you

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,760
of the daily inconveniences that people

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,160
experience

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,160
that have these experiences that are not

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,360
yours

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,040
now this particular argument is one that

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,399
really gets under my skin people say

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,079
well if we

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:04,160
if we change blacklist to deny list

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,800
then pretty soon people won't be able to

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,480
use black ink anymore and

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,240
that sounds ridiculous but this is an

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,880
actual argument that was made

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,920
to me saying that we'll have to remove

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,360
the word black

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,279
we'll have to remove all color

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,320
designations from our software

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,000
ship everything in sepia tones uh which

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,320
may be offensive to other people and

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,680
this

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:29,120
this is uh a slippery slope argument

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:32,399
it's a logical fallacy it's not true

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,079
um but i i want to mention one thing if

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,519
if folks say

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,279
if we change this word we'll have to

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,279
change that word it's worth considering

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,399
whether that other word is itself a

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,440
problem

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,360
and uh i

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,839
you know you can't dismiss that when

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,000
when people say

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,360
uh maybe this other term is offensive as

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,440
well and i'm going to get back to that

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,240
in just a moment

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,600
because this entire process has has

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,959
educated me

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,440
and many others as to phrases and

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,120
concepts that are hurtful to people of

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,639
other cultures that

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,639
i'm completely ignorant of

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,079
so um

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,880
invariably when we talk about removing

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,040
the word

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,519
slave and blacklist from our software

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,639
someone will invoke orwell

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:27,199
someone will say that we are creating

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:30,320
newspeak that we are banning words

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:32,959
that this is this will lead inevitably

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,279
to not being able to speak because all

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,199
of our words are banned

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,320
um so i want to make a couple points

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:43,120
about that one is that orwell himself

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,320
um spoke at length wrote at length about

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,480
how

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,560
words shape reality if if we use words

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,000
that tell a group of people that they

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,120
are less than

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,560
then that becomes their reality

00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:01,760
and perception is in many senses

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:04,959
reality if we tell people every day

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:08,639
that uh their identity their blackness

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:11,279
makes them an evil bad less than

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,079
individual then that will affect their

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,480
psyche in profound ways

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,000
the other thing that i would bring to

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,800
your attention is that there are lots of

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,320
words

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:25,120
that we do not use in

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,079
software documentation we do not

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,040
routinely put

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,079
profanity in our software documentation

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,759
we do not

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:35,759
uh make religious analogies

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,920
in software documentation typically

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,639
because it calls out a group of people

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,399
and

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,880
and is can can be very oppressive

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,320
so this is this is not unique this is

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,199
about compassion

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,399
it's about finding words that describe

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,279
concepts

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,839
but don't harm your community in the

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,839
process

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,000
um i was i was having a conversation

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,079
with uh

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,199
an individual on twitter and and he said

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,360
look

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,399
this is great you should make this

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,000
change

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:14,399
but eventually we will have to spend

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,519
all of our time listening to what

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,199
offends people and

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,639
and compensating for it and this

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,759
actually struck me as very

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:24,880
unintentionally profound

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,759
as a community manager as a software

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,279
documentation

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:32,000
person um this is it's what i do

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,199
i i listen for things that are causing

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,120
roadblocks

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,320
in your life experience and i try to

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,399
remove those

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,600
and that's what that's what compassion

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,160
is compassion

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,600
is in fact a ceaseless circle of

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,040
listening to people

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,279
and trying to ease their discomfort and

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,240
that is so critical to the human

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,360
experience

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,519
compassion is not a checkbox

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,360
compassion is not something that you say

00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,279
okay i've done that i can move on to the

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:04,880
rest of my tasks it is

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:07,600
in fact an endless cycle

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,600
now um

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,000
at this point in the conversation people

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,640
tend to say folks are too easily

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,799
offended

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,919
people will find something to be

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,360
offended about

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:21,760
no matter what you do and

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,360
yeah this is this is objectively true

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,280
some people are just trying to pick a

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,160
fight and find something to be offended

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,079
about

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,919
and there does indeed come a point when

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,880
you cannot compensate for people that

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,720
are just trying

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,600
to cause trouble discerning which is

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,559
which

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,480
is also an endless cycle assuming good

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,000
intent is exhausting

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,880
but it is what we have to do as humans

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,160
to support one another we have to assume

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,280
good intent

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,240
or we will end up uh you know hating

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,400
everybody

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,919
and indeed being oppressive to everybody

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,640
as we think only of ourselves so that's

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,679
kind of

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,160
aspirational and and uh something that

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,280
indeed we all strive towards we all have

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,760
bad days

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,360
and that's the moment when you should

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,640
step away from the keyboard

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,520
and uh go work on your yard or something

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,640
because

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,960
not all of us can maintain compassion

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,679
all the time and that's just a reality

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,160
and and

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,080
sarah talked a little bit about this uh

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,280
in the last presentation

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:28,720
you you have to be willing to step away

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:31,840
when things become too contentious

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,960
but surely surely it is worth

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,640
making compassionate changes

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,720
in order to bring that one additional

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,240
person into your project who may be the

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,440
the person that comes up with the next

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,559
killer feature

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:50,320
um so yes i just mentioned this

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:53,679
but we we definitely should not

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,320
try to be the arbiters of language

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,039
now this particular uh part of the

00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,280
discussion

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,559
is is incredibly important because i

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,559
know that i'm speaking to an

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,160
international audience here and many of

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,039
you who are not

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,840
u.s americans on this presentation are

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,720
saying like this

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,240
is this is not about me this is a

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,600
specifically

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,520
uh united states concept that is

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,520
rooted in a particular time period and

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,360
indeed in the united states

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,520
there are people living today whose

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,679
grandparents were enslaved

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,440
this is the reality that we deal with

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,200
when we walk out the door

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,280
and we see people that don't look like

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,559
us we

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,559
we have to remember that their

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,160
cultural experience their historical

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,400
experience includes

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,160
these things that are still hurtful day

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,360
to day

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,919
but during this process

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,480
i have become educated myself about

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,200
things

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,480
that are that are culturally difficult

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,760
that are that are

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,480
harmful and oppressive

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,039
in many other cultures now i personally

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,440
grew up

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,039
in kenya in east africa so i'm i'm aware

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,240
of a set of

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:08,400
of cultural norms that are

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,280
you know shaped by the african continent

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,039
and by by the large immigrant population

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,880
that uh you know maybe some other people

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:18,000
wouldn't have seen but but during

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:21,280
this time people have educated me about

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,080
things that are that are problematic

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,559
to uh the european population based on

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,320
their

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:31,360
history of of international conflicts

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,280
and uh inter racial conflicts and and

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,480
inter tribal conflicts

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,159
and uh so yeah this particular thing

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,080
that i'm talking about right now i'm

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,120
focusing on blacklist and slave and that

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,159
is indeed

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,880
a u.s centric uh word choice

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,039
but these things exist everywhere and

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,400
once you start taking this seriously and

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,360
you look around at the

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,720
underrepresented people in your culture

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,919
those are going to be different from the

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,760
ones in mind

00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:01,120
and they are each a unique unrepeatable

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,480
individual

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:07,679
person just like you and you need to

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,799
treat them as such rather than as

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:14,480
as charles dickens said other p other

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,480
passengers on other journeys

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,280
now this one is particularly important

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,120
um i've been asked to

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,640
head up this effort at red hat there's

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,600
there's several of us that are working

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,840
at red hat

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,760
to remove the words blacklist and slave

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,320
and certain other things from all red

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,600
hat

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,840
products and services and you may very

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,400
legitimately say well this is a bunch of

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,640
white men

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,320
we're all white men in this project that

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,280
are trying to do this for

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,080
for press recognition and it is critical

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,480
for us

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,400
to not make it about that and you know

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,039
i'm even reluctant to give presentations

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,039
like that

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,880
by like this because it's all gay me i'm

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:54,080
doing this wonderful thing

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,640
um but

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,320
this is not just that and i and i hope

00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,760
that you hold our feet to the fire on

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,760
this i hope that you

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,760
keep us honest about this this is not

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,440
about us saying yay red hat

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,360
this is about trying to be more

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,159
welcoming and we hope

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,679
we hope that that red hat's reputation

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,080
supports that idea we hope that you

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,240
believe

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,480
us but if you find evidence to the

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,080
contrary please yell at us this is this

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,919
is important this is not about

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:24,080
the press um and and finally i think

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,919
this is my last point here uh people say

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,799
this doesn't fix racism of course it

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,640
doesn't

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:33,440
this is one tiny thing that i can do now

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,679
i can do it because i've been working in

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,080
open source documentation for

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,440
roughly 25 years this is what i've given

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,320
my life to it is a

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,159
i have a a unique set of skills and i

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,200
choose to apply them in this way

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:50,880
i can't change legislature i

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,480
cannot fix institutional poverty that

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,320
comes out of these problems

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:59,520
but what i can do is exercise my skill

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,360
big changes are comprised of many small

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,760
changes

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,000
those of us in open source this is just

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,280
one thing that we can do there's so many

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
others

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,559
and i don't want to imply for a moment

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,559
that this fixes anything it doesn't

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:18,159
it doesn't fix anything but it chips

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,159
away a tiny thing

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,640
some people say that making these

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,080
changes simply calls attention to the

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,400
negative connotations

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:30,080
and um in a sense that it it does

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,919
maybe it makes you feel uncomfortable

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,520
about these words maybe it makes you

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,520
uncomfortable the next time you read

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,559
your documentation and you see the word

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,480
slave there

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,559
and that draws attention to it and makes

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,320
you uncomfortable

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,000
maybe that will cause you to have a

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,159
little bit more compassion so i'm not

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,400
even sure that this is necessarily a bad

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,400
thing

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,240
and then of course there are people who

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,320
say well i walked up

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,840
the hill in the snow to school every day

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,400
and everyone else should have to as well

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,159
and i

00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,440
this is the point at which i stop having

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,960
the conversation

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,880
because if you have to explain to

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,159
somebody why they need to be

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,679
compassionate

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:10,400
then they may not be the target of your

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,400
conversation

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,240
i i also see a number of people who

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,200
phrase this

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,720
as this is simply political correctness

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,880
and does not have any practical

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,880
implications in the lives of real people

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,400
and i have anecdotes from

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,000
real people that say that it does make a

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,240
difference it makes them feel more

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,520
welcome in the community but

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,039
uh as as george bernard shaw said

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,559
you don't want to wrestle with a pig

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,440
because you both get dirty and the pig

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,320
likes it

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,880
and there are some arguments i make this

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,039
quote

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,159
uh simply to say there's some arguments

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:51,120
that just aren't worth your time to have

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,880
the people who say that things are

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,000
impossible shouldn't get in the way of

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,919
the people that are doing them

00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,440
now one thing that i've also discovered

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,080
through this process it's not new

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,400
information

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,720
i've known this for years if i get a

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,720
hundred positive feedbacks on this talk

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,799
and one person comes and says that i am

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,600
wasting my time in theirs

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,320
my mind because i have a human brain in

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,960
here

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,000
i'm gonna focus on that negative one and

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,960
uh

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,960
if you choose to join me in this effort

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,600
you're gonna get a lot of hate

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,440
and yeah hates the wrong word you're

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,440
gonna get a lot of pushback

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,600
because as i said many of these are are

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,640
good objections they are objectively

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,039
true

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,960
um but you need to learn you can train

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,240
yourself to focus on the positive again

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,200
as sarah mentioned

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,200
a half an hour ago

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,440
i want to close by saying that i have

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,559
focused on two words

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,320
i've focused on blacklist and slave

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,919
and the reason that i have focused on

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,760
this and the reason that our effort at

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,440
red hat is focusing on this

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,679
is because they are the ones that are

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,440
the easiest to explain

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,240
they are the ones that it's easiest to

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,200
show people why these are hurtful

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,279
and there are a lot of other words out

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,320
there that we use routinely

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,679
in documentation we use terms about

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,799
mental health

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:18,000
we use terms about physical

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:21,600
uh attributes in our documentation

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,240
we use the word he in every context when

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,720
we

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,279
are almost unaware that we're excluding

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,640
half of the human race by doing that

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:33,919
um we use colloquialisms like

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,200
uh wrestling with a pig and looking back

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,000
two slides

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,720
i left this slide in there intentionally

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,559
because

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,159
i know that some of you in the audience

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:45,200
saw that slide and thought

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,919
is he calling me a pig um

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,960
i wasn't but i just want to call

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,120
attention

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,760
by use of that analogy that there are

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,840
many words that we use routinely

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,520
and we just don't think about yeah it's

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,480
possible to go overboard on this it's

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,760
possible

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,320
to slip into into orwellian newspeak

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,679
that is an

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,279
actual possibility but we need to be

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,559
vigilant we need to make sure

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:13,279
that this is about compassion and not

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,120
about being the language police now i am

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,679
completely out of time and i'm sure that

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,279
marie

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,640
is uh is uh backstage wondering when

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:23,600
i'll stop talking

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,279
um i am done this is my reading list and

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,960
if you look at the bottom right corner

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,919
of this slide you'll see a link to my

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,240
slides

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:33,279
so that you can see these resources i'm

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,720
done murray i'll stop talking

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:39,440
uh that was great rich thank you so much

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:42,000
for that i really like that um

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,440
that last slide with the different axes

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,960
it is important

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,730
it's definitely important um so

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,120
are there any questions from

00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:54,799
[Music]

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,320
the comments here honestly just i'm sure

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,799
you weren't looking at the comments

00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,880
everyone was talking about um their

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,960
feelings about the different points

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,320
how they you know manage some of the

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,039
things

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,360
staying away from destructive problems

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,399
or

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:13,120
conversations uh more history plenty of

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:15,520
links in there

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,960
so it definitely was generating uh a

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,200
good conversation

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,360
i have a nice reading the transcript

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,320
right there's a nice quote here where is

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,840
it uh

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,760
listening to rich and then reading the

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,760
comments makes me happy we are a great

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,720
set of people

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,200
so i have to pat ourselves on the back a

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,300
little bit for that

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,200

00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,840
