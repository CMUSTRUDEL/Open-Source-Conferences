probably we can even start and then we

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:11,360
can wait for others to join later

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:14,400
yeah definitely so i'm curious um

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,960
when did we what was the

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,920
previous month or time period we used

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,000
for

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:25,760
fedora women's day usually if

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,880
it was september or october

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,560
because i think what we did as a month

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,719
it was september

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,559
when it was a week it was october

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,399
something like that but then we

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,160
decided that it's better to have a month

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,879
because it's easier for the organizers

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,640
to pick a date

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,160
i agree with that um

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,000
what do we think about putting in

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,320
october just to give ourselves some more

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,320
time

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,199
how about how about a rage

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,160
from october to november something like

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,280
that

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:05,040
i think one month seems long enough

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:08,880
yeah so i would say we also need

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,880
time to get the feedbacks from the

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,000
people and so on so i think one

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,479
month should be okay should we choose

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,640
october

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,640
yeah i was thinking of october as well

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:25,040
because there are many conferences since

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,920
september so probably october

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,079
will be a bit better and also something

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,640
that we were considering previous years

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,119
it was

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,920
when school would start so students

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,560
wouldn't have

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,600
exams and i remember that usually

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,880
september was

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,200
the time that they had exams and october

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,520
was a bit better

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,520
okay

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,640
uh that's true there is opens who say in

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,000
october open source

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,759
conference but that can be because

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,119
it's one month and that can be something

00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,399
that we can either

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,840
like do something with them

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,640
yeah i think that the fedora women's day

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,640
it wouldn't from what i my understanding

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,080
is it's like a two to three hour event

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,920
right yes right so

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,160
it wouldn't be like a whole conference

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,160
and and then we could invite people

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,840
from like the open souza conference to

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,599
come

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,080
to our fedora women's day as like a

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,360
social thing maybe

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,959
yeah definitely all right so

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,599
i put in october uh and justin was is

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,519
mentioning mid october is also fedora 33

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,959
release

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,480
good for fedora stuff it's a good time

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,680
to do it

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,440
or is it i think should we do it

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,840
making it harder because we might want

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,680
to be doing release parties

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,080
yeah and that's from like that's you

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,720
know me as a mind chair

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,400
rest right um bringing that point up

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,319
it's true people are interested in

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,000
fedora around them

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:06,560
um because uh

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,519
we can like people what they can do is

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,440
either

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,319
like maybe combining them both to a

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,200
release party and federal women

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,200
in one so

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,519
sure so we can celebrate the release

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,720
party at the federal women's day i do

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,319
think there's something to be said about

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,319
keeping them at separate events and

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,360
maybe this is just the

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,280
uh community or the manager in me or

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,440
something but

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,760
i like the idea of having a higher

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,959
number of events

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,799
so like if we you know us as fedora

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,840
community can say

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,239
we've ran this many fedora women's day

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,519
this many release parties it's a little

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,879
bit it's a

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,840
nicer story to tell about what we're

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,200
doing

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,560
and i also think like it would be nice

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,879
if we did

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,480
the fedora women's day and then the

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,480
release party like one

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,959
like one after each other right so if

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,959
if the release party is already gonna be

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,799
happening in october

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,080
we could do a thing where it's like

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,120
fedora women's day

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,079
is the end of september beginning of

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,440
october and we're getting

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,960
um we're getting people

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,880
interested so we're basically being like

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,320
oh we're doing this fedora women's day

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,759
it's an introduction for

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,240
um women to get like

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,000
okay a sense of our community a feel and

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,199
they get to know people a little bit and

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,240
say hey come to these release parties so

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,520
it could be a nice

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,800
amitabh hi

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,360
hello how are you hi so glad to see you

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,360
on camera

00:04:51,520 --> 00:05:00,160
i'm okay how are you we are doing fine

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,160
nice um

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,000
so i was thinking like the fedora

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,520
women's day could be a prep for

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,039
for the women that we're trying to bring

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,759
in to get you know to feel more

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:13,919
comfortable going to the release parties

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,880
so that's my that's my thought if we did

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,479
it either

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,800
i know we're like oh give us more time

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:22,560
to do in september but maybe

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,680
we need to look at the scope of the work

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:29,039
to see if it's feasible for september we

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,039
are at the beginning of august

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,800
justin hello i'm still eating breakfast

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,280
but i'm here

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,960
yes so uh i'm thinking that

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,560
i mean there are many people who gonna

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,680
do the release party right

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,639
uh but for fedora women's day this is

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,840
the group who

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:53,759
writes this particular event so

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,479
um my idea is to focus on fedora women's

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,800
day first

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,039
and then we can think of the release

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,919
party if there is any benefit

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,280
for that because if we concentrate more

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,120
on the release party

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:10,000
we might slip the woman day

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,280
event i'm not sure now the team is

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,800
bigger so if

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,720
we have the bandwidth to accommodate

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,199
both the event that will be great

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,240
but the first focus should be the

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,840
woman's day

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,280
that's my uh opinion yeah definitely i

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,639
think it was just a matter of

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,240
timing like we don't want it to compete

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,960
with the release parties

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,080
and the release of the new fedora and we

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,560
also want to

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,720
you know time it well so that it makes

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,919
sense so i'm i'm in agreements with you

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,000
i'm not worried about

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,759
release parties to talk about for this

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,240
but it's a matter of

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,240
timing

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,800
so my thought was we just need to like

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,680
understand the scope of the work to see

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,280
if we could get it done before september

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,599
we could just say like the last two

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,960
weeks of september are when the events

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,560
can happen

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,000
and somewhere around there we can work

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,000
with with folks

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
to do you know what they need to do

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,720
if we can um choose the

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,319
second half of september i think can be

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,039
better for us just because

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,400
like for now there are not many things

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,599
that we need to do before

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,360
but for example the resource pack that

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,240
is needed for the organizers

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,120
and some others they will need some time

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,759
and

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,160
i'm afraid that we need to rush a lot in

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,039
case

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,840
we do it for beginning of september but

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,000
if we say

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,960
second half of september i think that's

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,960
doable for us

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,560
it's a little bit more time frame to

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,080
coordinate and everything so looking at

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,440
the calendar

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,720
um the weekend of like

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:58,319
the 25th of september maybe

00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:01,039
through the weekend of the 11th

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,720
are like the so basically putting three

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:06,479
weekends on the calendar

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:09,680
as options so the

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:13,840
a period of the

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,840
26th through the 11th

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,360
does that make sense

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:25,360
yes i'm just checking that

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,319
dustin was mentioning that maybe someone

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,199
said that they need

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:33,279
october i'm sorry what was that

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,279
uh justin in the chat was mentioning

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,519
that in case we can also

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,560
like if someone wants to do it in

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,360
october

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,839
right we can either include some days

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,279
from october or we can say that is the

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,279
one of special case

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:55,360
generally we do it in one month so we

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:57,839
can specify that during this month we um

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,760
get these many federal menstrual or the

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,680
release party across the globe

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,399
so that makes more impact

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,240
in terms of statistics when we share it

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,360
but yeah if there is a

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,640
any special exception uh to do it in one

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:18,399
of october then we can consider that

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,880
also um are we changing any pattern

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,399
i mean obviously we will be doing it for

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,440
sure uh

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,640
but are we changing any major rules

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,880
which we used to follow for uh for the

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:35,440
women's day earlier like um

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,000
getting the proposals and then approving

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,920
them

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,720
and so well the changes mostly it will

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,640
be that

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,519
now for example they will just need to

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,920
submit their

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,640
request but it's not that they will ask

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,640
for budget so it's not a big

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,160
i don't know uh it doesn't need a lot of

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,920
efforts from our side to say

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,200
plus one or no because basically they

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,040
will just say that

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,079
here is the agenda that we have the

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:05,120
dates and where it could be organized

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,600
uh so i think it's less work from this

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,200
point

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:12,480
but mostly it's a bit more work on the

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,680
global organizing team uh on having some

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,760
clear metrics

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:21,360
on having graded this tech

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,200
on making sure that we would use hopping

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,680
for example as a platform

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,760
for the organizers and all this i think

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,560
now it's a bit more work on the global

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,480
organizing in the beginning

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,800
but on the local organizers it's not

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,279
that it needs from our site a lot of

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,240
approval because it's just the date and

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,240
we will speak there

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,720
oh and as we will be we were used to

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,079
distribute the resource pack

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,920
uh i'm sure that that we can use still

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,480
but do we want to make some changes to

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,519
it or considering the release

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,680
the new release oh what do you guys

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,920
think

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,680
i think it's good uh the dates that

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,399
maria was mentioning to do it like

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,720
before

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,399
the release parties and then we can

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,600
leave the time for release parties to

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,200
happen

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,880
i think you were meaning like should we

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:18,000
update the resource pack with new info

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:21,680
that's right on on the new releases

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:29,120
um justin i think we have a ticket

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:31,200
is this for updating yes

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,839
are we taking uh the meeting notes

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,120
somewhere do we have the agenda document

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:40,160
i think that's uh yeah in the chat

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,959
okay thank you so much just opened i

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,720
i was a bit late i'm sorry for that no

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,720
worries

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,720
my baby suddenly needs pasta and

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,959
i was asking her from uh like from the

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,720
one hour

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,240
before the start time of this meeting

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,880
and she was not hungry

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,880
and apparently exactly at the meeting

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,320
time she needs needed pasta

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:10,639
so can you imagine

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:13,360
yes i can imagine definitely

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,519
and that's why i i just miss in person

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,040
flock

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:25,839
i am um eating a wreath eating

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,839
i'm reading this um this ticket here

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,959
um just sorry to interrupt but before

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,240
that

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:38,480
so can we so are we like set

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,000
on having the duration from september

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,000
25th to october 11th

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,440
yeah i think it's a good day okay and

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,560
then

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,480
we have let's say a week of buffer if

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:57,200
someone wants to stretch it

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:59,440
beyond that duration we cannot

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,240
we can promote the dates that we have

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,639
now

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,320
and in case the organizer says that they

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,519
really need another date we can be

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,200
flexible

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,040
but we can promote the dates that we

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,639
have on the document

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:16,240
all right okay so

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:19,760
i'm a newbie what kind of

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,320
like uh just looking at the next item on

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,639
the agenda talking about the duration

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,880
just makes me wonder like what is a

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,560
normal agenda or

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,120
what normally happens at a fedora

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,079
woman's day

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,880
well usually it starts i mean it depends

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,480
usually we

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,040
lift up to the organizers but we try to

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,440
suggest to have a general

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,920
presentation about fedora as a community

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,800
and how people can be part of it and so

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,600
on

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,480
and then usually they have presentation

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,120
about women in open source for example

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,600
uh why we are organizing fedora women's

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,360
day

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,440
and then it's really up to the

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,600
organizers what speakers they have

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,959
they can be a bit more technical they

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,160
can be more general

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:09,360
but usually i mean

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:12,639
it's not that we put any limit

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,279
and uh also the duration because it was

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,839
also

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,760
um feedback that we got from the

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,120
participants last year

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,040
the duration is not really up to us

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,240
because some of them were saying that

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,399
they needed longer and so on but

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,199
it's really up to the organizers how

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:35,040
many speakers they will find

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:37,440
how hands-on they want to do it or no

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,639
networking time that because usually in

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,480
the end they also

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,199
calculate some networking time with

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,079
attendees

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,600
um i think i might have a rough estimate

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,519
as to the duration

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,160
so like looking back at the previous

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:56,000
feedback given for 2019

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,320
for okay so my fwd was two hours long

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,959
and

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,160
the feedback was that it's too long and

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,279
i think there was an

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,480
fwd at aurangabad i think amit that okay

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:09,279
if i'm not wrong and they said that they

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,560
um they needed a little more time or

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,800
maybe it was

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,079
somewhere so if amita you could tell us

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,320
how long yours went

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,680
so we could have a rough idea as to

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,560
what's the

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,519
best one so we coordinated with the

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,480
facilities

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,240
earlier uh before the event day and we

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,120
collected the expectation from the

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,320
students that

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,000
what they want how how they want and

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,079
which topics they want to hear

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,320
more about so uh we noted that down

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,680
we worked on the slides and

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,160
presentations so

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,079
we started the coordination much earlier

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,920
than the event date with the faculties

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,240
of that college which we visited on the

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,399
day

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,839
of the event so that's why it went a

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,079
little bit smoother

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:57,360
uh and uh and the duration was like

00:15:54,079 --> 00:16:00,480
we reached there um later

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,199
in the morning 11 ish 11 a.m

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,839
and then we finished it like by three

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,560
and four

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,560
in the afternoon so what happens is when

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:12,000
you start talking uh

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,320
you you you prepared a slight deck of

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
half an hour or 45 minutes but then the

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,880
interaction happens

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,720
people start asking questions and that

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,000
is the most important part i feel

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,759
so we never try to you know rush through

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,639
the presentation which we have prepared

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,399
in fact

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,120
we um indulge more in the interaction

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,839
part

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,800
uh and sometimes we deviate from the

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,839
slides

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,639
we have prepared we we don't go there in

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,480
fact

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,480
the conversation is going in some other

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,800
direction so so we follow the path

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,519
in that direction so that is how it went

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,240
so

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,440
i'm sorry it's not the exact answer to

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,880
the question we

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,720
i but this is i think yeah i think so

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,040
something that i took away from that is

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,120
that

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,720
if the event is interactive enough they

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,440
won't feel it's long

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,720
right exactly exactly and it was also in

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,559
the feedback that some

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,079
events weren't as interactive as they

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,600
should have been

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,520
so that's why maybe they were feeling

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,600
long right so

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,079
never try to finish the content you have

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,079
prepared

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,240
just try to go with the flow because you

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,760
need to make that connection and bond

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,760
with the audience so that they

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,160
they feel connected and they feel

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,160
confident enough about the event

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,439
so yeah that what happened that was

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,799
happened in the

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,960
last mistake

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,960
are

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:47,120
do we have a link to the resource pack

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:51,760
yes yes it is also at the agenda i think

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:54,799
okay here it is i see links you

00:17:51,760 --> 00:18:00,720
found it thanks guys yeah all right i

00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:04,160
just want to review this for a minute

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:07,280
but we should update it definitely

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,280
because it's a bit hot

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,240
can i put it in the chat just in case

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,400
so for duration we could just say that

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,120
whatever duration you feel

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,160
uh is up to your local measure but be

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,280
ready to keep it

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,919
interactive so i had an idea

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,600
as part of the resource pack something

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:33,440
we could add in there

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:36,880
would be like example sessions

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:40,960
so it could be anything from like

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:45,280
you know social time to

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:50,160
people giving presentations about a

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,160
specific topic um to

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,760
uh maybe like some interactive games

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,000
like

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,960
i don't know if anyone here got to go to

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,919
the

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,760
bingo or the pub quiz but those were

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,000
actually really fun

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,160
um we could do like we could do like

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,160
slideshow karaoke like we could give

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,600
people examples of things that they

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,080
could do

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,400
during the event and add that into the

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,760
resource pack

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,760
what do you guys think of that idea

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:25,200
um i mean it depends on

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,080
which which part of the country belongs

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,240
to

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,760
we i'm not sure how many people are

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,360
aware of

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,919
which games or for i mean the

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,840
kind of qualities they're not resource

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,440
we would be like here's yeah how to do

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,559
this

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,960
and their net specifically in india

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,559
uh the kind of colleges we were going

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,919
they are very

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:53,120
i mean what to say

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:56,640
very small villages or

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,440
very small remote areas we used to

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,720
go in where people have very less

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,720
bandwidth

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:07,919
you know and network is flaky so

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,240
um it decide is great for where

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,000
the people have good bandwidth and they

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,200
are used to of these games but

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,600
i'm not sure if it works well here right

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,679
well i mean i think the idea is to

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,200
give inspiration and we could give

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:25,200
inspiration that

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:28,080
directly um would work for those

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,960
for that crowd of people right so you

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,000
know what

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,400
what what do you think works well for

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,280
that demographic we can totally include

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,240
that into these

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,159
it's like ideas it's not that having

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,159
them there means you have to do them

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,520
it's more of a here's inspiration

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,080
because i think that

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,200
this is a new thing for people and they

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,760
might have a hard time

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,559
imagining like what am i going to do

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:56,159
virtually for three hours

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:59,679
right so this is inspiration for people

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,840
they don't have to follow

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,679
something particular so again i'm

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,880
curious what kind of examples like what

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,960
do you think would be

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,760
most well-suited to the demographic

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,760
you're working with

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:21,120
i'm curious if you have any ideas

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:24,720
yeah pictionary i'm aware of that

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,039
i'm not sure how many college i i mean

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,400
nowadays they are very advanced i'm not

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,840
sure if your google

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,840
or survey

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,480
in advance will help it at certain

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,200
places

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,120
to know what exactly they want we heard

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,240
it many times from the faculties

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,720
but uh it

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,559
asking directly from the students by

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:54,559
sending them survey

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:54,559
might be a good option as well

00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,679
all right so i'm actually going down to

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:03,120
like what point it is

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:05,520
it's under global organizing team

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,280
responsibilities i realize i just jumped

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,600
ahead on the agenda

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,840
so i'm just putting that here provide

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,400
ideas and

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,360
for what to do during virtual events and

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,120
then we can

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:22,799
go back to the agenda sorry for

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,799
all right that's cool yeah

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,280
yeah so i think the main question when

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,600
we when

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,480
jonah and i were making this agenda was

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,679
that

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,440
when we talk about a global fwt

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,039
organizing team so are we saying that

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,159
there's going to be one

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:42,720
global event and or

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,360
is it going to be one global event where

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,400
we

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,559
where we coordinate with other open

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,840
source communities like how justin is

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:54,080
trying to get genome on board or is it

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,400
going to be that whatever i just said

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,440
plus we'll have local organizers doing

00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,120
their own mini

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:04,400
watch fedora women's day virtually

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,520
like it has been happening so because

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,159
then

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,280
if it's if it's not the third option

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,559
then we don't have

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,960
to take the headache of having um

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:17,600
you're not calling for speakers for

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:21,600
local events

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:25,200
so i want to put one um

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:29,280
point out here that should happen

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,559
is not hard to use or to set things up

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,080
but it definitely it

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:36,159
takes time now for

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,120
nest obviously it's like a three-day

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,600
event with like

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,640
50-something sessions like it won't be

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,760
that

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,080
but um i think what i would want to do

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,760
is train a couple people

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,760
on how to use it on the dna

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,440
like you know out of the organizers for

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,760
fedora women's day

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,279
so we can kind of share setting them up

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,840
if we do

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,360
multiple events you have to think about

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,799
okay like

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,200
you know we're gonna have to set each

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,880
one of these up i don't think that we

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,919
can actually like we'll

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,880
outline all the information that we need

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,480
from the organizer of the local event

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,279
but we're still the ones i think we're

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,559
gonna need to navigate this system

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:23,840
and it's primarily going to be

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:26,640
me and once i train you guys like

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,200
hopefully you know so there is this

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,720
workload that we have to think about

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:35,200
there is also if we did it as one like

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,760
long event right the thing we need to

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,039
think about

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:42,159
for that is that happen has

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:45,039
a maximum of 72 hours

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,320
at foreign events now you can you can do

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:50,799
as many events

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:53,200
right but each registration

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,240
does have a cost so that that is like

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,440
part of our budget

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,679
but it's not a high cost it's like

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,400
anywhere from like two to six dollars i

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,480
don't know exactly what ours will be

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,120
i will get back to you guys with that

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,400
but there's that cost to think about so

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:13,440
if we did do like say we did

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,320
a um three hour

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,400
of sorry a three-day event over one of

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,200
the prime weekends

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,880
and we did sessions in that event for

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,080
each one of the local fedora women's

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,320
days

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,000
and then if folks had one outside of

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,120
that three-day event we could just set

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,640
up mini ones

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,320
for just them um and they're local

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,799
you know and if other people can join

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,360
obviously totally welcome

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,559
but we could try to reduce the amount of

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,640
registrations

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,640
by putting it in a three-day period

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:53,200
that's that would be a cost efficiency

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:57,840
option which is definitely something we

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,840
should think about

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:11,360
that should have been the first question

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:13,520
before the duration first

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,640
maybe we can do even something with the

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,960
dates i don't know

00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,760
because what i'm thinking of if we make

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,559
like the

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:25,600
three days uh how we will also make it

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,480
easier for people to find at which one

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,159
they should

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:33,120
register and so on well

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,240
this is the thing if it's a three-day

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,840
event

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,080
they just have to register for the one

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,440
event

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:44,080
right and then there's a schedule

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,760
and you can like that's not it's

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,279
honestly not very intuitive

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,520
and this is some feedback i'm going to

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,039
give hop in but there is a

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,559
button where you can add it to your

00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,799
calendar so

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,919
the idea would be like you're not

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,600
registering

00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,360
you don't know you don't have to worry

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,080
about which one to register for you

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:06,240
register for the fedora women's day

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:08,640
and then you go to the session

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,559
that you want to go to and we could also

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,080
do things like we have here like

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:16,000
testing the audio video hallway tracks

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,240
that kind of thing so people can hang

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,919
out in between

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,840
um and we could do you know like

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,120
it could be spaced out but i think it's

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,960
really going to be dependent on the

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,320
organizers and what they can

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:33,600
do right and oh go ahead

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:36,320
no sure i mean after you uh just that

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,440
it would be good it's actually nice that

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,640
we're all kind of

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,000
in different time zones because i would

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,080
say that

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,520
we're probably not going to give admin

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,080
access

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:53,279
to local organizers

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,399
so someone probably does need to be like

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,159
around

00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,919
for at least some of the time and have

00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,760
like a good way for

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,520
people to communicate to us if there are

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:05,360
issues luckily

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:07,760
after using the ernest i don't foresee

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,399
there is a cap on admin seats and hop in

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,000
justin

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:15,120
it so the other thing is

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,640
once we get to our

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,159
own account which i don't know if you

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,480
guys know the story but

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,279
like osbo is working on getting an

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,640
account for

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:26,320
oslo within red hat and uh the contract

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,799
ended up taking really long

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,679
so we're working with the apache

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,720
foundation

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:37,039
on their account because of you know

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,039
things going through procurement

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,559
so anyway once we have that other

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,159
account

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,080
it will be an account that we're sharing

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,720
with ospo that being said

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,960
i can fully make them aware okay we're

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,679
doing this fedora women's day event

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,960
and we'll have as many spots available

00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,559
um

00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:01,600
as in the admin um

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:04,960
admin slots available right so i think

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,080
i need to see how osbo manage their

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,120
contract

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,679
because adding additional sponsor seats

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,799
does cost money and it adds money to

00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,000
each register

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:17,919
registration so that's kind of

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,600
not a detail that i was involved in

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:24,240
negotiating

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:26,480
so the minimum is 10 at a time

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,480
the thing about sharing it with ospo is

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,520
there might be people with an osbo who

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,720
need to be

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,960
having access to that right um

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,080
and changing it is not as easy as

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,279
turning on a button

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,600
or flipping a button for us we have to

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,480
be in touch with hoppin so that they can

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,039
change the

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,159
slots so there is some amount of

00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,200
coordination

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:51,120
behind the scenes for that i did not

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,720
i was not about to make this a hobbit

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,039
how to hop in

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,039
work

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,480
uh when oscar will have their account

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,480
and so on

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,799
uh i'm hoping within the next couple

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,440
weeks i mean this is a process

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,480
i was working on for a while and we kind

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,480
of thought it would be

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:17,520
quick it was not quick very long

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,440
and i actually only got access to start

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,440
setting things up and even figure out

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:26,480
like how it works like three weeks ago

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,760
so like the last week has been so

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,600
intense getting

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,159
everything set up but now i'm like you

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:36,080
know on my way to expert

00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:39,279
so it's good um

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:42,320
so anyway looking good good

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:45,360
uh it'll be nice to have admins

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,320
uh geographically distributed

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,799
because then we don't want somebody to

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,240
be

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,559
awake in us while there is a event going

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,360
on

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,080
in apec region because you see the time

00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,559
zone

00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,960
it's a daylight difference i'm not sure

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:04,080
in osprey if we have

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,880
anybody from apec regions

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,440
oh we need to we need to check that and

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:14,000
we need to coordinate with gospel that

00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,000
uh they should make sure well

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,159
i want to get you like so i want to

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,679
train people here

00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:27,519
on this team to use it i'm okay with

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:30,840
like i have trust i know you guys um

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,159
to use this platform so i'm talking

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:36,880
about

00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:41,600
uh local organizers that are not us

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,600
someone having some major sound feedback

00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:49,360
not sure who it is okay that's better

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,720
okay so right so i do want to train you

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,039
guys so like amita

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,080
you are in the eight pack region you

00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,799
could be the contact

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,279
you could be the person who's in hop in

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,480
as an

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:04,159
admin for that event right

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,880
i'm in houghton yes yes exactly

00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,080
i'm in you know east coast time iona's

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,840
probably central

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:14,880
eastern european summer time

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,039
yeah you have to sleep so we're covering

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,399
quite a few right now and like justin

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,679
obviously we got b

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,320
we've got eureka like we got plenty of

00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,840
us

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,559
so i think we could do something like

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,360
this

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,559
where we just jump on a call and we got

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:35,600
time zoned

00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:37,840
um i'm gonna call and i can walk through

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,640
a lot of the stuff with you it's pretty

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,679
intuitive

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,480
there's some parts that are not so

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,760
intuitive

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,120
but i just whatever

00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,960
hop in we'll get there it's actually a

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,559
very new company it's only like four or

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,880
five months old or something like that

00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,399
but

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,559
i think feel like this is the best

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:58,559
platform i've used so far so

00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,320
for a virtual conference what do you

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:03,440
think

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:06,399
it's very good so it's working i mean

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,919
it's very impressive i see the polls and

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,799
booths and social

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,080
and everything it's impressive maybe for

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,480
my next virtual

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,519
i mean for the qe one which got

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,679
cancelled open

00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,559
this one maybe i'll try something

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,600
similar

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,600
or maybe this one

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:31,039
we're doing a three-day event

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,039
with sessions for different time zones

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:41,200
and also from option one

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,200
and option two

00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,840
um

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,000
what do people think about that

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,120
i think the first one should be well i

00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:08,960
was thinking we could do both

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,639
like this is the option for people to be

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,480
a part of like you have this option or

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,919
you have that option

00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,960
oh sorry if i interrupted somebody

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:21,599
yeah i was saying something nope

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,679
so for the second option uh i don't

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,560
think it it's even needed to

00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,720
have this thing that you can that you to

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,800
do it on hopkins if let's say they're

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,599
not able to participate in a three-day

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,320
event

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,040
then local organizers just could set up

00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,960
their own

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,679
i don't know maybe google meet or

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,520
whatever platform they prefer

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,960
i mean it's flexible on everyone's side

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,079
then let's say for some reason they

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,399
couldn't

00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,639
get themselves to organize it in that

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:51,359
three days law that we gave them because

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,520
right now we were opting for maybe a

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,040
week or two weeks of duration

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,399
for some reason if it doesn't happen

00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,160
then they can always go with whatever

00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:01,200
platform they want

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,680
yeah i think that's good

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,920
and it reduces um i i could not get

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:10,079
properly what what she's just said

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:12,960
okay sorry sorry so i said that

00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,240
uh if we opt for option two as an

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,760
alternative

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:20,320
then the local organizers don't need

00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,480
hopkins as a platform they can always go

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,280
for their own preferred platform maybe a

00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,480
zoom call or

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,119
google me and conduct it at their own

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,800
leisure

00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:33,920
or whenever it is suitable for them

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,760
yeah only one thing that uh we were

00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,480
speaking also today at come out

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,040
session it was that it might be a bit

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,359
easier

00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,079
to use hoping to know how many people

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,280
will get

00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,720
and follow up with them because this was

00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,920
something that we were

00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,000
lacking of previously like we couldn't

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,839
uh like here we can use the polls for

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,520
example and so on but previously it was

00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:59,839
very hard to know how many people

00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:03,200
uh attended

00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,200
it's a really good point you know

00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,119
also it's recorded here just

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,320
automatically

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:17,280
if you set it up that way um

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,280
so that's another good point yeah

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,359
i'm torn but you know some people might

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,160
just

00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:29,920
want to do their own thing like justin

00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,640
mentioned in the comments

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,599
um you know some people prefer to

00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,520
organize

00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:41,119
things their own way so i think

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:43,760
like i this is my feeling

00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,520
say we can do 20 fedora women's days

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,040
sessions or events or however we want to

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,119
look at it

00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,240
i think we could get at least half of

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,079
them

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:56,320
to stay land on that weekend

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,160
right i mean like where's where are

00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,280
people going what are people doing

00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,480
right now i don't know crying in the

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:07,760
corner

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:09,599
like i mean honestly it's in

00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,160
september whatever we'll choose a

00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,960
weekend i guess but

00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,440
i mean people really aren't going that

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,839
far and if we've chosen

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:24,960
um the weekend in advance we can

00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:27,040
properly advertise is happening

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,359
and get you know so people aren't making

00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,800
plans for that weekend

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,720
plans i don't know what plans are

00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,440
anymore but yeah

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,480
so i had a question in this heyday event

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,800
will we also

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,760
target that having that collaboration

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,520
with genome

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,520
or is that going to be a separate event

00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,599
later

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,720
yeah actually this was something that

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,000
when we

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:52,560
had the coordination with uh

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,880
i think uh we were thinking that maybe

00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:58,400
apart from local ones we can have

00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,240
even one global that we can organize it

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,960
in collaboration with other communities

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,119
like gnome is one of them but maybe we

00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,599
can ask even others like i don't know

00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,960
libreoffice opensuse and others i think

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:12,000
they would be

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,599
very open to um

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,079
to work on it and to do something

00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,079
together

00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,440
because something that we were thinking

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,400
maybe even justin i'm not sure if he can

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,200
uh join is that i'm not sure like how

00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,359
exactly

00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,480
would be the collaboration with gnome if

00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:32,800
they will collaborate like in local ones

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,320
but that depends like how many local

00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,320
ones it will be and so on

00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,599
or it will make more sense to have like

00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,599
one global one yeah

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:48,880
okay so in that case just

00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,880
suggesting linux women's day

00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,440
maybe next year in person

00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:05,440
uh i just made some notes on the agenda

00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:08,720
options for local organizers

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:12,960
uh for me it will be great to have

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:16,160
the speakers from other

00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:20,560
communities and countries because

00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,560
uh niharika can

00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:28,000
you know can give her feedback on this

00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:30,160
but students here are very fascinated by

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,079
why the speakers from other countries

00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,760
and

00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:38,720
they get impressed when

00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,240
people like just i i talk a lot i always

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,560
talk about justin

00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,440
whenever i go to any event i show his

00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,079
picture

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,119
i tell his age i tell what whatever he

00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,800
does so did this

00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:54,480
impress them a lot so it'll be great if

00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,800
we get such speakers and

00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,640
they they get inspired they listen to

00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,920
these stories people connect to the

00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,440
stories more

00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:07,200
than the than anything else so yes it's

00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,200
a brilliant idea to have all the

00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,839
sessions

00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,520
do we think we could move on to the next

00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,880
agenda point

00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:24,000
yeah just wanted to add that

00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,480
uh because regina if this is the first

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,200
time there is a collaboration actually

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,480
even

00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,480
previously maybe not officially but

00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,880
we organized the federal women's day in

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:39,839
munich and it was together with

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:44,079
marina that was representing open school

00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:46,640
no it was like a collaboration with them

00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:49,599
so i had a hard time hearing you sorry

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,839
anytime you did you

00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,800
momentarily but can you say that again

00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,680
jonah

00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,079
uh i was saying that uh previously uh

00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,480
bee

00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,920
did uh federal women day in munich it

00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,200
was together with marina

00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,119
uh he represented susan libroffice

00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,599
community

00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,240
like this was kind of a collaboration

00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,760
that we did

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,800
but uh it was like just in the small

00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,640
scale let's say

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,960
you know small in one of the federal

00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,520
women's they needed to organize

00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,440
yeah and i just want to say we also had

00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,640
one another speaker with

00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,280
from the mozilla as well from portland

00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,000
so

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,800
it was like a collaboration between all

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,640
three

00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,880
different things so it was not just

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,520
about like joining the fedora community

00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,640
as

00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,720
like as a contributor but like overall

00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,200
about the open source one

00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,960
but i didn't really so i just reached

00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,200
out to them like

00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,319
because they were in my network before i

00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,960
didn't really like

00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,760
talk to the communities about having a

00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,880
whole plan

00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,880
on how to collaborate

00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:03,839
i think we can cool so we can ask

00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,599
i like that idea justin no no you are

00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,599
unmuted

00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,280
you muted me i did because

00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,240
there's people there's a lot of noise in

00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,440
the background

00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,839
and i said that i did um

00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,800
but you never told me that then you're

00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:41,280
gonna unmute me

00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,280
okay just a one quick uh suggestion

00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,440
that's okay one quick suggestion that

00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,640
about uh what we just said

00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:52,960
uh because she was connected already

00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:55,280
somebody was on her network that that's

00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,920
how he she was able to pull in that

00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,319
speaker in the fedora wednesday can we

00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,119
send

00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:02,400
these emails asking that if if somebody

00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:06,400
knows already

00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:09,520
uh people from uh other communities

00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,760
in fedora circle so they can we and they

00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:15,280
can help us invite them in this

00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,520
federal military to deliver a session

00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,800
like from ghana we already have the

00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,160
connections

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,800
other communities some other open source

00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,800
communities

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:31,280
i can invite people from libreoffice

00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,280
community as well

00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,599
and i'm sure that they they can help but

00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,040
yeah it will just depend

00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,760
uh how many local ones we will have and

00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,160
when

00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,119
they will have the chance to jump in and

00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,520
help

00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,240
but i like justin's idea that we can

00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,359
just

00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:52,400
have a cfp and then people can

00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,880
just propose like talks or if they want

00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,640
to be an

00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:59,280
organizer they can just propose that

00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,119
so we can also share that link over to

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:05,760
different mailing lists

00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:08,720
sorry no worries absolutely no worries

00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:11,040
um and i kind of forgot what i was going

00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,040
to say

00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:17,599
what is christian oh i don't know

00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,880
yeah well i was also going to say that

00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:21,680
for the cfp

00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,079
i think it's going to be a little bit

00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,599
more

00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:28,240
of us explicitly inviting people

00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,599
that we know we want to talk i think i

00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,880
mean some people

00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,119
there will be a few motivated

00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,680
individuals but

00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,520
i think like the local organizers should

00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:40,240
be thinking of people that would

00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,440
that can talk to their local community

00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,160
right yeah

00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,680
so it's not necessarily that we're just

00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,839
expecting a bunch of

00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:52,160
things to come in per se

00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:54,480
um but yes a cfp would be a good way to

00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:57,760
do it

00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,680
um i yes explosiveness they do so

00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,440
and then i think that for ashland's

00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,359
question i think that it's maybe a

00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,720
bigger conversation so i think what we

00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:07,760
should do with this

00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,880
is add it into our notes and say that we

00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,079
need to explain

00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:15,680
or clarify a little bit of the roles

00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:17,599
of what we are you know as the dni team

00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,680
are doing with fedora women's day

00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:22,079
and then what the what we expect of like

00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:25,119
a local organizer what we expect

00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:27,359
what uh you know what they'll need or

00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,040
et cetera et cetera from a local

00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:32,079
organizer i think outlining that

00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:35,599
is important so i'm just copying her

00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:38,160
um the comment here and i'm putting it

00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,160
in the notes

00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:44,079
i'm not sure where at the bottom live

00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,079
notes

00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,960
okay so i kind of want to try to

00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:54,319
just point out that we should stick to

00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,319
this we should try to

00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,640
stick to our agenda

00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:05,200
at the scratch goals um under

00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,720
the call for there are women the

00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,119
organizers

00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,079
because there is the article that nasi

00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,440
wrote

00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,079
that we can specify there like what is

00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,960
the difference

00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:18,960
between the global organization

00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:33,280
um okay so shall i just point out the

00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,280
next agenda point

00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,359
uh right so over here like i'm going

00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,319
into global organizing team

00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:42,160
responsibilities the first point

00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:45,440
feedback from organizers

00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:48,640
i think from point a b c b

00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:51,839
they're all kind of uh

00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:53,440
they've been discussed and i mean if

00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:55,520
someone wants to point out anything

00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,839
else apart from these four points that

00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,839
they can

00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:04,960
i have i have a question yeah people

00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:07,520
wanted less pictures

00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,240
no they wanted more pictures so that's

00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,119
not clear

00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,079
more picture less text so i think what

00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,520
you want to say is more

00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:17,440
pictures yes so usually what people end

00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,720
up doing is let's say they have a slide

00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,559
and they have

00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,760
maybe three bullet points and a

00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,359
supporting picture

00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,960
and those bullet points have text and

00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:26,960
they're like whole sentences

00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,160
we want to do and then what they end up

00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,400
doing is they i mean

00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,079
maybe because it's lack of them speaking

00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,960
at events so for whatever reason they

00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,280
end up speaking

00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,720
just looking at the entire slide and

00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,240
reading it through

00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:41,200
instead they could just talk around

00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:43,359
their slide and have an outline of text

00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:46,400
so that it is kind of becoming more

00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,400
interactive i guess

00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,440
i think that's a great suggestion but

00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,800
also it depends on the speaker

00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,280
because like you can give it as a

00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,960
suggestion to the speaker but

00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,440
it depends how is the way how they

00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,440
present

00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:05,680
yeah yeah sure i mean that was

00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,280
something they were just thinking about

00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,920
but maybe we can keep this in mind

00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,440
especially

00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:15,520
in the general slides that we wanted to

00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:21,119
uh hate us thing that we wanted to

00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:24,400
do yeah we should take a picture

00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:27,599
click right now we have yeah

00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:30,400
just few minutes i need to prepare to

00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:33,119
learn for the family

00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,880
so if anybody else who is there in the

00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:40,000
session please

00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:42,640
join us and please switch on your camera

00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,800

after

00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,960
yeah just really we have

00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:06,400

i am

00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,559
thing but i also feel like maybe i

00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,960
should

00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,640
stay here this this might need my

00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:32,720
attention more than that

00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:36,240
i'll probably watch that later huh yeah

00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:39,119
okay a lot of nerds talking

00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:41,760
nerd all right so i'm going to take a

00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,520
quick bath and break

00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,599
do we want to take a five minute break

00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:50,720
actually yes then i'll

00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:50,720
take a leave thanks everybody

00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:58,720
thank you uh

00:49:54,640 --> 00:50:01,119
i would say maybe it's 17

00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,079
to meet again it's not that much time i

00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:04,640
know but

00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:06,319
we have a lot of points to get how about

00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,599
we take five so we'll give five minutes

00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,400
for everyone to do whatever they got to

00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:12,079
do

00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:15,520
um so five after the hour

00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:17,520
does that sound good how many

00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,920
people are present right now like one

00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:22,720
two three i'm hoping just to do it

00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,319
and there are people on the chat as well

00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,359
yeah there's there were we earlier we

00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:28,559
had 15 people

00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:30,960
now we have nine people it looks like um

00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,599
i'm gonna go ahead and jump just for a

00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,200
little bit

00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:36,160
we'll be back in five minutes and then

00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:40,160
we'll work with the rest of the agenda

00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:42,920
okay okay yeah

00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:45,920
jonah i think we kind of over you know

00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,920
overestimated

00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:54,079
time management was bad i thought you

00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:56,880
would go like this

00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,720
it's fine i think uh regina said i like

00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,319
to have information before the next

00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:03,359
meeting

00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:06,880
uh about the collaboration

00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:10,640
or the date regina i think you can

00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:15,280
come you can come on this you can ask

00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:18,319

00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:22,079
okay yeah we can have

00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:25,280
even a call maybe next week so

00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,280

00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:42,079
what we can do after we finish when

00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:44,480
everyone comes back and we get

00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:47,200
back to the agenda if we don't finish

00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:52,160
all the things we can have a call for

00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:52,160
with the people that want to help um

00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,520
yeah like just going back to the agenda

00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,960
list

00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:03,760
if you go to uh the first point in

00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,359
sorry the f sub point improve feedback

00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,240
form

00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:09,599
i think we can do that later yeah you

00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:13,839
will just put that in a ticket

00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,839
and then discuss it there yeah

00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:19,359
and the second we kind of discussed

00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,720
about it so maybe we can get to the

00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:24,400
third point

00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:27,760
yep answer hello everyone

00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,760
hello hello

00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,000
so i'm partially still at the core s1

00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:36,319
so i'm gonna be here for the time now my

00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:40,880
demonstration is done there

00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:44,160
so i'm going for a state center

00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:46,880
uh jonah what about point three

00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:48,160
metrics generation for the event yes we

00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,160
will speak about this

00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,400
uh we can wait also for justin to come

00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:54,400
back because we can mention

00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,160
uh because this topic was discussed

00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,160
yesterday at the come up session

00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,760
yeah yeah i saw that okay yeah i'm just

00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,000
like sorting out whatever needs to be

00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,559
done

00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,640
right now yeah i think this one is just

00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,319
a bit because they already spoke about

00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,880
it yesterday

00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:12,319
okay and what about this fourth

00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,319
organizers resource pack

00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:19,680
um

00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:22,880
we can i'm not sure if it's here but

00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:25,839
uh the document that justin

00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:28,319
also had i think we can go through that

00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:31,280
i will add the link there because i

00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:33,680
forgot that we had this

00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:36,319
i think we should go to 0.6 what do you

00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:39,839
think about that

00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:43,200
1.6 yet ah yes yes

00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:43,200
because we're ready

00:53:52,960 --> 00:54:00,640
um 0.6

00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:04,960
yes so happen as a tool

00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:08,319
yes um

00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,839
so for swag delivery this is something

00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:12,800
that

00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:16,720
is definitely tough right now

00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:19,200
i have put together

00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,640
i've hatched a plan and i've gathered

00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:24,000
all the swag

00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:26,480
to do a swag bag for nest

00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,800
so i guess i can report back on how it

00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,800
goes

00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:34,000
but the problem is shipping things from

00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,480
one country to a different country

00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,640
there's just a lot going on right now

00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:42,319
for that

00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:44,640
um i think maybe we could do

00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:45,359
so i'm looking down another avenue with

00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,359
swag

00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:48,799
with ospo in general because this is

00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:51,119
something that

00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:52,240
multiple community managers are coming

00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,119
up against

00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,760
so we're trying to think of a process

00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:59,680
that

00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:01,760
will be um

00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,960
a little bit easier on everyone oh my

00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:07,119
god it's a dog

00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:09,119
hi dog um so a little bit easier on us

00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:11,119
as community managers not having to

00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:12,559
manage all the requests

00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:15,200
and then a little bit easier because

00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:18,079
we've been asking our fulfillment team

00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:19,200
to help us with this but they'll you

00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:20,880
know this is like a new

00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,760
you know it would be a totally kind of

00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:25,440
new responsibility for them to take on

00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,920
and they're not necessarily

00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,880
having that capacity so something we've

00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,960
used in the past

00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:34,960
and something we use at red hat is

00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:37,520
something called the cool stuff store

00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,240
so basically me with the cool stuff

00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,760
store

00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,079
it could work that they would do the

00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:48,559
shipping for us and we could give people

00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:52,559
credits for the cool stuff store

00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:54,400
okay so i do like virtual handovers

00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:56,480
that's an awesome idea too we should put

00:55:54,400 --> 00:56:03,040
that in the dock

00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:06,559
um virtual

00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:09,280
um so

00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:12,240
i don't know the process for the cool

00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:14,720
stuff store has not been

00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,319
finalized like most things it will take

00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:20,000
some time to get it

00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:22,480
going um write credits

00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,760
at the red hat summit right so we could

00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,440
do something like that where we're

00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,119
giving people credits and then someone

00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,359
else is dealing with

00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:31,280
the shipping and the you know all of

00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:34,799
that stuff and then

00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:38,079
we just pay the costs for that right

00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:38,720
yeah so that is an idea that's in the

00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,440
pipeline

00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:43,119
don't know if it'll be ready for through

00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:46,960
our women's day but if it was

00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:46,960
this would be a good option for us

00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:54,319
okay so like a question that jonah and i

00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:57,359
had was that would we be

00:56:54,319 --> 00:57:00,000
doing swats for only the organizers or

00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:02,720
for the participants that will come to

00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,480
the local organizer events

00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:11,359
um because usually previously we had

00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:13,760
around 100 dollars per event

00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:17,520
the budget that we used to calculate did

00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,520
we send them swag as well or no

00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,160
but usually it was we just send it some

00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:26,880
stickers span

00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:28,640
like the usual smile right um

00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,119
well i honestly don't think that people

00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:33,680
are going to need much of a

00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:36,000
budget so like for example if we did the

00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:39,040
three-day fedora women's day event

00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:42,559
and then um

00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:45,520
we got the registrant emails

00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:46,799
uh from the registrations we would send

00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:49,839
them like a one-time

00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:52,319
link or like uh here's your credit

00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:53,040
and then um you know like everyone could

00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:55,760
have

00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:58,400
you know be have enough to get like a

00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,640
sticker and a bag or something like that

00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,640
right

00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:09,839
yeah hold on

00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:13,520
yes well the thing about the cool stuff

00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:15,359
store is that they will

00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,960
like we can either give them designs and

00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:19,359
tell them what to be printing and

00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:22,400
selling to people

00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:22,400
or they can take

00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,799
merchandise on consignment so stuff that

00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:30,079
we already have

00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:31,599
we can give to them and then

00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,200
i mean that's a bunch of paperwork and

00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:36,319
stuff for me to deal with

00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:38,240
um not you guys but like that's kind of

00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:39,040
how that would work so whatever we had

00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,440
we could

00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,079
put up there and that would kind of

00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,880
solve

00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:44,880
some problems

00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:51,839
um we used to have a design for

00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:54,480
fedora women's day i think we had it for

00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:55,280
t-shirts but we never managed to print

00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,240
it

00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:59,119
so maybe we can use that design for so

00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:01,200
the one thing

00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:04,240
to think about with t-shirts is that

00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:07,440
they are a bit bulkier

00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:09,520
and we would definitely so okay another

00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,960
point about cool stuff store

00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:14,160
we would tell we would give them a

00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:16,559
design and say print this many of them

00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:18,559
we have to buy that merchandise back if

00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:20,000
it doesn't get sold so either way we're

00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:21,680
buying it

00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,359
when you're thinking about it's not

00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:26,240
something that's print on demand

00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:27,839
per item right so if we're buying all

00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:30,480
that we have to actually

00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:31,359
come up with like how many extra large

00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,000
shirts or

00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:34,880
double xl or do we want women's cut do

00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,799
we not

00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,920
so that's one of the reasons why i've

00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:41,280
avoided

00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,799
t-shirts for nests

00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,839
actually you guys want to see what i got

00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:48,160
printed

00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:50,880
oh what about virtual handovers

00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:52,240
alexandra was talking about actually i'm

00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:55,680
very curious now

00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,160
what mary will show us uh justin it was

00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:59,359
kind of

00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:02,160
a slower i think

00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:04,400
that the design i don't remember who

01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:06,559
exactly

01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,760
so i guess my point was i don't think

01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:11,760
that

01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:13,440
t-shirts are a good idea

01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,599
for for the way that we're doing

01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,920
shipping and stuff like that right now

01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:19,359
so this is the it doesn't have this

01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:22,960
print on it but i

01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:25,200
printed a bag like this for nest

01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:27,119
and it has the nest logo and then on the

01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:29,520
other side it just says best

01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:31,520
so i mean this is something that anyone

01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:33,599
can find useful to put

01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,119
i mean we can find different stuff like

01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:37,839
this

01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:38,240
that's not as bulky as a t-shirt and

01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:41,599
also

01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:42,079
doesn't have the same one-size-fits-all

01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,480
kind of

01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:46,400
thing right i'd say we could do

01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,160
something like a scarf

01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:50,559
that could be cute definitely because i

01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:52,720
think like uh people already have a lot

01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:54,960
of t-shirts because of conferences so

01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:58,000
maybe we can try to see what

01:00:54,960 --> 01:01:00,480
something else we can do

01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,720
but i i'm not sure i don't remember the

01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:05,599
exact design where it is i will try to

01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,599
find it later

01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:13,520
if we can use it

01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:15,359
for virtual handovers uh what did we

01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,280
what kind of stuff what kind of ideas

01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:19,200
did we have

01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,559
i mean alexandra pointed out about

01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:24,400
t-shirts printing

01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:26,480
t-shirts patterns for themselves

01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:30,079
print yourself a thing so basically we

01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:30,079
could give like designs away

01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:35,280
and this might be a tangent but i

01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:38,480
remember in the ambassador world

01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:40,319
bro time we had um like a page at least

01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:42,400
for north america with all the

01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:44,799
shippers that we would have worked with

01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:48,240
to do great deals for fedora stuff

01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:49,680
um that could be also a way for folks to

01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,960
kind of work together with us like i

01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:52,000
think it was one of the really unique

01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,799
decentralized

01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,079
kind of things that we've had in fedora

01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:57,680
i don't know i just always think about

01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:59,039
that would be one way of like working

01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:03,280
with local partners

01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:06,559
in those places um regional partners

01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:11,039
to help facilitate bulk build

01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:15,119
order reduct price reductions and yeah

01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:18,640
right so something that we're doing like

01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:21,119
so for nests for example i like have all

01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:23,760
the stuff being sent to raleigh

01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:25,760
and you know we'll figure out how many

01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,720
of the swag bags need to be sent for the

01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,359
folks in the us

01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:30,240
versus this region versus that region

01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:33,680
and they're going to be

01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:35,920
bulk sent from our fulfillment center

01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:37,839
to those other places for example we'll

01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:40,160
send a bunch of stuff to berno

01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:42,640
office and they'll deal with the

01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:45,280
shipping in the european area

01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:47,839
right right now it is a little bit more

01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:48,799
difficult to get things into india

01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:52,480
that's just

01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:55,920
a fact of how things are right now so

01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:58,480
we we would like to do the same thing

01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:01,119
with uh sending stuff to the pune or

01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:04,319
bangalore office whichever one has more

01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:06,640
um capacity to help with that

01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:09,280
so and then there's the one-off kind of

01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:11,280
thing alexandra what did you have to say

01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,480
i just wanted to comment on that

01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:16,240
particular issue with

01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:18,640
uh designers saying that

01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:19,680
they cannot share designs because they

01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,760
will look

01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:23,520
different on different printers so it's

01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:26,720
totally impossible

01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:31,359
i think uh we had this conversation like

01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:34,559
five fours six years ago and i think

01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:36,079
i would like redo this conversation

01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:36,799
again because i think it's a wrong

01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:40,480
attitude

01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:41,039
on to to these things so people who want

01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:44,400
swag

01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:47,599
they they don't need 100

01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:50,400
ideal pantone compatible uh thing

01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:52,480
which will be like absolutely identical

01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:56,079
to what original designer thought

01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:57,599
they they want some swag for fun and and

01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:59,440
when designers block the whole

01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:02,640
initiative we really

01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:05,359
like not helping when after

01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:08,160
that conversation what i did personally

01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:10,240
i just went to fedora vicky took the svg

01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:12,319
with fedora splash image and went to my

01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:14,799
local store and printed the t-shirt

01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:16,160
and it definitely it wasn't the exact

01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:18,720
feed or a color that

01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:19,599
designer wanted but it was blue on white

01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:22,160
on

01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:22,640
black and it was awesome t-shirt it was

01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,680
like

01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:26,000
i used it for two years on every event i

01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:29,680
went

01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:32,319
so i'm totally like glad that i made it

01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:34,240
but i did it against the design fedora

01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:35,720
designer team because we said oh no it's

01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:38,640
not going to be this

01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:41,280
cmyk we don't know where he printed like

01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:42,400
i don't care i just need you know a

01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,559
certain

01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,520
simple enough design to share yeah

01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:47,680
that's just a

01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:49,520
comment from previous experience i

01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,160
appreciate that comment alexandra

01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:52,400
because

01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:54,319
i think that because the resources are

01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:58,160
available and we have

01:04:54,319 --> 01:05:00,079
people who are um crafty or

01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:02,079
like thinking thoughtfully enough to

01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:04,079
kind of just do things on their own

01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:05,599
fine i'm not gonna go down and hunt

01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:07,119
those people down be like what are you

01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:09,280
doing with the trademark

01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:11,680
but what i don't propose is that we

01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:14,799
promote that

01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:17,520
what i i propose is that we promote

01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:18,799
um like okay so you want to get swag

01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:21,839
sent to your

01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:23,599
uh your instead of getting a sense of

01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:24,960
fulfillment center i still want to pay

01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:26,799
for that for you

01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,000
i still would like to get it printed

01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:31,039
properly

01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,960
so instead of you taking the file i put

01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:35,200
the order in online and i have it

01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:37,599
shipped directly to you

01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,720
i mean that's that's another version

01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:41,599
another

01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:42,960
uh way that gets the swag into the hands

01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:46,160
of the contributor

01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:49,920
and then for people who are um

01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:50,799
kind of uh what's the word crafty enough

01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:54,000
to

01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:56,799
know their capabilities uh they

01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,119
don't understand i understand your point

01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:59,280
but

01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:01,039
it feels for me that we're like losing a

01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:04,160
lot of fun stuff we could make

01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:07,920
like like imagine people doing their

01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:10,720
fun drawings uh like a lot of trademarks

01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:12,400
trademark stuff it's it's like a purdy

01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,520
stuff or i don't know there should be a

01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:16,480
name for this

01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:16,799
so if i'm doing bracelet uh and i add

01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:20,079
some

01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:21,280
fedora logo on it like should i ask you

01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:23,359
to do this for me

01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:25,520
or is it my stuff which i'm going like i

01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:28,400
don't have it right now yet but uh like

01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:29,119
if if i do such a thing sitting at home

01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,880
doing

01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:37,119
nothing else but so we need a certain

01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:39,839
level of like i'm what if we for example

01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:40,400
make it easier to approve we design uh

01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:43,200
and say

01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,920
i want to this picture i okay with this

01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,480
and and

01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:48,640
i go but i don't want to wait for you to

01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,480
order for me the thing which i may be

01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:54,400
just making it this is a great

01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:56,480
conversation for the design team

01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,920
um so i just don't want to get this

01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:01,119
conversation too far

01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:04,000
off track um for the

01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:04,559
fedora women's day i think it's that the

01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,839
issue

01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:10,319
of people feeling like they can't get

01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:11,920
designs for what they need is a valid

01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:14,480
one

01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:16,000
and i think it's definitely a good

01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:20,000
conversation to have

01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:23,599
there is a irc that you could go there's

01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:27,039
a ticket repo but so as far as it

01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:29,200
uh relates to fedora women's day

01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:30,640
i think that we have some really cool

01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:33,839
graphics already

01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:37,599
for fedora women's group and we can

01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:39,760
elaborate off of those um

01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,880
to create some resources now i'm not

01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,920
sure where

01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:46,640
exactly you're talking about virtual

01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:50,559
handovers right

01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:52,559
um so we could do something cool like we

01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:55,200
could release something

01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:56,480
uh at the fedora women's day like a set

01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:58,720
of

01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:00,000
stickers for telegram you know you can

01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:03,119
make your own sticker

01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:05,359
telegram sticker pack yeah

01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:06,160
people who have done uh a few already

01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:08,960
with fedora

01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:10,400
so right so we can do something like

01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:13,680
that like this is the

01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:15,039
cool thing that's coming out for fedora

01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:17,520
women's day

01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:19,199
and it could be like some stylized

01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:23,839
diverse set of ladies

01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:27,040
you know emoting different things right

01:08:23,839 --> 01:08:28,080
just one idea of something cool that

01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:30,880
people might find

01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:34,080
interactive and keep them thinking about

01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:37,759
the event long after it's happened

01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:40,480
um anyway does anyone else have things

01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:40,480
i've been talking

01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:46,960
yeah i know i don't have any ideas

01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:50,159
new ideas now but i think we can

01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:52,159
check it later again like

01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:54,080
yeah maybe for the short term we can try

01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:56,719
it we can check back in after nest

01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:57,440
on how the shipment swag shipments go on

01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:00,560
that yeah

01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:03,679
and we can just fault right

01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:05,759
i just have another idea ashlyn has an

01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:06,319
idea of facebook profile cover images

01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:08,239
which

01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:10,319
sounds cool another one i was thinking

01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:11,920
of was

01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:14,400
oh gosh it's just right out of my head

01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,400
hold on

01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:20,560
i'm going to just add this i'm adding it

01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:21,120
in now oh i was thinking like what about

01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:25,679
like

01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:28,880
phone wallpapers um

01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:30,960
interesting right like we could we could

01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:32,799
ask the design team to adapt some of the

01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,920
wallpapers

01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:38,080
um to phone backgrounds who would use

01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,080
that

01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:46,480
all right they're so cool

01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,679
right uh that could be a cool idea so is

01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:50,799
anybody

01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:53,839
another um thing that we could do

01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:56,480
separately i don't know

01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:58,800
what countries this is available in hold

01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,800
that one

01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:07,360
but if you're aware of redbubble

01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:11,280
yeah um

01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:14,159
is that available in europe

01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:16,640
i think yes i remember that i ordered

01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:16,640
something

01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:32,960
also i'm just going to take a second to

01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:32,960
shave mostly self-promote

01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:48,320
not sure

01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,320
trying to see if i can buy something

01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:54,800
i mean yes it it does show it's just

01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:57,600
that everything is in dollars

01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:59,199
probably if there'll be a problem with

01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,800
shipping

01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:02,239
because of the restrictions all right

01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,880
sorry about that guys all right so

01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:08,719
here's this red bubbling

01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,719
this is my shop for my artwork

01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:13,440
but um the cool thing about this is you

01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:17,120
can go in and design

01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:20,080
um different types of things so like

01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:24,840
here there's iphone cases

01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:28,239
um which posters

01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:30,159
bags so you do have to spend a little

01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:30,640
bit of time designing each item but we

01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:33,199
could just

01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:35,440
include like a couple and we can set it

01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:38,080
so that we're not making any

01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:39,600
um profit off of it and we could

01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:41,440
potentially give people credit

01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,800
to the store as well and this would be a

01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:44,719
way to do it

01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,480
on our own i just don't know the

01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:49,120
availability of this

01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,120
globally

01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:58,080
and also like we can give credits to

01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,080
people so they can

01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:03,360
uh buy it and shipping to them

01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:10,560
right so uh the idea is

01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:11,600
for us to have to do less work as far as

01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,840
shipping

01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,280
and coordination of shipping that's why

01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:17,920
we're talking about

01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:19,120
third-party you know print-on-demand

01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,600
options

01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:23,520
and swag options that are not us doing

01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,600
the shipments because it's just not as

01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:28,560
dependable right now

01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:30,159
and it's a bit more expensive but i'd

01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:32,640
rather

01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:34,320
i'd rather have some kind of option so

01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,320
with redbubble there's all kinds of

01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:38,239
products like we could do you know for

01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:41,280
fedora women's day we could have a cup

01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:44,320
and a a mask i'm sure

01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:46,880
i found some regional

01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:48,480
fabrics that can help with that so the

01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:50,960
shippings are not

01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:51,600
that far away so you have something that

01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:53,440
can

01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,120
cover south america and something that

01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:56,080
can cover central america and something

01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:59,360
that has better

01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,840
north america nation so that's kind of

01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:03,199
what i'm

01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:05,600
trying to do for nest oh it's not

01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:05,600
listening

01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:11,360
that is what i'm trying to that is what

01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,520
i'm doing for nest and i'm

01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:14,480
doing that through the oscar fulfillment

01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:18,000
team

01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:19,920
right but the thing is i i'm going to be

01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,440
the one who has to coordinate that and i

01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,080
don't want to coordinate with local

01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,560
vendors

01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:26,719
across the world what i want to do is

01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:29,679
have to coordinate with one place

01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:30,159
and that would be the cool stuff store

01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:32,400
which

01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:35,440
uh marine we talked about before you

01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:39,280
came on or something like red bubble

01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:41,040
um so i am not trying to coordinate

01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:43,120
things all over the place with different

01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:44,400
vendors and coordination but this just

01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:47,520
sounds like a nightmare

01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:49,520
so that's my people people from

01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:52,560
each community can do that that's that's

01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:55,600
how it has been done in the past

01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,920
those who are kind of interests can help

01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,840
no

01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:59,360
doesn't work i just think it's something

01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:02,400
that i would prefer

01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:04,400
to just have it set up so that

01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,080
local organizers can worry about things

01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:11,120
like content for their

01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:12,880
events versus logistics around swag

01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:14,719
i don't know am i yeah i'm just i'm just

01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:17,440
worried

01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:18,159
uh of course i'm always going to worry

01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:21,600
about

01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:24,719
south and central america so

01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:29,040
yeah it seems it seems doable for

01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:29,040
europe and uh to do

01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:38,880
do you have access to redbubble

01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:40,159
uh i'm checking here check this out uh

01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,560
yeah i'm just checking if they have

01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:46,640
something local

01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:49,120
but there's a link you can try yeah

01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:50,400
yeah i think i joined in the product

01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:53,520
moment

01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:57,440
light but in the process uh

01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:57,440
yeah i just put a link in the chat

01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:01,280
if you're able to order from that or not

01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:04,400
yeah

01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:07,840
i'm just at least it shows an idea that

01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,840
you can currency

01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:12,080
maybe it will not be a problem because

01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:13,520
uh i can order because i have an

01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:15,600
american account

01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,600
so

01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:22,560
the thing is shipping okay so justin

01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,560
what were you gonna say

01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:27,199
um i was just going to say maybe we

01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,719
could just so we can get through some of

01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:30,560
the other parts of the agenda because

01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:32,080
we're still going to talk about metrics

01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,760
and i also want to make sure we talk a

01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:35,520
little bit about what funding looks like

01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:38,080
for organizers this year

01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:40,080
um i think we should come back to this

01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:41,199
topic once we have feedback from how

01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:44,239
nest goes

01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:46,159
but maybe a path forward will be as far

01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:47,600
as the centralization of swag i think

01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:50,719
there's a point

01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,719
maybe some unique

01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:55,440
the budget really does have to do yeah

01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,320
the budget does have to do with the swag

01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,239
though

01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:00,320
because we're looking now at shipping

01:15:58,239 --> 01:16:02,080
costs like

01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:03,840
different kinds of shipping costs that

01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:05,679
we were before i think

01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:07,520
i think that was what alexandra's idea

01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:10,400
was about the virtual handovers

01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:12,080
is i think that idea of the central

01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,280
production of swag which might will

01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,880
probably work really well for north

01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:18,159
america and the mia

01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:20,159
is is fine but we might want to be

01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:22,000
open-minded in some cases that some

01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:24,239
local organizers are going to be able to

01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,080
work faster and quicker and still follow

01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:27,920
best practices for design by working

01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:30,080
with local partners so you

01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,280
put that shipping and logistics piece

01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,960
but we'll just have to

01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:35,120
there would be a paperwork piece there

01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:38,640
but i think it would be something that

01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:40,480
if it makes sense for most people who

01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:42,400
are proposing events and i think it's

01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:44,080
just a good way that we can keep it open

01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:45,679
as an option in the cases where that

01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:48,159
might actually

01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:50,320
be the better or more easier option for

01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:52,800
the local organizer

01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:54,000
right i don't want to import too often i

01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:57,040
think there's ways we can

01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:59,120
no i totally agree i think it's going to

01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:00,400
just provide a little bit of limitation

01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:03,679
as far as

01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:05,199
what they can do because uh and that's

01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:07,679
fine it's better than nothing

01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:09,360
and what i mean by that is they're not

01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:10,400
going to be able to print five different

01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:12,400
stickers

01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:14,000
30 a piece because that's going to cost

01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:17,600
a lot you know they have to be able to

01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:19,280
print one sticker a hundred of them

01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:21,280
for however much so there's just there's

01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:23,679
gonna be less options

01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:24,719
but i say we should be able to provide

01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:26,719
that

01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:29,199
support if people wanna do it and need

01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:29,199
to do it

01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:33,120
i think if we're transparent about it

01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,520
and people know

01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:37,040
then that's perfect okay i'm gonna

01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:39,199
refresh really quick because the

01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:42,000
chat crashed for me and it says i have

01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:42,000
to refresh so

01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:48,400
okay

01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:52,480
for the point number three then yes

01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:52,480
but we need justin back because

01:17:54,480 --> 01:18:00,320
that's funny or b

01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,320
maybe b

01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:07,920
i'm still here yeah just listening to

01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:10,960
all that discussion

01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:14,159
the third point is about the metrics and

01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:16,159
it was something that you

01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:18,719
were speaking yesterday at the come up

01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:21,840
session so maybe you can

01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:25,120
share also more when it was discussed uh

01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:27,600
yes so basically uh

01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:28,159
we want in common discussing that it

01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:32,400
would be

01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:34,400
nice to have some dni related metrics

01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,679
so we were thinking like one thing which

01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:38,239
we could do right

01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:38,719
immediately was that we could just uh

01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:41,440
plot

01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:41,840
all the different like fedora women's

01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:45,360
day

01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:48,560
events uh which took place over like the

01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:50,960
a map of all the globe but like in the

01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:52,640
future we also want like not just this

01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:55,120
information like how many

01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:57,920
organizers where from which country or

01:18:55,120 --> 01:19:00,640
which location but also like

01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,360
the attendees hopefully so we were

01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:04,480
thinking that

01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:09,840
if we have one platform like hopping

01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:09,840
we can just

01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,520
that we will have some uh email ids of

01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,640
all the

01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:17,120
attendees so we can either send them a

01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:19,360
link

01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:21,600
to create like a fast account and get

01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:23,760
like a women's day badge

01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,719
or like still keep in touch with them

01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,440
after

01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:29,600
or you can just create some like fun

01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:32,719
pause like we did now for nest

01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:35,120
in the uh hop in uh

01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:37,040
site and then like have some quick

01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:38,159
metrics like how many are comfortable

01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:40,640
with english or

01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:42,880
how many need like some different

01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:44,719
language and events or like what even

01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:47,440
what talk they enjoyed the most so we

01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:49,840
can get a better idea of what area

01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:52,239
and that and these are looking for and

01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:52,239
so on

01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:58,960
so i think the poll function can happen

01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:58,960
is really fun for us

01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:04,000
um the one thing about it is i shouldn't

01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,600
maybe shouldn't

01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,920
tell a whole room of people this but

01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:10,080
like you can go to a different browser

01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:12,480
and double vote

01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:14,480
or like refresh your bro like you can

01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:17,600
find out ways to double vote

01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:19,440
so like is it entirely accurate no but

01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:22,000
it gives us a good sense

01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:23,679
i do like the fact that it's like

01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:27,360
completely anonymous like

01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:29,120
i yeah um so

01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:30,880
what i what did i want to show you oh i

01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:33,440
wanted to show you guys just the back

01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:37,679
end of this for like a second

01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:37,679
you guys want to see that um

01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,040
so like here's some of the stuff like

01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:47,679
you can actually see

01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:49,920
we didn't charge anybody 490

01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:54,159
registrations

01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:54,159
you can see registrations by country

01:20:55,199 --> 01:21:00,080
and visitors by country

01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:02,400
which is cool but you can also see that

01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:05,440
people are using vpns and

01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:05,440
various other things

01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:12,840
um you can see what

01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:14,560
people are using what device operating

01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:17,920
system

01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:21,280
um so that's interesting and then

01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:26,840
there's i think there's some

01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:29,679
more stuff over here

01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:31,520
curious so you have like a poll

01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:32,080
submarine in the back and it actually

01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:34,080
sent me an

01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:35,840
email with the poll summary from

01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:41,040
yesterday

01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:41,040
so you have that back there too um

01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:48,000
so this is kind of you have stage

01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:51,920
summary so it gives you all your videos

01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:54,320
um you can email attendees

01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:56,719
through here i have just chosen not to

01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:58,400
do do that besides the standard ones

01:21:56,719 --> 01:22:01,520
they send

01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:03,760
um you can

01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:05,840
do all kinds of stuff with this so i

01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:07,920
guess my point is

01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:11,440
we should be able to fulfill a lot of

01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:15,280
the ideas that you guys have

01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:18,639
with some of these tools and

01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:20,400
um another thing you know we're talking

01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:22,719
about

01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:24,960
surveys in general or just for with

01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:27,040
regards to fedora women's day or metrics

01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,560
in general or just in regards to fedora

01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:31,520
women's day

01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:32,960
wednesday so i have one question i'm not

01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,719
sure if we discuss

01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:36,320
this i know we were discussing this

01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:37,360
before but i'm not sure if we reached a

01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:40,400
conclusion

01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:42,800
so will we use like one hop-in uh

01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:45,440
instance for all the events or different

01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,440
different ones

01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:52,239
but it depends on the organizers in case

01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:56,480
they want to use another tool

01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:57,199
which also reminds me that we need to

01:22:56,480 --> 01:23:00,639
make sure

01:22:57,199 --> 01:23:04,159
that the the metrics that we want to get

01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:07,360
we should ask the organizers to get

01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:09,060
from the other platform here

01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:11,040
i don't know if they will use uh

01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:13,520
[Music]

01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:15,199
google hangouts or whatever other tool

01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:16,000
we should know like how many people they

01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:18,800
will have

01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,719
countries some kind of metrics yeah they

01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:23,360
should use something for like event

01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:26,880
registration so to have like just

01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:28,880
who like some kind of free registration

01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:31,980
even though the ticket is free

01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:33,280
like so we have at least many of them

01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:36,480
[Applause]

01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:38,320
or something to contact them after

01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:40,639
because we had this problem

01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:41,520
that we need uh some way to contact the

01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:45,520
attendees

01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:45,520
after the event as well and to keep in

01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:49,840
touch

01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:58,159
strategy for federal women's day going

01:23:56,400 --> 01:24:00,159
virtual this year like maybe would help

01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:02,320
if we focus like what are the one or two

01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:06,080
things we want to learn from

01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:09,120
fedora women's day 2020 and we can try

01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:11,120
to some extent to build around that um

01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:14,159
at least in terms of what metrics we can

01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:15,600
build or collect

01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:17,440
there might be a place to start like by

01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,440
a fedora badge would be a good

01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:20,719
place to start for attendees and maybe

01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:22,239
organizers too

01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:24,400
um because that was one thing that came

01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:24,880
up this year was like who who organized

01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:27,120
them in

01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:28,080
2017 in 2018 and we were trying to dig

01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:30,800
to find all that

01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,800
so they'll be doing

01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:41,360
i'm not against it we've tried to shy

01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:43,120
away from doing like organizer and

01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:46,639
speaker badges for something

01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:49,679
but i think you know it

01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:51,520
does give incentive for people it does

01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:59,840
give them something to validate that

01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:59,840
yeah i'm down for that um

01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:08,159
oh i was just saying cathy but i saw

01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,719
your message there in the chat and yeah

01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:13,440
that's

01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:16,239
too expensive so

01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:16,239
the problem with

01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:19,920
the problem with that is then who is

01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:22,560
doing so like

01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:23,840
practica if you went and got those ships

01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:26,560
or got those printed

01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,760
then you would have whatever 500 of them

01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,199
or something

01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:32,159
then what would you do with them you

01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:35,840
would ship them individually

01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:35,840
what i have been doing for the past 15

01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:42,880
years

01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:43,760
usually working in latin america which

01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:45,760
is that i

01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:48,159
had to take my maternity leave and lots

01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:48,560
of stuff but that was how we usually did

01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:51,760
it here

01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:54,159
right educate me i don't know well

01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:56,560
the usual thing in latin america was

01:25:54,159 --> 01:26:00,239
that i went to a conference

01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:02,320
got my suitcase full of goodies and swag

01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:03,679
and then i locally distributed two

01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:06,639
different houses

01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:09,040
so it was the same person from america

01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:09,040
but

01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:23,840
argentina

01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:39,360
being a mom now that i'm not going to

01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:42,480
international

01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:43,440
for me shipping is way easier i actually

01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,760
just did a

01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:47,199
really small walk by the new

01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:50,800
neighborhood that i am

01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:53,040
and i have a dhl and a local ship in a

01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:53,600
post office and i have several things i

01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:56,960
was

01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:58,880
i didn't have back at home so

01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:00,560
having those international shippings is

01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:03,679
good also

01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:05,920
my local north american career

01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:06,800
within this city and they usually take

01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:09,840
only one week

01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:13,040
from miami to to put

01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:15,280
the goodies in here in my house so

01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:16,080
things have changed drastically for me

01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:19,120
in the past

01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:21,120
10 days and i hope that this kind of

01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:23,520
changes also helped me to

01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:24,639
uh not just to produce locally because

01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:27,440
here the prices are

01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:29,600
really great uh the one that i show you

01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:33,840
is my kids one

01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:36,239
but this was less than two dollars

01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:37,679
uh and then i could use the rest of the

01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:40,560
money which is going to be less

01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:41,760
to this everyday i'm not thinking on

01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:44,000
huge books

01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,880
because currently we know that we have

01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,719
to

01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:50,639
uh grow latin america again there was a

01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:51,440
huge burnout and all that that's another

01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:54,400
topic

01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:55,679
but we can start as we started you know

01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:59,360
10 years ago

01:27:55,679 --> 01:28:01,360
small packages i can contact uh

01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:03,199
different countries vendors so i can

01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:07,199
make sure that they do the things like

01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:09,600
like we should do the things so

01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:10,880
joining that with the with the surveys

01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:12,719
and all of that

01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:14,560
i mean the more information we have then

01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:18,159
the better packages we can build

01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:21,840
either physical or digital

01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:21,840
so yeah and i think actually

01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:26,239
no for example in the czech republic i

01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:29,520
know

01:28:26,239 --> 01:28:32,639
because i speak with dorca on some

01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:34,960
frequency that like for them

01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:36,639
uh printing and shipping locally is like

01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:39,440
way cheaper

01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:39,840
than doing some kind of online service

01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:42,480
so

01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:43,679
i think this country particularly in

01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:45,679
colombia

01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:47,280
is uh when you talk about prices it's

01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:49,840
like in china

01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:50,400
for europe so this is probably the

01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:52,400
cheapest

01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:54,400
country because they're just in the

01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:56,960
middle of the continent

01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:57,600
so it's easier to ship to central

01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:02,239
america

01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:02,239
and to southern so that's an advantage

01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:06,400
but again we don't have to cover that

01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:06,960
topic because that's what i want to pop

01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:11,760
it on the

01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:13,760
1pm right

01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,600
the idea there and there is the option

01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:18,719
for the latin american guys

01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:21,840
who is a really different uh

01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:26,320
you know issue yeah yeah i mean

01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:30,000
uh for me it's just a matter of

01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:30,400
yeah like time versus like effort versus

01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,159
like

01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:34,080
if you're willing to head that up that

01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:37,360
seems great right

01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:39,520
um i think it's just a local

01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:41,280
person by person situation that we're

01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:43,040
gonna have to handle

01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:44,560
but if we're if we're like bringing the

01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:48,080
conversation back

01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:49,520
around to budget and how that has to do

01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:52,719
with swag

01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:53,920
i think this is pretty tough to

01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:55,600
understand

01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:57,600
all of the costs that might go into

01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:59,360
something like you know swag is probably

01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:03,520
one of the biggest

01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:06,800
um points of the budget

01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:08,800
for online virtual events or

01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:11,360
it would go towards something like doing

01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:12,560
a virtual activity online like a game or

01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:14,400
something like that

01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:17,760
some of them do cost just a little bit

01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:21,199
of money actually

01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:24,560
okay so first you need to you need to

01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:26,719
uh i mean it's not

01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:28,800
the way that we used to do that is that

01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:32,080
what are we talking about

01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:34,960
oh the virtual packages and the physical

01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:34,960
packages didn't you

01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:41,440
i'm just talking about a budget

01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,420
and then i was thinking we should just

01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:45,120
go with the same dollar amount

01:30:43,420 --> 01:30:48,560
[Music]

01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:51,760
100 budget and see

01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:55,280
how that does i mean if we if we get

01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:57,199
say we get 12 um

01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:59,360
you know different fedora women's day

01:30:57,199 --> 01:31:02,000
signing up for that event

01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:03,760
then we have 1200 to work with which is

01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:07,440
pretty good

01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:10,960
that would probably be too much but yeah

01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:14,239
i mean uh i spent

01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:17,679
twelve dollars to make 10

01:31:14,239 --> 01:31:19,920
10 mass covers so

01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:21,280
maybe we can start doing small packages

01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:23,840
for the organizers

01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:24,480
of this uh women event even if they are

01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:27,040
held

01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:28,159
virtually and something that is small

01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:31,360
and can be shipped through

01:31:28,159 --> 01:31:33,600
regular posts and if we send that

01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:35,600
three or four weeks prior because there

01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:37,760
is no need to send that you know

01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:39,440
two or three days before then they can

01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:40,320
have it for the very full contract as

01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:43,440
well

01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:44,239
so as far as hop in costs there is a

01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:46,480
cost

01:31:44,239 --> 01:31:48,639
a lot like a larger dollar amount that

01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:51,920
will go on to the flock

01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:55,440
budget but then as we continue there are

01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:57,360
uh for each event there i'm pretty sure

01:31:55,440 --> 01:32:01,920
there are registration fees

01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:01,920
but i believe that the um

01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:07,840
sorry the program that we went with or

01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:10,159
the deal package we went with it was

01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:13,600
like a dollar per registration

01:32:10,159 --> 01:32:15,360
and then every admin you join like do on

01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:19,440
top it's another 10 cents

01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:19,440
per registration so

01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:23,600
i'm i like i said i'm not sure about how

01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,960
many admin slots

01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:27,520
i'm not the one in control of all of the

01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:29,120
negotiations

01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:31,840
there are people to be considered that

01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:34,400
have different needs than our community

01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:35,120
so we're getting it for a bit cheaper

01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:38,320
but we are

01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:39,600
sharing the service right so those are

01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:43,280
the kinds of things we have to keep in

01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:46,480
account i don't think it's going to be

01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:48,159
very costly like say we have 300

01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:49,840
registrants

01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:51,920
i think we're looking at like three to

01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:55,840
four hundred dollars

01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:55,840
for hopping

01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:02,000
i i hope not and honestly i think that

01:33:00,159 --> 01:33:05,440
for like the hop-in

01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:08,960
accounts well we'll see how it works out

01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:10,960
i actually have

01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:12,239
this is a bigger conversation that's now

01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,760
playing out in my brain

01:33:12,239 --> 01:33:15,679
that none of you need to be a part of

01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:17,199
but it has to do with that

01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:18,960
we can forget about that in the

01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:21,440
afternoons of the world yeah

01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:22,239
that's just a bit of metrics and what

01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:25,520
what

01:33:22,239 --> 01:33:28,080
can we do to inspire more

01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:29,199
female to not just join the conference

01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:32,800
but contribute

01:33:29,199 --> 01:33:32,800
i think that will be the main point here

01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:37,600
for me the main reason to be into the

01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:41,239
fedora woman

01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:43,840
group is one to kind of feel

01:33:41,239 --> 01:33:45,120
understand understood understand

01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:48,000
something like that

01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:49,840
because i'm a mom and usually uh not

01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,840
everyone but is

01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:54,000
it's a reality that when my kid jumps on

01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:56,080
top of me everybody's like oh

01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,280
she's not gonna talk but that happens

01:33:56,080 --> 01:34:02,000
it's like

01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:02,000
uh the other thing is uh

01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:07,280
we have different uh

01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:08,639
schedules that we have to meet us with

01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:12,719
females

01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:12,719
especially the ones that are our moms

01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:19,840
should be too

01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:33,199
and also to seek inspiration because

01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:35,120
if we see women that can cope with a

01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:36,639
university because i know that jonah

01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:39,360
isn't too that cheap

01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:42,880
uh because work can come with family

01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:46,480
either if it's just relatives or

01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:50,560
partners kids pets because we have

01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:53,600
kids too uh and we actually thrive on it

01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:55,440
i think that's way more interesting than

01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,880
than having a technical conference for

01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,520
me because the technical conference can

01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:00,320
come from

01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:01,119
different sizes it's more about how a

01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:03,119
female

01:35:01,119 --> 01:35:05,119
can you grow into the technical world

01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:06,880
and still be a female

01:35:05,119 --> 01:35:08,239
now be considered hey i thought you were

01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:09,840
a guy

01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:12,880
you usually get when you're in a chat

01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:16,239
with your face on

01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:19,040
so something that would be cool for

01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:20,719
me some piece of information that would

01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:25,199
be interesting for me to have

01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:28,239
it's like what can fedora do better

01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:29,840
what can open source communities do

01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:33,360
better

01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:35,760
uh to be more inclusive

01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:36,639
towards women so i don't know if we're

01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:40,560
talking about like an

01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:42,560
open feedback session or

01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:45,119
some different polls like we come up

01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:46,239
with a variety of polls on that topic

01:35:45,119 --> 01:35:49,600
and we put them through

01:35:46,239 --> 01:35:51,199
in the chat and you know

01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:52,639
get some feedback on something like what

01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:54,239
could we do what can we do better in

01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:56,159
this aspect what we do better in that

01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:57,520
aspect unfortunately with that we can't

01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:59,679
do write-ins

01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:00,800
but justin i did see you know you said

01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:04,000
something in

01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:08,000
a channel and we do have an option

01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,000
for something called lime survey

01:36:08,159 --> 01:36:11,280
so lime survey is something that i've

01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:14,560
been

01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:18,239
a service that i've been looking into

01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:21,440
and have now signed up for an account on

01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:22,639
to do a couple things so one of the

01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:25,840
things is to support

01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:27,600
cpe in their community happiness

01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:30,880
initiative

01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:34,080
um and then another one

01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:34,560
is well we're using it for lightning

01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:37,679
talks

01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:39,119
hold on one sec i have

01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:41,040
something that i wanted to do for the

01:36:39,119 --> 01:36:44,239
council i think i had

01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:46,000
another use for it as well so a lime

01:36:44,239 --> 01:36:47,679
survey is definitely something we can be

01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,719
using

01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:53,360
um it isn't

01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:55,280
like it doesn't have like a front-facing

01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:58,719
interface like i can't set up

01:36:55,280 --> 01:37:00,080
a survey through our account like

01:36:58,719 --> 01:37:02,239
i don't know vehicle would have to get

01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:03,840
on and explain how it works

01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:06,480
but i'm pretty sure we have our own

01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:07,760
instance and do this and that i'm not

01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:10,080
like yeah i don't know all the

01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:11,840
information behind that but the idea

01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:16,639
there is like

01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:16,639
we can't collect identifying information

01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:23,600
so we can't collect like

01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:27,040
you know are you a woman are you

01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:29,440
you know straight gay by like

01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:31,360
or what race are you like we can't do

01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:32,400
those kinds of things but we can ask

01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:35,520
people questions

01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:37,440
about fedora women's day we can ask

01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:39,360
people questions about

01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:41,920
diversity and how they think we should

01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:41,920
do better

01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:47,440
so i think that we can still like

01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:48,719
i talked to a lawyer within red hat

01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:50,800
legal

01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:52,239
and i was like oh surveys what's the

01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:53,760
deal with surveys you know my

01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:55,440
predecessor

01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:57,360
or you know we ran up to this issue in

01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:58,719
the past and i was like do we need to

01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:00,800
like run these things by

01:37:58,719 --> 01:38:02,639
legal or whatever and she's like what if

01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:04,080
we had to look at every single survey

01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:06,480
that red hatters

01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:08,080
placed like that's all we'd be doing and

01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:09,360
i was like okay fair and i was like

01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:11,600
what's the general

01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:13,280
ground like framework of how we can do

01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:14,080
this and she's like just don't be

01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:17,840
collecting

01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:20,080
personal information so i think as long

01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:22,159
as we don't do that we won't run into a

01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:26,000
situation where someone would give us a

01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:28,400
gdpr request and then if

01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,360
in on the off chance it would happen

01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:31,440
what we would do

01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:32,880
is i would take that request to legal

01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:35,280
and i would

01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:37,840
have zipple remove it from our instance

01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:40,080
and issue the red hat standard

01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:41,119
response to them that it has been

01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:44,480
removed

01:38:41,119 --> 01:38:47,040
now i can't imagine us like

01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:48,000
since we're going about it very

01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:51,199
decisively

01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:53,760
that we would choose to collect

01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:54,719
personal data but if say we did by

01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:57,440
accident

01:38:54,719 --> 01:38:59,440
or say someone was just like i consider

01:38:57,440 --> 01:39:00,800
that personal and i want it removed

01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:02,320
we're just going to remove it we're not

01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:03,119
going to fight with them we're just

01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:05,280
going to

01:39:03,119 --> 01:39:07,520
just remove it and be fine with that all

01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:08,719
right so this is kind of red hat stance

01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:11,440
on it

01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:12,320
as from from my understanding and what i

01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:15,360
am

01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:16,719
like working on right so i did i got the

01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:19,760
wine survey account

01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:21,360
and i am the one who is like basically

01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:24,080
figuring out what's going to go on there

01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:26,239
or not and i do want to outline

01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:28,560
a separate note says i want to outline a

01:39:26,239 --> 01:39:30,320
process for other folks on how to use

01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:33,280
that

01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:34,639
outside of just dni or mindshare et

01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:36,719
cetera et cetera but

01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:38,239
i would like it to be a little bit more

01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:39,920
widely known

01:39:38,239 --> 01:39:41,760
the one thing is i don't want it to be

01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:43,760
used for

01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:45,600
just whatever so there should be some

01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:47,040
kind of standard of like

01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:49,840
you know what what can be used there

01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:52,719
anyway a point about surveys

01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:54,320
and how we can use them to figure out

01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:55,280
some of the most important things we

01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:58,480
need back

01:39:55,280 --> 01:40:01,840
or we want to know about improving

01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:02,159
uh the situation or what people think we

01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:09,840
did

01:40:02,159 --> 01:40:09,840
we're doing well already etc etc

01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:26,800
so i i what do you mean well if you

01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:29,840
have some standards for

01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:33,520
what is uh even i think

01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:33,520
it was something you were saying right

01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:40,960
buddy

01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:40,960
i i cannot hear you i think

01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:44,239
i muted myself

01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:48,080
standards for what can go on the lime

01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:51,199
survey

01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:52,880
yeah uh i just mean that was

01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:56,159
it shouldn't it's not something we're

01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:58,320
gonna give access to everyone

01:40:56,159 --> 01:41:00,159
it's something that we're going to you

01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:01,040
know it's not just like oh just randomly

01:41:00,159 --> 01:41:03,199
do like a fun

01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:05,679
little survey like viple has to go in

01:41:03,199 --> 01:41:08,480
and set it all up etc etc

01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:09,520
it's work for people so when i say

01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:11,760
standard i just mean

01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:14,080
like it's just not like a thing we're

01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:14,080
just gonna

01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:17,760
use for anyone just like any time we do

01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:18,000
with like i'm pretty sure it's going to

01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:20,480
run

01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:22,320
through my chair so the same way like

01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:24,080
people would do a swag request or any

01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:26,400
other thing we could have them

01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:27,280
submit a request to do a survey and we

01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:29,760
would work with them

01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:31,600
talk with them figure it out you know

01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:33,600
buff up the idea just like we do for

01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:35,119
other things with mindshare

01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:37,679
that's probably what the process gonna

01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:40,880
look like does that make more sense

01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:44,080
yes yeah okay

01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:45,600
b does that make more sense um yes it

01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:47,840
does can you hear

01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,840
yes

01:41:48,639 --> 01:41:54,639
um but so

01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:55,199
i'm not sure about like how we can

01:41:54,639 --> 01:41:57,520
collect

01:41:55,199 --> 01:41:59,520
like more information through these like

01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:02,639
common surveys

01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:06,639
uh like do we just ask them

01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:07,920
uh like what some feedback about

01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:10,239
different teams

01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:13,280
but then like it might be too much right

01:42:10,239 --> 01:42:16,719
if someone is just requesting a swag and

01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:19,600
i have anyone looked at the cpe survey

01:42:16,719 --> 01:42:19,600
has anyone done it

01:42:21,199 --> 01:42:24,320
do you know what i'm talking about the

01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:29,119
cpe survey

01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:32,320
no can you share the link hold on

01:42:29,119 --> 01:42:34,800
oh we are at time oh

01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,800
it's okay

01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:40,000
took something really quick that i think

01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:42,719
is really relevant to

01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,360
fedora we didn't get a chance to talk

01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:46,719
about

01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:49,760
um i was just gonna highlight the

01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:51,920
what rightscon has done for their

01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:53,760
for their virtual events this year with

01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:56,960
their connectivity fund

01:42:53,760 --> 01:43:00,639
um let me drop a link to that in

01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:02,159
the chat um so what they're doing is for

01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:03,280
their speakers and people who are

01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:05,679
presenting

01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:08,719
they can actually apply for things like

01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:10,239
um internet top-up packages and headsets

01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:11,679
like wireless microphone or like

01:43:10,239 --> 01:43:15,199
headsets and microphones

01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:16,880
for being able to participate on equal

01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:18,400
footing with people who may already have

01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:21,679
access to these things

01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:23,840
or better access to these things um

01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:24,960
so i thought this was possibly a really

01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:27,199
interesting

01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:29,040
thing we could make available in the cfp

01:43:27,199 --> 01:43:30,080
process as we get ready to start

01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:32,719
accepting

01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:34,560
proposals for possibly regional events

01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:37,679
for specific sessions and the three-day

01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:38,480
however we do it with hopn or maybe the

01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:41,119
people who are

01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:42,719
who are going to present topics um who

01:43:41,119 --> 01:43:45,520
go if we do a cfp for

01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:47,199
doing talks as well um which that's

01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:48,400
something i i'm willing to take on just

01:43:47,199 --> 01:43:50,239
because it's really just messing around

01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:51,600
with the packer repo for the templates

01:43:50,239 --> 01:43:53,760
and if i can just get feedback

01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:55,440
on how to write that stuff that would be

01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:55,920
great but i just wanted to highlight

01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:59,199
this

01:43:55,920 --> 01:44:03,440
connectivity fund as this really

01:43:59,199 --> 01:44:04,000
unique covid 19 post or mid pandemic way

01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:05,920
of

01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,280
trying to support people who may have a

01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:08,800
difficult especially

01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:10,719
folks who we've always had a strong

01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:14,000
showing of folks in latam

01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:17,360
and aipac and places that have varying

01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:18,639
stories about internet connectivity so

01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:20,159
i think it'd be great to continue

01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:21,520
supporting those people and if this is

01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:23,280
one way that makes

01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:26,800
organizing a foot or a women's day more

01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:26,800
accessible i'd love to do it

01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:32,480
i just yeah i see b's comment i just

01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:35,280
don't know i saw this conversation in

01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:36,880
amazfest because someone was struggling

01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:38,480
another person was trying to organize a

01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:40,320
virtual event and was like

01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:41,920
how do we do this like i'm really like

01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:44,000
people are asking me for this and i

01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:46,320
don't know how to handle these requests

01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:48,800
how do people fire people handling this

01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:51,440
and the feedback and that thread was

01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:52,800
um was was the writescon thread but also

01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:54,719
just saying that for

01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:57,119
like as far as where to cap it doing it

01:44:54,719 --> 01:44:57,119
for or

01:45:00,159 --> 01:45:04,880
willing to experiment for this time

01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:06,800
because no one's really done this before

01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:08,639
like i don't know it's just hard because

01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:10,639
attendees like well maybe that's five

01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:13,119
people and if it was five people then

01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:13,840
that's fine but if it's 500 people then

01:45:13,119 --> 01:45:16,000
it's like

01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:17,679
oh shoot we we said we were going to do

01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:20,400
this like 50 up to 50

01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:22,080
packages but that was before i think

01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:23,760
we'd have to set up we'd have to set a

01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:27,199
capacity somewhere

01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:28,880
just to make sure that we don't bite off

01:45:27,199 --> 01:45:29,679
more than we can chew especially as

01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:32,800
we're waiting

01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:34,159
for updated budget numbers or i don't

01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:36,480
know how that's going to play into this

01:45:34,159 --> 01:45:36,480
either

01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:40,560
but just a thought on my side like i'm

01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:43,760
really plus one

01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:44,159
to organizers and presenters i just i

01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:46,639
don't

01:45:44,159 --> 01:45:48,400
know about attendees i'm i'm open to

01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:49,760
discussing other ideas but i'm just

01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:52,400
worried that

01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:54,000
um you know if we get few requests it's

01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:55,760
fine but if we get a lot

01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:58,080
we might have to let p it might we might

01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:59,600
have to turn people down and that's

01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:01,760
never a fun thing to do

01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:03,040
to tell people actually we can't give

01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:05,440
you support

01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:05,440
sorry

01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:14,159
anyways i could open a new ticket for

01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:16,800
that given that we are out of time

01:46:14,159 --> 01:46:18,480
just on that specific conversation i

01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:22,159
also want to open a new ticket

01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:23,840
for um the gnome collaboration

01:46:22,159 --> 01:46:25,679
since we didn't get a ton of time to

01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:27,119
talk about it um

01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:28,880
but i know there's folks who are in the

01:46:27,119 --> 01:46:29,360
gnome community who i'm going to follow

01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:32,560
up with

01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:33,440
to so i'm in the process of opening two

01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:35,920
tickets

01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:36,719
i want to make a point one for the gnome

01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:39,840
oh go ahead

01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:41,040
go ahead no no no no i'll just say i'm

01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:44,639
gonna open two tickets for

01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:46,080
women's day one on um we'll call it

01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:47,600
connectivity fund or

01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:49,440
sponsoring attendees like we'll figure

01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:52,480
out the details one for that

01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:54,000
and then one for the specifically the

01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:55,440
gnome collaboration like it'd be great

01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,880
to collaborate with other communities

01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:57,280
but maybe since we're coming up on the

01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:58,960
line

01:46:57,280 --> 01:47:00,639
for this and we know we have folks in

01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:01,440
gnome who are ready to jump on and help

01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:03,840
with this

01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:04,800
we can just start with gnome plus fedora

01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:06,480
women's day

01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:08,800
start with that and figure those details

01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:11,040
out so i'm gonna open those two tickets

01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:11,040
cool

01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:17,920
um

01:47:19,679 --> 01:47:22,960
i'm going to jump off the call i'm

01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:23,280
getting a bunch of questions here in the

01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:25,199
chat

01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:27,679
i'm trying to answer and then i have to

01:47:25,199 --> 01:47:30,080
go do a lightning talk

01:47:27,679 --> 01:47:30,960
so i'm out of here for now i feel like

01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:32,400
we're

01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:36,400
getting close to the end of the time

01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:36,400
anyway or over

01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:42,400
so i can take time to type tickets and

01:47:41,199 --> 01:47:44,560
get that work done

01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:46,560
before i get pulled into the next nest

01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:47,440
thing so for me i think this is a good

01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,960
stopping point

01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:51,600
and we can try to really focus the

01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:53,199
discussion like this was helpful for me

01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:53,920
just to kind of get an idea of where we

01:47:53,199 --> 01:47:55,360
can focus

01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:57,280
perfect or women's day we have to get

01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:58,960
through all of the agenda like we never

01:47:57,280 --> 01:48:00,560
do anyways even at flock so like

01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:03,840
whatever

01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:04,480
um right but um so i'm gonna i'm gonna

01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:06,239
open those

01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:07,760
those tickets for women's day and let's

01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:16,159
try to drive their conversation

01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:16,159
