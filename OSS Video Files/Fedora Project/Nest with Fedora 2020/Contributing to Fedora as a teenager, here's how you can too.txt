fedora course the i3 window managers

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,320
special interest group they join special

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,320
interest group and

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,520
some other teams like mind share and

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,640
diversity and inclusion etc

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,119
i am a pythonista and a gopher so

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,080
i also work on patent and go python at

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,119
my day job

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,720
uh i work at i work as an engineering

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,840
intern at susta ticket

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,640
pakistan uh so here's my twitter handle

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,680
it's at the

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,360
tennessee national achievement school so

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,720
let's move so what we are going to be

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,840
talking about today is

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,880
about my journey in fedora project and

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,000
how i started with contributing because

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,479
i started out

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,079
as a google coding participant so i'm

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,200
going to be talking about a little bit

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,920
about that and

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,880
life after google code in then a little

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,600
bit about

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,960
the why diversity and inclusion matters

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,439
in foss and fedora

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,640
and the fedora dni team diversity and

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,759
inclusion

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,520
and then uh here's how you can

00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,240
contribute so if anyone

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,479
here is a fedora beginner uh we i'm

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,799
gonna introduce you to fedora join sig

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,560
and you can come and chat with us at our

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,439
communication channels in order to

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,640
become a

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,680
in order to get onboarded with fedora

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,680
so let's start

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,160
my fedora journey so it started out

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,599
around in 2019 when i was around

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,879
14 and when i

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,000
i i wanted to install linux on my laptop

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,040
and

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,360
i installed fedora because i had

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,879
used a lot of distros and did a lot of

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,760
distro hopping

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,000
in the beginning uh like i have used

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,560
almost all the major linux distributions

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,920
from

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,040
uh debian debian ones to red hat one

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,840
so i thought to try out fedora at that

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,000
time on my laptops and

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,560
what i did was google coden was

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,879
announced at that time and fedora was a

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,959
organization there so i was pretty sure

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,760
that it is fedora

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,959
and then i made some my first steps in

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,879
fedora world

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,360
like creation of your fedora account

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,840
system id and the pagio account

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,400
it was actually a task in google coding

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,519
by alicia mohanty freaky model

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,760
so she was the one who created a task

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,599
about fast id and that's where i got

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,120
started to know that this is what

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,480
fastest and

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,519
uh services like piggy which is a get uh

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,680
get get forged for fedora

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,560
so this was like pretty early steps in

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,720
fedora i

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,680
knew how everything works what is the

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,040
linux distro i always thought that

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,120
linux distros are more like um just the

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,000
installer keyword is changed in fedora

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,760
it's dnf

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,159
in the uh debian or ubuntu world it's

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,280
apt so i always thought both are similar

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,040
but after

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,080
understanding that how linux systems

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,200
work now i know how things work inside

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,000
uh and life after core google coding was

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,120
pretty interesting

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,400
because once i knew how things work a

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,200
little bit in fedora

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,159
and then i got to know that fedora 31 is

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,280
also released

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,840
and fedora has something called

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,599
release parties in which you organize a

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,040
local release party about a fedora

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,079
release what's new or for outreach for

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,960
fedora

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,520
so i organized my first fedora 31

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,600
release party in karachi pakistan

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,440
after that i saw a lot of newcomers

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,080
there who wanted to become a part of

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,639
fedora

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,680
and the best way was to point them

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,240
towards fedora join sig

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,000
so this is what i did and then i joined

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,120
the fedora joystick as a member

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,880
to improve the newcomer experience and

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,840
everything

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,520
and after that when i had when i joined

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,520
the joint sick i was able to

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,560
gain a lot of experience with working

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,919
with different

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,199
teams and six in fedora that how the

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,360
infrastructure works

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,960
was a destroy how a distro creation

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,199
works and everything

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,320
so i started exploring different teams

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,360
and

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,160
tried to contribute back so it was first

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,880
of all i started with the documentation

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,960
then mind share committee then some like

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,400
writing tasks for mind share committee

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,919
or documentation

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,240
then a little bit of community

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,400
operations work and then i started

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,479
eventually as i got familiar with the

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,720
infant code side i started with my

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,560
little code patches

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,720
in course and other parts contribute

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,960
and then i after some time i am

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,800
currently working in the diversity and

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,440
inclusion team as well

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,520
along with the i3 sig i am maintaining

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,720
the i3 security spin currently

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,840
and a little bit of tutorial section

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,000
of the fedora kos site so

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,960
this is how what my journey looks like i

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,440
was a google coding participant and then

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,280
i tried to get involved within fedora

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,160
organized a fedora release party i even

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,360
gave a talk about fedora and fossen

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,120
the release party and then i tried to

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,880
explore different teams in fedora

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,039
and selected some teams which i would

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,400
like to get started to work on

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:15,039
and i work with join seg my diversity

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,000
and inclusion team i3 second fedora cos

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,759
now

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,319
so as you can see the journey was pretty

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,560
long

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:27,360
like it was around uh it was around like

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,560
a six or eight eight months now but what

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,199
made the journey fun

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,160
because if the journey isn't fun then i

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,720
believe you

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,080
or anyone won't continue for that period

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,600
of time

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,280
so in the at the time of gci i was able

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,319
to have some awesome mentors

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,360
and who later became friends

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,440
within fedora so this is what the most

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,160
important aspect about fedora is it's

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,639
all about

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,560
it's mostly about the people that we

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,680
have and the community we have

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,919
in fedora and the second thing that

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,080
made the journey fun and exciting was

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,840
you always have some good first issues

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,199
available and they are like well

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,440
documented

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,560
to easily fix them in order to get you

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,440
familiar with the

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,199
code base because those developers who

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,800
are maintaining that project they can

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,680
easily fix that but

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,080
they try to well document that so we can

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,759
have more contributors and more people

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,520
uh getting started with that project

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,120
so you can one thing in fedora you would

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,520
find is that we have very well

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,479
documented easy fixes

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,000
and there's always something exciting

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,479
for you to work on so

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,080
fedoras too when i started out i felt

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,120
like fedo was too big

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,479
and it is and as it's too big

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,879
there's all there would always be

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,840
something exciting for you to work on

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,599
so you just have to explore different

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,120
aspects of fedora different teams and

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,280
you will find something that you would

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,759
like to learn

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,360
so this is what made my journey fun and

00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,240
exciting some awesome friends and

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,879
mentors

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,960
good first issues and there's something

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:07,360
exciting for you to work on

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:10,400
and this was my journey within fedora

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,639
how i got started and

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,479
what i currently do so i'm going to be

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,319
talking about a little diversity and

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,319
inclusion why it matters and

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,160
the context of free and open source

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:24,160
along with fedora

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,639
so why diversity matters like

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,720
when we have a non-diverse group of

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,720
people working on the same project we

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,399
all kind of have the same thoughts or

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,680
the same way of thinking

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,279
but when we get a helper get involvement

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,399
from different

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,839
from a diverse from

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,519
from people who are from diverse

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,440
backgrounds we can

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,519
improve our projects by getting new

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,160
ideas and

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,480
and like there there's a whole amount of

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,160
research on diverse teams that function

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,560
better than non-diverse teams just

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,959
because they have a lot of ways to think

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,080
and everyone can even bring something

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,200
new to the table

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,000
and a new ways to solve problems new

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,480
ways to

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,240
think about problems it can be anything

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,720
and we can learn a lot like

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,600
we can learn a lot from the ideas and

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,800
perspectives

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,080
and what they think about uh sim with

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,200
from people who are

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,640
like us and who are different from us in

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,720
many ways like

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,240
if they are from diverse backgrounds

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,760
they would have different ideas

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,040
different perspectives and different

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,040
ways of thinking

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,839
so you can learn about that and improve

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:40,160
yourself as well

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,920
so in order to uh improve diversity and

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,240
inclusion and foster diversity and

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,880
inclusion within fedora community

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,600
we have a fedora diversity and inclusion

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,600
team

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:54,080
uh which works on like here you can see

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,959
we organize fedora women's day every

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,560
year

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,560
we try to organize they speak a

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,600
non-english language

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:05,200
session or we generate video content

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,000
to spread awareness about diversity and

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,839
infidelia and like we try to connect

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,880
people with different backgrounds and we

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,079
talk about

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,040
different things and here's the image if

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,839
you can see

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,519
this one that fedora unites us all with

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,440
open source like these are people from

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,600
very diverse backgrounds very diverse

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,160
ways of working and thinking

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,320
and they all work together within fedora

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,839
so the work that i do within fedora is

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,000
about documentation

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,040
and organizing things in the issue

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
tracker

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,240
so uh what things are we working on

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,279
which needs to be focused at the moment

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,000
and

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,680
which we things we can work on later and

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,839
managing all that stuff

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,519
and why do i work with fedora diversity

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,399
and inclusion team is

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,920
like i can i get to meet a lot of people

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,640
from diverse backgrounds

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,800
and whom we i wouldn't meet in my

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,120
day-to-day job

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,079
so if you would like to chat with us you

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,920
can join us at

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:06,000
hashtag fedora minus diversity on

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,040
freenode and we are also bridged with

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,360
telegram at the

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,240
fedora diversity and that that's a

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,200
bridge between ioc and telegram

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,279
so this is the work that i do within the

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,200
fedora diversity and inclusion team

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,399
and this is the work that fedora d and i

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,240
do this is an awesome

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,920
infographic that was created by

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,800
smebagoyl who's an

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,800
outreachy intern about from for the

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,279
fedora design team she was having a

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,920
exciting sessions later do visit that

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,000
you're going to

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,600
learn a lot about fedora design and

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,040
badges design

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,360
so let's say like this is this was the

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,160
work that i was doing within fedora how

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,560
i started

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,079
the work that i do now i'm going to be

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,920
talking about

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,839
how you can get started with fedora so

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,279
there we have a special interest group

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,600
our team in fedora

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,760
that works on improving the newcomer

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,839
experience and trying to structuralize

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,000
the process how we can

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:06,160
onboard newcomers and direct them

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,560
towards the things they want to work on

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,200
so the fedora joint stage is like a

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,800
special

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:15,440
the interest group which maintains like

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,320
chance to engage newcomers within the

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,720
community

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,279
you can chat with us at uh fedora join

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,399
on freenode and join fedora on telegram

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,000
so the work that i do here is like the

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,240
only thing that i work

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
mostly i work on is finding ways to

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,040
improve the newcomer experience in

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,040
fedora

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,120
because what we have is we have a

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,639
process to formally introduce people

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,920
within fedora and i'm

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,839
i work on improving that experience for

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,040
newcomers and making it more engaging

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,399
more fun

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,800
and i help with onboarding newcomers

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,240
i run and help in organizing classrooms

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,639
so

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,800
in the past year we have conducted six

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,440
classrooms on containers container

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,680
images

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,560
creating fedora badges fedora silver

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,200
blue

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:05,360
uh localization 101 electrics

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,200
so these are all available on the fedora

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,880
youtube channel do visit that you're

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,440
going to learn a lot from them as well

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,279
so

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,600
i try to run the classrooms

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,440
and help in organizing them and i

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,440
maintain some docs within the fedora

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,160
joint as well with the welcome side of

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,600
things

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:27,200
so why i work with the join sig because

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,720
after code google code in i didn't get

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,279
to go through the process that we

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,920
currently have and that was a little

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:37,040
hard for me to

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:40,240
get started with fedora without that

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,839
so uh i was a newcomer too and i faced

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,720
some hurdles which i

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,360
would like that the newcomers who are

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,480
coming within the fedora community

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,959
uh they shouldn't face that so uh

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,399
we are working on a welcome process we

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,639
have a welcome process and i

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,480
try to we are working on improving that

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,480
and how can we

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,800
make it more fun and exciting so

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,680
let's take an example of a fedora

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,519
contributor here is a badger who thinks

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,800
that they would like to contribute to

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,399
the fedora project

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,240
and when you would see the fedora

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,440
organization chart which provides you

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,600
the overall view of

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,800
the things that we do so you are going

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,000
to find things like

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,720
operating system developer translation

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,199
web development content writing are your

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,040
people's person you are a designer

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,480
and for me it was like i can work with

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,600
most of these things

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,279
so where to get started like even i was

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,399
confused that we have all of these

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,839
things in fedora

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:43,760
and where should i get started

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,959
so we have a fedora joint sig here what

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,760
you can do is you can

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,880
talk to us we provide like we have

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,440
someone

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,240
we have we mostly have someone present

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,839
on the channel

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,560
so to help you and make to help you

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,120

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,040
uh these things and you can provide your

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,279
introduction there and we can point you

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,440
towards the things that you would

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,000
that you could be interested in working

on so this is our welcome process that

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,600
we are currently working on

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,199
so if you're confused talk to us within

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,360
the join sig we are gonna create a

good one

blog post on welcome to fedora uh

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,440
about defining the process on how we

introduce people

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:27,520

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,440
link here

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,440
so here it is

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:40,000
welcome this is our workflow

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,200
yep this one so

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,200
this is the post

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:50,799
uh that i would like to share is it's

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,799
it's about the welcome to fedora process

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,799
that we have within fedora

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,799
and how can you get started with it

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,120
where you can join where you can join

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,160

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,960

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,640
plus one to alberto for the comment

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,440
about contributing as a personal

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,720
experience

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,120
and the the best thing that we can do is

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,320
like

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,400
direct the newcomers to the joint stick

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,400
and the joystick will like

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,520
take care of the rest by introducing

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,840
them to the

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,840
things that they would like to work on

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:29,679
hush i've dropped the link there

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:35,840
