hi everyone

00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,720
and welcome to the federal course docs

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,840
access

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:15,599
um so i should be

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:18,320
presenting with jonathan the bomb

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,640
but he has some issues so i will start

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,840
and

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,080
uh i'll let him try to work out his

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,920
issues and he will join us soon

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:30,000
but we don't need much to present and

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,679
so that that will be fine so welcome

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,480
everyone

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,920
the the goal here today is to work on

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,079
docs for ferrari caress

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,760
so hopefully you have a basic idea of

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,480
what federal course is

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,960
if you don't that's fine you can check

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,680
out

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,320
the links you can check out the website

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,680
and i've pasted in the chat

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,559
a hack md link which is

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,280
a convenient way to share information

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,399
and you

00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,600
should also be you should also

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,120
see the the hacking d shadow on the

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,159
screen

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,160
and so the

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,799
the general id is that

00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:14,080

docks uh

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,840
during this hacks fest and so the

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:25,119
easiest way to do it is to do it

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,360
together at the same time and hopefully

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,680

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,360
the id

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:42,400
here is um so the source

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,840
i cannot point on my screen but maybe i

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,360
can highlight

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,400
so the sources are here

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,519
for the federal chorus

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,120
and the version that is displayed is

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,680
available for everyone

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,239
is here that's the official federal

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,280
course

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,440
federal docs websites and

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,480
unfortunately the website is not updated

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,720
every time

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,159
somebody commits and everyone every time

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,720
a commits gets in

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,519
so it's lagging a little bit behind it's

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,400
it did

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,879
something like once a day so you will

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,159
not

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,239
have the pleasure of doing your work

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,480
be available right now on the website

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,599
you will have to wait for tomorrow

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,840
um the ide

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,680
so if you need any help with fedora

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,879
quest you can start with the existing

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,360
documentation there are instructions for

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,920
either

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,159
launching in cloud providers or directly

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,400
on your system

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,159
and of course if you want to work on the

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,799
docs you will probably want to

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,879
preview the the changes that you've made

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,230
locally and that's easily done

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,920
by the link here

00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,920
[Music]

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,239
by the very short instructions you

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,830
basically need podman.docker

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,680
and that's it

00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:59,519
[Music]

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,360
writing documentation is great but

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,560
making it available to more people

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,760
is also great so we if you want to work

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,599
on the translation

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,799
you can head over there to the

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,400
translation

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:15,519
page so i'll give it a quick look here

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,560
so that's the federal course

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,320
documentation the translation page

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,160
i think this one is in french because

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,720
i'm in france and

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,680
you can go over each page and translate

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,720
strings

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,000
in the documentation that's that's

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,720
easy and yeah that would

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,720
greatly help

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,240
if you want if you ready to go in and

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,240
dive

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,240
into federal course and write new docs

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:49,199
we've made a sample pr

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:52,080
here on github uh oh let's not see one

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,720
let's you know sorry uh so if you want

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,960
to go in

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,520
anyway i've made some suggestions about

00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,039
what we you could work on and

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,759
help us do so it's on the fedora course

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,759
docs on github repo on github and we've

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,240
labeled the issue with good first issues

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,160
and dark access

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,000
to help you get started feel free to ask

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,960
questions directly in the issues or in

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,639
the chat

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:21,360
and we'll try to help um

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,360
so the documentation itself

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:30,400
um yeah you can put most pages

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:33,199
uh in in the system configuration

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,680
section it's okay if that's not an issue

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,720
we will move pages if not necessary

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,160
so we yeah we made as i said before we

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,800
made a sample pr

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,440
to help you get started so if you want

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,000
to

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,560
like get the basics of how to create a

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,600
page

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,980
uh in the docs that's the chances that

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,179
you will need to do here

00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,179
[Music]

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:03,759
okay so we are quite a bunch here

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:08,160
and i will be monitoring the chats

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:10,960
and and github soon but the

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,000
to avoid stepping on each other so the

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,759
goal is to

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,120
you should have access to this document

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,319
i think it's

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,319
oh it's limited to

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,880
signing user so yes as soon as you've

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,199
signed in into rcmd

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,160
you should be able to edit edit it so

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,400
you can see the

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,199
edit mark here you can go there it's

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,919
marked down

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,250
and if you want to work on a specific

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,680
issue

00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,240
[Music]

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,400
please add yourself here as your as your

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,880
name and the issue you want to work on

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,600
so that we don't work on the same

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,880
everybody

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,240
does not work on the same issue and we

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,880
can assign an issue to

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,560
to to people on github so if you use

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,550
your github his name

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,000
that will work great

00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,280
[Music]

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,599
um so yeah we prefer github waffles or

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,880
git and pr's but if not not comfortable

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,000
with that it's okay

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,479
you you can do uh direct contribution

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,919
using

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:10,479
rcmd uh so

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,080
similar to what we're showing right now

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,680
and

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,880
and we will do what's necessary to make

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,039
this into a

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,639
final pr once once we uh once you're

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,280
ready

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,840
and that's fine one note about hacking

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,479
uh

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,160
the the preview mode of hack md doesn't

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,880
really support ascii dot

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,240
um but if you just use the plain text uh

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,400
editor mode

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,599
you know it's just plain text on your

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,520
screen so

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,970
um don't worry too much about the

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,149
rendering

00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,149
[Music]

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:50,000
yeah and thanks dusty and the last uh

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,240
the last things we that you

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,599
can do is testing the actual docs the

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,960
current documentation

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,199
that we have to make sure that it's

00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:01,919
still relevant and still working

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:04,960
and so at the same time here

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,720
the same idea here we don't want to all

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,479
work on the same page so if you want to

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,759
work on specific pages and try it and

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,520
verify it

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,520
you can add your name here in the docs

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,160
and to to tell everybody that you're

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:22,000
working on this page for example

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,720
and so so we can split the work

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
just a quick note as we are still

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,280
updating the tutorials

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,080
for the sunday workshop i suggest that

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,560
you do not

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,919
work on them because they are already

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,200
changed from the version that is

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,000
displayed in the docs

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,399
so if you work on them please do it from

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,719
the

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,080
the the question that is in the

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,360
repository

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,800
in current master and expect changes to

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,160
it so

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,800
yeah everything else should be

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,200
in in better shape but well they they

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,080
are

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,440
okay but they are not they are not fully

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,640
fully completed

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,519
and that's about it so timothy uh

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,640
quick question on the testing so um if

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,040
somebody wants to

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,320
grab one of those sections to to just

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,720
run through and make sure the

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,240
documentation looks good

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:17,120
i just added an example in that section

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,320
that says my username and i will try to

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,680
test this one

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,839
does that look like what you were

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,399
expecting so if you scroll down on your

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,480
screen

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,480
um yeah yeah that's great

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:37,839
maybe make it like a bold and that's

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:37,839
that would be perfect

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:51,839
there you go

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,040
oh good are there any questions

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,000
otherwise

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,399
i'll leave the floor to you and let's

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,839
let's

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,839
do some ducks

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,160
if you're more comfortable asking

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,839
questions directly so there's chad

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,959
there's the ic channel there's here

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,760
you can ask for

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,959
for voice access if i understood

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,480
correctly in open

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:33,839
so you should be able to ask questions

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:33,839
directly if you'd like

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,839
uh

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:27,200
timothy question so when i

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:30,000
tried to get access for sharing my

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,279
uh audio and videos i had to click a

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,320
button and then like say

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,120
apply to get added to the session did

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,320
you approve

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,399
me is that how i got added or okay

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,240
that's weird i didn't do anything you

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,959
you got in

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,279
okay i'm not sure how that works then

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,120
because

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,040
there was a period of time between when

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,240
i applied and when i got in

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,519
um so yeah i think jonathan might be

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,880
having some trouble

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,760
getting uh his video and audio shared

00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,360
too but

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,480
we'll just deal with those issues we've

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,760
got the uh the event the session

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,720
um channel here in hopkin and then also

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,760
fedora core os

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,160
on free node um so if people have any

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:25,839
questions

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:25,839
just ask those there

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,480
hey can you hear me okay now

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,720
i think you're muted but by your

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,519
expression i think it's yeah

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,000
oh you can't hear me i can hear timothy

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,120
i'm not

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,160
sure jonathan is here

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,160
yeah it's you jonathan

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,880
can you say something now yep yep can

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,079
you hear me

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,120
yeah yeah i can hear you all right

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:44,160
phew welcome thanks

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:49,839
thanks for uh leading the

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,839
uh beginning dusty and

00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:02,160
so jonathan as a user coming into this

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:05,680
uh what would you do in order to

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,240
uh contribute to the docs what's your

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,240
first step

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:20,720
i think i would fork the repo

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,279
and then i would clone it locally and i

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,639
would just

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,639
try to build and preview it

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,920
on my laptop and then once i have that

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,959
then i can you know

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,360
maybe see what uh what issues interest

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,639
me

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,519
or if i've never tried ferocores before

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,079
i would definitely either try to use

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,800
libert

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,320
or chemu to to play around with it and

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:47,199
just make sure i understand like

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:49,279
how to pass an ignition config to the vm

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,560
and if you've never used fedora coreos

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,760
before

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:56,720
you can easily sign up to just test a

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,720
section of the docs

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,800
and you know make sure that it's good

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,360
for a new user right

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,160
so that's that's a good way to

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,279
contribute as well

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:10,639
timothy um do you want to pull up

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,360
on that your screen share the example pr

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,680
to

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,399
the github repo and just step through

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,399
that briefly

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:32,000
so here you should be able to see let me

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:35,279
check yeah the example pr for

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,240
the repo that we've made uh

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:41,839
so it's in the docks over here in the

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,839
middle here

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:49,199
and the basic idea

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:52,639
is if you you start with

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:55,759
adding your page here in the nav

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,759
section so it's it's basically a file

00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,519
which lists all the sections that are in

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,040
the documentation so

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,120
you can see here it's been it's

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:08,050
underneath authentication

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:11,280
cannot tuning so that would get under

00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,280
[Music]

00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,389
[Music]

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,120
they're right here and

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,279
once you've added the page here so you

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,959
see here you had just the name

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,399
of the document that you want to

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,800
reference

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,920
you need to put the full pass and here

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,519
you just created in

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,079
almost the same directory just

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,279
underneath the pages directory here you

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,750
add a new page

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,959
same name oh which is wrong

00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,440
[Music]

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,040
you did not put the same name i'll go

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,519
fix that

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,120
yeah i i called it new example but then

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,000
i just changed it to example and i

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,120
didn't change the file

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,759
name so i'll give it that's all right

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,320
so yeah you you write directly husky dog

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,600
here

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,440
and that will create you do a page for

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,360
you

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,880
i can show that was a test

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:18,319
that was a test i wanted to make sure

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:21,360
you caught it in code reviews

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:23,919
and yeah yeah husky dog is like

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,400
close to mark down but not exactly the

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,120
same

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,160
so depending on how comfortable you are

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,080
with muck down

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,480
it's going to be easy

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,880
i don't know if the reference is here

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:47,840
somewhere maybe we can find it

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:47,840
there should be some reference here

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,280
well it doesn't already

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,000
it's it's easy to like copy paste from

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,970
the existing

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,559
dock i would say that's is the way to go

00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:15,840
[Music]

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:15,840
so i'm pinged what's happening

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,919
so for some of the issues i added a

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,640
acceptance criteria to try to

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,679
make it clear what we wanted out of the

00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,840
issue

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,120
but i didn't get through all of them but

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,200
if if you have a doubt

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,559
about um or some of them some of them

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,559
are maybe already

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,600
clear enough so if you have a doubt

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,559
about what

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,679
needs to to get done for for a specific

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:25,840
issue you can

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:25,840
you can ask us in chat or any issues

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,400
i have a question about translations

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:03,120
so how does that typically work

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:06,400
do is there anything that's auto

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:10,159
auto translated or is it

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,559
completely all um like kind of manually

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,679
done

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:16,240
and so for example if i go in

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,480
and i change a section like i change a

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,280
paragraph

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,679
uh do does somebody then need to go in

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,520
and

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,520
like change the translation

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:32,480
yeah so if i go to the translation

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,480
website

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:49,840
and here

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:49,840
let me just sign in

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,840
yep

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:17,039
so if i go to federal course

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,919
and so

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,919
previously i had done all of those disco

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,760
for index for example there are some

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,320
strings to check here

00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,559
[Music]

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,880
oh so there have been changes so that's

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,600
a good example of what you ask

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,880
i had translated the initial index page

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,640
in french for

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,400
for the fedora quest docs and so they

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,919
have been changes and they are shown

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,679
here

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:47,120
and so you've got

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:49,280
so the change is the

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,240
english version the new english version

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,000
which has double spaces

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,480
so it should be fixed and that's the

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,799
final uh

00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,520
french version that i had originally

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,200
that i

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,200
should update

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:12,000
okay cool i'll just edit this one and

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:14,000
when it's done i'll go save so

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,760
i'll do this in a second but just

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,880
underneath you can see

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,600
all of the strings that i have to that i

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,280
have that

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:26,799
are there to translate and some

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:30,559
checks here

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:33,200
how does it um how does it break up

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,760
into different sections does it just use

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,880
like a single line of text or does it

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:42,000
uh just do paragraphs like if i

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,919
if i write a section of documentation

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,880
and i manually line break

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,000
a couple of times does it pick that up

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,720
or no

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,720
i think it's paragraphs but

00:22:52,799 --> 00:23:01,280
so far from what i've seen cool

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:06,640
okay thanks for the tutorial

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,640
sure yeah somebody started translating

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,840
here

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,440
okay so i'm gonna start hacking on some

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,640
docs

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,720
um you know i'll periodically look at

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,080
the chat and the channel here and also

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,720
in fedora core os

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,760
and you know if anybody has any

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,240
questions

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,000
ask to share your audio or video or post

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,190
them in the chat and

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,390
happy hacking

00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,390
[Music]

00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:54,410
[Music]

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:05,840
did update the example pr so it should

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,840
be better

00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:26,809
[Music]

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,349

00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:09,200

00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,500

00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:53,410
[Music]

00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,970
[Music]

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:17,760
seems like we have a couple questions

00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,760
about translations um

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,760
maybe we can debug raphael's issue

00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,640
on your screen timothy and for sylvia

00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,840
maybe we can do

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,519
um like uh

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,600
how to get started with translations

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:35,519
brief mini tutorial

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:39,440
yeah so let me

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:42,960
so you get in constant and check i'll do

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:46,399
a recap translation so that

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:53,840
um so let me write this one

00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:53,840
as in progress

00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:00,159
so if you go on the haccmd

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,600
you can see here the link for

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,720
translations

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,919
so it's the fedora translate the web

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,720
late

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,720
service so if i go there

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,480
you here you need to sign in you should

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,119
sign in it's i think it's not required

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,440
but it's better if you sign in using

00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:24,960
your fedra account

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,839
id because you can then directly

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,480
save the translations and that's easier

00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,839
for you

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,520
and for everybody you will get more

00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:38,079
power

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:40,879
in a way so once you sign in here

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,240
you should go to the federal course page

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,839
so if you're on the dashboard for

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,839
example and you want to look for it

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,560
you can go over here look at the project

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:55,599
bruise all projects and then you can

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,599
search for chorus

00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:06,960
or os oops and there you go

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:09,599
so i would recommend to

00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,079
let's say get started with the easiest

00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,560
one

00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:16,560
is index it's a basic page landing page

00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,119
so you should click here on the index

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,680
page you will see multiple language

00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,880
if your language is not already there

00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,160
you should do

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:31,359
start a new translation

00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:34,079
and then you have to choose language

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:37,280
pick the one you want to do and go ahead

00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,280
and start the new translation

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,640
once you've done that you should be

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,720
created either with a page like this

00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,240
with all the language or directly here

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,320
on the page here

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,320
so it's if you click on translate

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:58,079
you can yeah you get

00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:00,720
in into this interface here where you

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,359
get all the strings to translate and you

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,320
get them

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:06,320
one by one so you have to read the

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,200
english version here

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:12,640
and translate it here in a language once

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,280
you're done if you feel like it's okay

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,000
the position is perfect you you don't

00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,480
think it

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,760
needs any work you can go and save it

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,320
directly

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,880
if you feel like it's not complete or

00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,680
maybe

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,000
you should be better you can go and

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,480
check

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,200
the box here to say that it needs

00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,280
editing

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:35,440
or put it as a suggestion

00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,280
or if you don't want to do this string

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,880
right now you can just keep it

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,800
and move to the next one and so that

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,960
just right here you will go through all

00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,240
of this all of the text

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,839
and you should translate every each one

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,599
of them

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,200
uh if you want to skip to speak to a

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,200
specific one you can go

00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,839
underneath here you've got all the

00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:02,720
strings to translate and you can click

00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:02,720
on one and you will be sent to it

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,359
you can wear short and right for this

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,440
box here

00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:11,119
things to check sometimes when you make

00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,520
mistakes so

00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,359
if they are something that is

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,240
inconsistent

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:20,000
you will you will get a warning here and

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,520
you can see

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,420
well depends on the issue you have

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,079
does that helps

00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:37,839
[Music]

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:37,839
let me check the chat

00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,079
usually you can like override most of

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,480
the web later

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,880
checks so if you think you're right you

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:33,839
just go ahead and overwrite it

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:33,839
and it doesn't matter

00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:10,400
weird is translate.fedoraproject.org

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:13,599
down for anybody other than me

00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,599
if you try to open a new one

00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,520
working here just me

00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,280
that's good news cause i'm glad

00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,800
everybody who's editing things in a

00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,000
browser window

00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:32,800
isn't going to lose something

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,800
it's dns

00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:39,839
always always

01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:54,799
timothy we got a specific question about

01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:59,039
translations in the

01:03:54,799 --> 01:04:03,119
chat um maybe you can help sylvia

01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:06,240
with that particular issue right so

01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:08,960
when you have links so let me

01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,960
find this one

01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:15,119
when you have links you have to keep the

01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:26,000
links in english

01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:29,520
so this one should be

01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,520
it the index maybe

01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:46,160
yeah so here so

01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:48,640
you can see here the in the source in

01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:50,960
english you have the link here

01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:52,000
so that that part you have to keep it as

01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,960
is

01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,119
and then you get the actual content that

01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,680
is displayed to the user and that's the

01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:00,880
one

01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:01,359
the one you want to translate so here

01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,760
has

01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:04,400
translated it into french and everything

01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:09,839
else have

01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:09,839
kept houses

01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:05,839
okay

01:06:44,839 --> 01:06:47,839
so

01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:15,839
okay

01:07:26,839 --> 01:07:29,839
okay

01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:57,839
okay

01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:03,199
i think

01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:08,719
is there a time this session ends by the

01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:11,920
way

01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:15,679
it's yeah that's about it technically

01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:15,679
11 50 so now

01:47:16,159 --> 01:47:20,800
okay cool i don't know uh you know we

01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:23,840
might get kicked out at some point

01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:25,760
i'm sure people have uh other sessions

01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:29,360
they they might want to join as well

01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:32,320
um should we kind of

01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:34,560
close out the session uh and you know

01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:36,719
obviously what people are working on

01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:37,679
they'll open pr's and we'll just go

01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:41,360
through it that way

01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:43,679
um and obviously if people have

01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:45,040
questions we're also in fedora core os

01:47:43,679 --> 01:47:50,239
on freenode

01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:52,719
um so we'll be available

01:47:50,239 --> 01:47:53,600
yeah and uh i mean if you want to

01:47:52,719 --> 01:47:54,960
contribute

01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:57,520
like if you're doing translation right

01:47:54,960 --> 01:48:01,119
now but you also want to

01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:04,560
um contribute with the adding new docs

01:48:01,119 --> 01:48:06,880

01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:09,280
in the github repo with the good first

01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:13,360
issue label so you can always

01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:15,840
you know after after this hackfest

01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:16,400
pick whatever you want and docs are
